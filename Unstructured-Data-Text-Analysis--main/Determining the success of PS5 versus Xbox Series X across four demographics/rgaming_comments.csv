If not more, as to why they do it I have no idea but I do my best to put the person being a dick in place. My girlfriend won't even use her mic unless we are in a private party with friends. She doesn't play competitive games much so she isnt faced with it often, but it still happens. 

I personally think it comes down to insecurity issues, I expect that the ones who stoop down to that level have next to no social life outside of video games, or have just never interacted with women before, who knows?   

I've raided with a fair share of women on Destiny, and most of the time they won't talk at all.  Friend of mine noticed this one night, we started a group invited people in we're chatting and what not, noticed not everyone was talking. When asked why, we heard a girl speak up saying she was there, but not talking. This was 15 minutes in with no talk, my friend said not to worry about us being assholes towards her and to feel free to carry on with us and enjoy the raid. She came out of her shell and we still play with her to this day.  That being said, it makes you wonder how many of the people out there that say they don't have a mic but really do.  I mean all the new consoles come with them!

I'm horrible when it comes to ranting via text lol. I'll end it here before I get lost.  I wish I had an answer as to why there were so many toxic gamers towards women but I dont, just assumptions.

The easiest conclusion to make is that they are simply not socially comfortable talking to people (especially women in the case you bring up), and they just want to feel superior rather than you know, socialize. 

 I think there is an elephant in the room with subliminal sexism implanted in anyone who consumes media, especially films where weak female characters seem abundant in the fast sea of box office hits.  Despite that, I feel the individuals who do go after you have some chip on their shoulders and live very lonely lives and are taking out their frustrations on the females they encounter during their sessions.

I'm kidding. But the science is a little cooler than the oils and age theory:

> The Super NES, as well as our other systems, are made with a plastic containing flame-retardant chemicals to meet safety guidelines. Over time, the plastic will age and discolor both because of these chemicals as well as from the normal heat generated from the product or exposure to light. Because of the light color of the plastic of the SNES and NES, this discoloration is more easily seen than with other darker plastics such as on the N64 and the Nintendo GameCube.

What frustrates me is all of these ""I'd do it for $20"" is why when I design a proper logo for a company, they want to pay me chump change for what CAN be easy, but if it's done right is very painstaking.

RVL means Revolution. Or with the case of the GameCube, DOL-001 (for Dolphin). The first 3 letters are generally an abbreviation for what the product was codenamed during development.

GameBoy Advance: AGB-001 (Advanced GameBoy).

GameBoy Color: CGB-001 (Color GameBoy).

GameBoy: DMG-001 (Dot Matrix Game).

Wii U: WUP-002 (Wii U Project).

Nintendo DS: NTR-001 (Nitro)

Nintendo DSi: TWL-001 (Twilight)

Not everything follows this convention, though:
Switch: HAC-001 (personally, since the Switch is the 8th generation console, and ‚Äúhachi‚Äù is the number 8 in Japanese, I think it just means ‚Äúeight‚Äù)

N64: NUS-001 (Nintendo Ultra Sixty-Four)? thank you u/JmcmProgrammer

NES: literally NES-001

SNES: SNS-001 (super nintendo system?)

DS Lite: USG-001

New 3DS (original, not XL): KTR-001

il6y6e,gendabenda,"I don't understand why you can't just like both? Some things are better on PC (FPS games, MMOs, strategy games) some are better on console (action, platforming, racing, sports, some RPGs) 

PC Gaming is still hobby-based - it costs a decent amount of money, it requires some computer skills and isn't as well-known or accessible as console games (imagine trying to buy a steam game for your grandson?). It's an absolute blast, but it's more complicated and much less regulated. 

Console gaming is streamlined for mass-consumption. You lose some of the individuality (I can't change anything about the console - speed, memory, case, nothing), and innovation happens at a much slower pace (so many cool indie games show up on PC first and many never make it to console - an issue that is being worked on but still a gap). But, it's a single-box solution that works identically for everyone the moment you plug it in and turn it on. The hottest games are in giant box displays at Walmart and shown nonstop on commercials. The buttons largely work the same that they have for 20+ years (looking at you, dualshock) and the UI is meticulously designed to be accommodating and as intuitive as possible.

I don't think it's a very clear design, but I admire that you explored this idea.

My thoughts:

The PS logo has a P standing upright and an S laid flat on the ground.  This makes them look 3D, which they probably originally did because when the logo was first created, 3D gaming was new and they wanted to make it a part of the system's logo.

With that in mind.  The P and the S have clear spatial positioning in the original logo.  It's nice to look at because we can immediately understand the P and the S in a 3d space.  So if you are going to add another letter, it should also have a clear position.  The 5 in this logo isn't really placed in that 3D space at all.  The way it overlaps the P suggests that it's placed in front of the P, which means it's not actually hovering over the S (which is behind the P).  (If you imagine walking around the logo and seeing it from another angle, you'd see that the S is just floating over nothingness)

But the ends of the 5 are occluded by white ""margins"" outlining the P the same way the S is.  With the S, this suggests that it's being occluded by the P.  With the 5, it also has that appearance--but that wouldn't make sense, since the 5 is occluding the P and is clearly in front of it.

Also, why doesn't the S have its own white margins that occlude the P, like how the P does for the S?  (In reality, I think it would be too cluttered-looking and wouldn't work; it'd also break up the nice straight backbone of the P which contrasts nicely with the curvy S. ...But without the white margin it just looks inconsistent)

Also, the S hides most of the S that wasn't already hidden by the P.  The S isn't really legible any more.  And it also seems to read as P5S instead of PS5.

Lastly, I see you had to lengthen the backbone of the P in order to fit the extra letter.  I think it unbalances the logo's shape.  The normal logo has a nice triangularity to it (two curves of the S and the top of the P; also, the negative space inside the letters) and it's kind of lost when you stretch it like this.

I still love seeing stuff like this even if I don't think it works though!",78,1561400087.0,/r/gaming/comments/c4qbk3/my_proposal_for_a_ps5_logo/
