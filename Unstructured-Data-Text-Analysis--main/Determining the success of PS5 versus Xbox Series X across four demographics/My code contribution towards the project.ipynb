    "Reddit is a social media platform that's essentially a forum. The forum is comprised of many different forums dedicated to specific topics called subreddits. Users who sign up on Reddit typically give an anonymous username meaning that it's not like Facebook nor Twitter and there is a certain element of anonymity towards the posts. There are default subreddits that every account is subscribed to when an account is created but otherwise, a user will have to search out subreddits that cater towards their own tastes. Certain subreddits also make themselves difficult to find in order to maintain a more hardcore community. "

    "With that in mind, Reddit is ideal towards somewhat isolating certain demographics. We consider the casual demographic to be r/gaming since it is a default subreddit and is mostly humor and images. We consider r/games to be the hardcore more dedicated demographic of gamers since users have to go out of their way to find that subreddit. We also decide to look at the dedicated fanbases for Xbox and PS5 in their own respective subreddits. For Xbox, the xboxone subreddit is more active than the xboxseriesx subreddit so we elect r/xboxone to be representative of the Xbox fanbase. "

    "Additionally, Reddit differs itself from other forums by having an upvote and downvote system. In theory, upvotes are for things in topic and downvotes are for out of topic but in practice, redditors use it to upvote sentiments they agree with and downvote sentiments that they don't agree with. Posts and comments that are upvoted are seen by more people as those appear first when sorting by hot or best and are often the default way of displaying things. Thus, we decide to use this behavior to our advantage by analyzing comments and submissions that pass a certain number of upvotes in order to capture the most popular sentiments for each demographic."
