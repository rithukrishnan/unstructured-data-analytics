There are so many repetitive question posts, console warring and the like. So consider this just a nice little ('little') post to go through until we'll have new stuff and interesting news in the coming weeks. I hope this will be informative and organized enough.

# SIE Worldwide Studios - Projects

**Naughty Dog**

After over three years of anticipation, fears, doubts, delays and controversies, Naughty Dog finally released *The Last of Us Part II* back in June to critical acclaim and high sales.

* Naughty Dog's next big project still seems to be lightyears away, and according to vice president and creative director Neil Druckmann mentioned in a June [interview](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/the-last-of-us-part-ii-neil-druckmann-interview) with him that at the time he is still unsure what will be Naughty Dog's next project; it could be a third installment in *The Last of Us* franchise, or it could be an entirely new IP - which would be ND's first new IP since the original *The Last of Us* in 2013.
* Naughty Dog has been reported (and later confirmed in a tweet) to be working on a successor to ""Factions"", the multiplayer mode of *The Last of Us*. *The Last of Us Part II* was Naughty Dog's first game since *Uncharted: Drake's Fortune* (2007) to not include a multiplayer mode at launch, partly to focus most of the resources into the single-player campaign, and partly to [fully realize](https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1177392945458286595) Factions' own ambitions as its own thing. Recently, we also had [leaked footage of what appears to be the game in progress](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-last-of-us-2-factions-multiplayer-gameplay-leak/).
* Finally, and take this with a massive grain of salt given the source, a post originating on 4Chan and later getting reposted on both Reddit and ResetEra [claims](https://gamerant.com/new-naughty-dog-ip-details-leak/) that Naughty Dog is already working on a new IP, tentatively called *Stray's Cross*. This game is rumored to be some post-apocalyptic, Steampunk title with first-person perspective, a departure from Naughty Dog's usual third-perspective style. The rumor also mentions that the two leads are a female scientist and a male fugitive. An even earlier rumor (dates to October 2018) by a man called Daniel Richtman (who is apparently correct with his leaks on entertainment stuff) [mentions details of one of the leads' casting preferences](https://twitter.com/DanielRPK/status/1050103179629744128), of a black/African-American man in his 40's-60's, with a picture of *The Walking Dead* actor Chad Coleman. Whether this casting refers to the new IP (whose 4Chan rumor came a year later), or something *TLOU*\-related remains to be seen.

&#x200B;

**Insomniac Games**

At the time of this post's writing, Insomniac Games is the most recent member of the SIE Worldwide Studios, having been acquired in 2019 after decades of close relationship with Sony and the PlayStation. Having shipped 2018's *Spider-Man* to critical acclaim and extremely strong sales, Insomniac Games was one of the first studios to have its rumored PS5 projects shown in June's Future of Gaming event.

* [*Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai3o0XtrnM8&t) and [*Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzuHo80U2M) were unveiled during the Future of Gaming event. The former has been either speculated or rumored for a while and is built around the PlayStation 5's SSD to allow its unique dimension-hopping design, and [features](https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/female-lombax-in-ratchet-clank-rift-apart-will-be-playable-2689897) new playable character in addition to series protagonist Ratchet. The latter is a standalone spin-off to 2018's *Spider-Man* and has been [compared in scope](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/06/correction_spider-man_miles_morales_is_a_brand_new_standalone_ps5_game_similar_to_uncharted_lost_legacy) and style to Naughty Dog's *Uncharted: The Lost Legacy*. *Miles Morales* was also [said](https://ew.com/gaming/game-on-inside-marvel-games/) to be a ""complete story"" and character arc, and offers [a performance mode of 4K / 60 FPS](https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1285225145909620736).
* *Miles Morales*, however, is not the only *Spider-Man* game in works it seems. The first game left several open plot threads for a more proper sequel, and Insomniac Games recently promised that they have [plenty to tell](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/06/insomniac_has_much_of_peterrs_story_left_to_tell_for_marvels_spider-man_2_on_ps5) regarding Peter's story.
* Also just to clear some things about *Sunset Overdrive* and an hypothetical sequel: Insomniac Games stated they would love [making a sequel for the game](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/13/insomniac-would-love-to-make-sunset-overdrive-2-ign-unfiltered). As of 2019, Sony - having acquired Insomniac (who owns the rights for the IP) - is now the [owner](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/09/sunset_overdrive_is_now_owned_by_playstation_sony_confirms) of the *Sunset Overdrive* IP. However, former SIE Worldwide Studios head Shawn Layden said that the IP is [not a priority](https://www.gamesradar.com/playstation-isnt-prioritising-sunset-overdrive-2-in-wake-of-insomniac-acquisition/) for Sony at the time of the interview. Whether this will change or has changed after Layden's departure is to be seen.

&#x200B;

**Guerrilla Games**

Guerrilla Games experienced some sort of new breakthrough with the PS4 generation, releasing the beloved *Horizon Zero Dawn* to great success and creating the acclaimed Decima game engine which was used for *Until Dawn* (2015) and *Death Stranding* (2019) in addition to *Horizon* and 2013's *Killzone Shadow Fall*.

* [*Horizon Forbidden West*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq594XmpPBg&t) was speculated & rumored for a while and was all but confirmed before its full announcement in the Future of Gaming event. It was rumored to have [originally started](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/04/rumour_horizon_zero_dawn_2_initially_planned_for_ps4_before_moving_to_ps5) as a PlayStation 4 project before shifting away entirely to Sony's upcoming console. It is slated for a [2021 release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIyz_7Hz3U4) and will feature [new Machines](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/07/guerrilla_details_new_machines_in_horizon_forbidden_west_on_ps5) to take on.
* This might be a given, but another pre-announcement report claims that the IP has evolved into a [trilogy](https://www.newsbreak.com/news/1553194329351/horizon-zero-dawn-story-will-be-a-trilogy-according-to-report) and *Horizon III* is all but guaranteed at some point after the second game's launch.
* It also seems that Guerrilla Games is working on another project outside the *Horizon* series (or maybe related to them?); as early as May 2018, the studio has [began recruiting](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2018/05/horizon_developer_guerrilla_games_recruiting_for_new_game) for a new unannounced game, which was about to begin full production. It could very well line up with the aforementioned *Forbidden West*, but perhaps also with another IP. By October of the same year, Guerrilla [amassed](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-10-07-guerrilla-recruits-rainbow-six-siege-multiplayer-devs-for-unannounced-game) talent of *Rainbow Six: Siege* veterans, among them is director Simon Larouche, who previously worked on the universally acclaimed *Killzone 2* (2009). The obvious identity of that game might be a new *Killzone* game, but some rumors claim the game in question is a [revival](https://www.thegamer.com/rumor-guerilla-games-bring-socom-back/) of *SOCOM* (which otherwise is said to be developed by SIE San Diego).

&#x200B;

**Sucker Punch Productions**

Sucker Punch Productions just shipped its latest game *Ghost of Tsushima* so it seems like their next project is still years away. In comparison to some of Sony's other studios, it's a somewhat smaller team, with less than 200 employees. Either way, *Ghost of Tsushima*'s ridiculously high sales and positive reception prove they're not going anywhere.

* The most obvious candidate to Sucker Punch's next game would be a sequel to *Ghost of Tsushima*. There is little to say about it that is not speculation, but it is a very likely project to tackle after *Ghost of Tsushima* [sold](https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1286632240949219331) over 2.4 million copies in three days, becoming Sony's fastest-selling PS4 IP. It should be noted that the [Mongol invasion of Japan resumed in 1281](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_of_Japan#Second_invasion_(1281)), which could be used as the setting of a sequel.
* Elsewhere, Sucker Punch [renewing](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/07/infamous_domain_name_renewal_sparks_ps5_revival_hopes) the domain of the *InFamous* site sparked some speculation about the studio returning to its previous series.
* Finally, perhaps Sucker Punch will choose to expand on [*Prophecy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GCpolhOrsY)*,* the intriguing tech demo/unreleased game whose footage was leaked during July 2020 and was developed around 2014.

&#x200B;

**Polyphony Digital**

Sony's resident racing game studio, Polyphony Digital is dedicated to the *Gran Turismo* series. And this isn't going to change any time soon in my opinion. The studio's latest release was 2017's *Gran Turismo*, which despite being the lowest-rated title in the main franchise, was still a major commercial success and gradually received warmer reception as Polyphony added new content.

* [*Gran Turismo 7*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz-O74SmTSQ), obviously. Even before its official announcement, the game was heavily rumored and its logo was even [accidentally leaked](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/05/gran_turismo_7_ps5_leak_uses_mock_logo_circulated_online_says_source) back in May 2020. Current release date is unknown.

&#x200B;

**PixelOpus**

This is gonna be a brief one. PixelOpus is Sony's smallest internal studio, and to this date only shipped two games since its inception in 2014. The latest one was 2019's *Concrete Genie*, which got favorable reviews even if it wasn't a massive sales story. Whatever the studio is working on nowadays remains a mystery, as they finished support for their latest title.

&#x200B;

**Media Molecule**

Media Molecule is Sony's most unique studio in terms of its projects, aiming to push player creativity and interactions more than any other developer under its umbrella. After nearly a decade, the team finally released its latest project *Dreams* in February 2020 as yet another critically acclaimed platform for creators and designers.

* It feels obvious that Media Molecule will primarily focus on *Dreams* for a while, which in the past was said to be [designed for support for a decade and even more](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/01/sonys_shuhei_yoshida_describes_dreams_as_a_ten_year_project). They recently added VR support to the game and creative Mark Healey mentioned that a PlayStation 5 edition of *Dreams* is the ""[next big step](https://metro.co.uk/2020/02/14/dreams-will-playstation-5-not-pc-12239398/)"".
* It's currently unknown if Media Molecule is involved in some capacity in Sumo Digital's continuation of its *LittleBigPlanet* franchise, [*Sackboy: A Big Adventure*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUwI6e-em3o)*,* announced during the Future of Gaming event. It should be noted that the studio was involved in *LittleBigPlanet 3*'s early development, which was also primarily developed by Sumo Digital.

&#x200B;

**SIE Japan Studio**

SIE Japan Studio is Sony's biggest studio and its flagship development place. It is a wild card responsible for multiple games of different genres, styles and scope, and tends to collaborate with other developers just as much as it develops its own in-house productions. Some of its most notable games during the PS4 generation include *Gravity Rush 2*, *Astro Bot: Rescue Mission* and the *Knack* duology, as well as co-productions on *Bloodborne*, *The Last Guardian* and *Shadow of the Colossus* remake.

* Current *known* projects include [*Astro's Playroom*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu5VXrEqgco) (developed by ASOBI Team) as a pre-installed game for the PlayStation 5 and the **heavily** rumored [*Demon's Souls*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TMs2E6cms4) remake in co-production with Bluepoint Games, both were unveiled during the Future of Gaming event in June 2020. The former will serve as a presentation of the DualSense controller, and was [recently shown](https://dailygamingreport.co.uk/latest-gaming-news/dualsense-ps5-controller-showcased-by-sony/) by game presenter and gaming personality Geoff Keighley; the latter was [said to offer two performance modes](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/06/demons_souls_remake_on_ps5_is_real) based on fidelity or frame rate.  *Astro's Playroom* will launch with the PlayStation 5 during Holiday 2020; no release window for *Demon's Souls* has been provided.
* Due to the nature of this studio it's unknown what else they're working on aside from a few speculations and rumors. Back in January 2017, right around the release of *Gravity Rush 2*, creative director Keiichiro Toyama (*Silent Hill 1*, *Siren*, *Gravity Rush*) mentioned he'll begin a new project after *GR2*, while everyone's favorite smiling executive Shuhei Yoshida [mentioned](https://twitter.com/bk2128/status/818831611277950978) that SIE Japan is working on multiple games yet to be announced.
* The biggest rumor surrounding this studio is *Silent Hill*. The rumor apparently dates back to ResetEra, where user KatharsisT [claimed](https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-rebooting-silent-hill-series-update-maybe-%C2%AF-_-%E3%83%84-_-%C2%AF.174815/page-36#post-30901458) that a new game is in development with the aforementioned Toyama as well as series artist Masahiro Ito and series composer Akira Yamaoka, a claim which was apparently [verified](https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-rebooting-silent-hill-series-update-maybe-%C2%AF-_-%E3%83%84-_-%C2%AF.174815/page-37#post-30904935) by the mods there. A fellow 'insider'/'leaker'/whatever you like called Dusk Golem (who got himself caught in controversy recently but I'm sure the majority of you are aware of it) later [claimed](https://www.inverse.com/gaming/silent-hill-ps5-leaks-reboot-kojima) that it is internally developed by SIE Japan Studio as part of a licensing deal between Sony and Konami. Given Dusk's recent behavior, whether you want to continue to believe his addition to the rumors is up to you.
* While from the leaks it sounds like Toyama will be very busy for the coming years, he expressed his desire to make a third *Gravity Rush* game, though it will [likely wait](https://segmentnext.com/2017/01/18/gravity-rush-3-will-likely-wait-playstation-5-released/) for the now-announced PlayStation 5.
* In December 2017, SIE Japan was noted to have [trademarked](https://www.psu.com/news/sony-japan-trademarks-rayspace-ps4-revival-shooter-series/) something called *Ray Space*. What exactly this game is, is unknown. But apparently it's a [very ambitious science-fiction game](https://www.neogaf.com/threads/japan-studios-ambitious-new-aaa-ip-set-in-space-to-be-unveiled-at-ps5s-event.1544613/) with rumors and hints dating all the way back to 2014.

&#x200B;

**SIE Bend Studio**

After over a decade of working on handheld titles, Bend Studio finally returned to home console AAA development with 2019's *Days Gone*. It didn't get the rave reviews some other big Sony games got, but players absolutely loved it and the game proved to be a surprise hit with pretty solid sales for a new IP by a somewhat obscure team.

* *Days Gone* ended with a sequel hook, so it's likely that their next project would be a sequel. As of October 2019, the studio was already [working](https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2019/10/20/bend-studio-new-game-pre-production/) on pre-production of their next title and began recruiting new talent. By April 2020, the studio was still [recruiting](https://www.gamesradar.com/days-gone-studio-is-recruiting-for-a-new-aaa-game-likely-headed-to-ps5/) new talent for their next project.

&#x200B;

**SIE Santa Monica**

Santa Monica Studio stands as one of Sony's most acclaimed teams, and is responsible for *God of War*. After a very uncertain time between 2011 and 2016, including the disappointing results of 2013's *God of War: Ascension,* lay-offs and the cancellation of an ambitious sci-fi IP, the studio found its footing again with 2018's reimagined *God of War*, ushering a new dawn on the once-troubled studio.

* Let's get this out the way; a fifth *God of War* game is [inevitable](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2c/45/e5/2c45e573a882f3daf849b46e9381b1d0.png). The game has a few open plot threads and is ripe for an even grander sequel after the smashing success in reviews and sales. Hell, director Cory Barlog even said he has ideas for [five more games](https://bleedingcool.com/games/cory-barlog-plans-5-more-god-of-war-games/). Cory also suggested he would NOT direct the next game, and a [tweet](https://twitter.com/corybarlog/status/1212439831042617345) by him from January 2020 mentioned Eric Williams; is he gonna be the director of the next game?
* As for other projects, it's been hinted that an entirely new game is in works at SIE SM. Cory already mentioned that he pitched (couldn't find the original tweet, it's buried under two years of tweets and retweets) a new idea to Sony, and since then we've been given cryptic tweets and other hints about this mystery title. Film director Duncan Jones [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/1065052929160175616) about what's next for Barlog, and Barlog himself dropped some weird [tweet](https://twitter.com/corybarlog/status/1192467959882477569) that caused wild speculation. Either way, SIE SM apparently [assembles](https://www.gamepur.com/news/sony-santa-monica-studio-new-team-second-project) a second team.
* Finally, could SIE Santa Monica ever revive their high-profile, cancelled sci-fi game [*Internal 7*](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/ps4-game-internal-7-sony-16772900)? Santa Monica's canned PlayStation 4 exclusive was in development for about three years before [lay-offs hit the studio and Sony pulled the plug on the science-fiction game](https://www.giantbomb.com/sie-santa-monica-studio/3010-3664/forums/sony-santa-monica-hit-with-layoffs-cancels-new-ip-1473356/).

&#x200B;

**SIE London Studio**

SIE London primarily focuses on experiences revolving around the PlayStation brand's different applications and accessories. However, after years of being in the background, the studio got the spotlight upon delivering *Blood & Truth*, a VR shooter that shocked everyone thanks to its quality and production values.

* SIE London already began [recruiting](https://www.roadtovr.com/playstation-london-studio-already-working-next-vr-exclusive-possibly-psvr-2/) for a new project by late 2019. As with *Blood & Truth*, this title is likely to be VR-based. Given the way *Blood & Truth* sets itself up (see the pattern here?), a sequel is very likely to happen.

&#x200B;

**SIE San Diego Studio**

Like Polyphony Digital, San Diego is best known for doing one flagship series, *MLB: The Show*, though unlike the former San Diego Studio has ventured into other IPs in a more frequent rate.

* *MLB: The Show 21* is obviously coming in 2021, though the most interesting aspect about it thus far is that starting with this entry, all future *MLB* titles will be [multiplatform](https://www.gamesradar.com/mlb-the-show-multi-platform-nintendo-microsoft/) as a result of a new contract between Sony and the MLB association. So expect to see those future games on Xbox and likely the Switch as well.
* Also, remember that *SOCOM* title from Guerilla's part? There is some speculation that the actual developer of the title is not Guerrilla, but [San Diego Studio](https://youtu.be/hwG583BkenE?t=686). Given the studio's relatively recent [relocation](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/07/sony_san_diego_has_a_brand_new_office_and_logo) to a new building and a slight revamp to their logo, the studio might work on a new project separated from the *MLB* series; their last non-*MLB* games were released in 2017 as collaborations with third-party studios, so there is a notable gap here.

**Sony's Secret Studio in San Diego**

More or less an open secret by now, Sony [founded](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2018/04/sony_is_creating_a_new_game_development_team_in_san_diego) a new development studio in San Diego circa 2018, within the Visual Art Studio Group of Sony. And for the past two years, it's been recruiting talent from various places, including ex-Naughty Dog environment artist [Zack Oliver](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/07/sonys_not-so_secret_new_first-party_studio_adds_more_naughty_dog_talent) and *Red Dead Redemption 2* senior animator [James Martinchek](https://geekculture.co/red-dead-redemption-2-animator-leaves-rockstar-rejoins-sony-at-unnanounced-playstation-studio/), with senior game designer [Quentin Cobb](https://twitter.com/QTrainCobb/status/1001632180571795456) apparently leading the team.

* Their first game's identity is yet to be confirmed, though from what I've seen the chief speculation is an *Uncharted* continuation. The only things we know right now is that the game is probably a [third-person action/adventure game](https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2018/04/13/new-sony-development-team-to-work-with-major-sony-studio/) and will be in [collaboration](https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/assets/uploads/2018/04/New-Sony-Development-Team-PS4-Exclusive.jpg) with another Sony-owned studio.

# External Developers - Confirmed, Announced Games

With the exception of *Wild*, the following titles were announced during Sony's Future of Gaming event.

* *Demon's Souls* remake (TBC) - Bluepoint Games (*Shadow of the Colossus* remake) in collaboration with SIE Japan Studio (co-developer of the original game and the provider of the original pitch)
* *Sackboy: A Big Adventure* (TBC) - Sumo Digital (*LittleBigPlanet 3*): A successor to the *LittleBigPlanet* featuring protagonist Sackboy in a 3D platform style in contrast to the original series' focus on 2.5D levels. [Will include co-op mode](https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/sackboy-a-big-adventure-brings-co-op-platforming-to-ps5/).
* [*Destruction AllStars*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNO1k5NCDOk) (TBC) - Lucid Games (*Travel Bug*, *PlayStation Vita Pets: Puppy Parlour*): A vehicular combat video game with apparent focus on multiplayer. Trailer indicates arena fights in which the player can fight on foot in addition to using a vehicle.
* [*Returnal*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv4BjWoB-NA&t) (TBC) - Housemarque (*Super Stardust*, *Dead Nation*, *Resogun*, *Alienation*, *Matterfall*): A third-person shooter/survival-horror/rougelike title which features an astronaut on a hostile alien planet, stuck in a time loop that relapses every time she dies. The studio had a pretty rough time in recent years, with a [decision](https://housemarque.com/news/arcade-is-dead) to stray away from their traditional arcade shooters due to the genre's lackluster footnote in sales. The studio [announced](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2018/12/housemarque_is_working_on_an_unannounced_aaa_game) its plans to work on an AAA project and [licensed](https://housemarque.com/news/housemarque-licenses-unreal-engine-4-for-unannounced-new-title) the Unreal Engine 4 for the project, [putting its other project on hold](https://housemarque.com/news/2020/1/22/letter-to-fans-celebrating-25th-anniversary-in-2020). It will [make](https://www.vg247.com/2020/06/11/returnal-housemarque-ps5/) extensive use of the DualSense's features.
* [*Wild*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcSXWfG0Tp4) (TBC) - Wild Sheep Studio: Sony's ambitious yet uncertain survival game was [announced](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2014/08/gamescom_2014_ps4_exclusive_wild_looks_wacky_wonderful_and_erm_wild) all the way back to Gamescom 2014, but has been [missing](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/ps4-playstation-exclusive-wild-sony/) ever since. The latest we heard about the game was regarding some [old art resurfacing this year](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/04/wild_hopes_revived_as_concept_art_of_long_lost_ps4_exclusive_is_rediscovered) a few months ago. Whether the project has been scrapped or moved to PlayStation 5 is unknown at the time of this writing.

&#x200B;

# External Developers - Confirmed, Unannounced Games

* **Suppermassive Games**, best known for their development of the 2015 game *Until Dawn*, [mentioned](https://www.gematsu.com/2018/11/supermassive-games-working-on-several-unannounced-playstation-exclusives) that they are working on ""several"" unannounced PlayStation titles. [Don't expect a direct sequel to *Until Dawn*, though](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-there-is-no-until-dawn-2/1100-6466756/).

&#x200B;

# External Developers - Rumored Games & Other News

* **Impulse Gear**, developer of the VR shooter *Farpoint*, is [hiring](https://twitter.com/ImpulseGear/status/982078505826508801) for its next VR project, said to ""redefine AAA VR gaming"". Whether this new project is partnered with Sony as a publisher is unknown.
* **Kojima Productions** which developed 2019's *Death Stranding* has [secured enough funding](https://www.shacknews.com/article/118363/kojima-says-death-stranding-was-profitable-enough-to-fund-next-game-project) for their next project thanks to their first project's commercial performance, though a recent project has been [shafted](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/05/death_stranding_was_a_sales_success_recent_kojima_project_fell_through). Studio head and game director Hideo Kojima expressed his desire to work on a [horror game](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-would-like-to-make-a-revolutionary-horror-game/) after *Death Stranding*, and [was in talks](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/03/hideo_kojima_in_talks_with_norman_reedus_on_collaborating_again_for_future_projects) with actor Norman Reedus (previously collaborated on both the cancelled *Silent Hills* and *Death Stranding*) for a future project. Kojima also [expressed](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/10/hideo_kojima_wants_to_make_a_psvr_game_but_hes_not_free_enough_at_the_moment) that he wants to work on a VR game, but at the time of that statement he was not free enough to pursue that project. It's unknown if Kojima's next project will be partnered with Sony as publisher.

* While **Other Ocean Emeryville** shot down rumors about a remake of *MediEvil 2* (originally developed by the now-defunct Guerrilla Cambridge), the composer of the first game's 2019 remake [noted](https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2020/03/05/other-ocean-not-working-on-medievil-2-remake-medievil-projects/) that the game did well commercially. Whether it will manage to warrant a continuation remains unknown.
* **Sanzaru Games** [expressed](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/12/you_need_to_let_sony_know_if_you_want_more_sly_cooper) desire to work on a fifth *Sly Cooper* and finally resolve the cliffhanger of 2013's *Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time*, though they confirmed in December 2019 that they were not working on the project and said that fans should let Sony know they want another game. If a fifth game will ever get made, however, it won't longer come from Sanzaru, which was [acquired](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/02/facebook_kills_chances_of_sly_cooper_sequel_from_sanzaru_games_with_acquisition) by Facebook in February 2020.
* **Ready at Dawn** likewise [expressed](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-06-05-blizzards-paul-sams-joins-ready-at-dawn-as-new-ceo) their own desire to make a sequel for its 2015 polarizing game *The Order: 1886*. And just like Sanzaru, chances for a continuation by the developer are close to zero with the [acquisition](https://kotaku.com/facebook-buys-creators-of-the-order-1886-1844123560) by Facebook in June 2020. It should be noted that rumors about a sequel to *The Order* IP [formed](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/01/rumour_the_order_1886_will_make_a_triumphant_comeback_with_ps5_sequel) in January 2020. If such project indeed existed, its current situation is uncertain.
* **FromSoftware** president and creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki [said](https://www.gamesradar.com/im-not-the-one-to-decide-says-hidetaka-miyazaki-of-bloodborne-2/) back in late 2019 that his favorite game to work on was 2015's *Bloodborne*. However he also more or less [stated](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/10/souls_director_miyazaki_says_making_bloodborne_2_isnt_his_call) that *Bloodborne 2* has yet to be materialized and he is ""not the one to decide"" about its future. It should be noted that Miyazaki is currently busy with *Elden Ring*.

Beyond what's written here, there have been many, many rumors, speculations and other stuff about other Sony-related projects:

Rumors about Sony acquiring the likes of Kojima Productions or Remedy Entertainment (*Max Payne*, *Alan Wake*, *Control*). Rumors about an unannounced multiplayer-focused game by Remedy for the PlayStation 5. Rumors about *Bloodborne* and *Dreams* coming to PC alongside *God of War* and the *Uncharted* PS3 trilogy. Rumors about *Horizon Forbidden West* including a co-op mode. A fake 'leak' about *Spider-Man 2*'s plot and gameplay details. Rumors about Kojima making up with Konami to revive *Silent Hills*. Rumors about Sony acquiring Konami's top three IPs. Etc, etc.

I did like the [rumor about *Castlevania* getting a *Bloodborne*\-esque revival](https://www.inverse.com/gaming/ps5-rumor-castlevania-remake-bloodborne).

That's it for now. If you guys have any other substantial or reliable information to add to the post; some worthwhile rumors or leaks, don't hesitate to share so I can update, correct and improve this list.",1597754145.0

TLDR ( Thanks to [LocusAintBad](https://www.reddit.com/user/LocusAintBad/) )

1. Dev states he started working with Microsoft first and then Sony and said that Microsoft was difficult to work with.
2. Said that Microsoft doesn’t allow certain genres of games to be made because they don’t sell well.
3. Said the 4K rumor is pure bullshit and some devs have been playing with even 8K resolution.
4. SSD is about 60 times faster at loading than the 7200HDD.
5. Sony treat their devs better and allow them to go with their creative directions and support their decisions
6. Game he’s talking about should be out around October.
7. The new generation of consoles will be able to achieve new levels of AI with the extra power
8. “Expect space to become an issue on next gen consoles.” He says that games will be using more textures, more shading, bigger levels, higher resolutions and more intensive space taking features. (Yikes)
9. NDAs have made it a weird time for indie developers being unable to talk with each other like normally so they haven’t been able to share anything with other indie devs.
10. No studio is allowed to confirm or deny that they have a dev model or working PS5.
11. That backwards compatibility was officially announced vaguely so he wants to keep it vague with his answers but that unless “It’s a game that only one person has downloaded then I wouldn’t worry about not being able to play your current games on the PS5”
12. “From a devs perspective pre order a PS5 if you want the best players experience. You will regret getting a series X because Microsoft just doesn’t deliver that level of player experience” also says that “Maybe once a year you’ll see an Xbox game when you own a PlayStation and go wow I really wish I had that but on the Xbox it’s every few weeks or months that they have to see these quality exclusive titles and say wow I wish I had a PlayStation to play that”
13. When asked about pre orders he said he can’t disclose any information but that it would be wise to try to reserve a pre order now. He said that Curry’s, and Amazon UK are places you can reserve a pre order of the console as well as Best Buy, Walmart, and Amazon US if you live there and that even with the large amount of estimated systems being manufactured that Covid-19 has shut down some parts factories for 3+ months so that it would be wise to reserve a pre order.
14. The game he’s developing is Costume Kingdom and he says that as long as there is no licensing fees to upgrade the PS4 version to the PS5 then he doesn’t want to charge anyone for the upgrade. He said if it comes down to them needing to pay a licensing fee he’ll email the buyers of the game to let them know that’s what is happening.

/r/PS5/comments/gqwv1i/faq_v1/,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/gqwv1i/faq_v1/,F.A.Q. v1,258,1764,iBolt,"My first attempt at an F.A.Q. I did this especially since so many of us are a bit annoyed and salty about the many question posts repeating. With some constructive feedback I (or some else) can update this with additions/corrections.

**Q: Can I play my digital/disc based games from my PS4/PS3/PS2/PS1?**

A: According to Sony, the *overwhelming* majority of the 4000+ PS4 games will be playable on launch. PS4 games run from the HDD not the Disc, the disc just has the game files for installation. This means that there is no difference between a Disc/Digital game in terms of code, just the original source. Both also get the exact same updates.

[https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-majority-of-the-4000-ps4-titles-will-be-backwards-compatible-sony-says](https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-majority-of-the-4000-ps4-titles-will-be-backwards-compatible-sony-says)

Source:

[http://blog.us.playstation.com/2020/03/18/unveiling-new-details-of-playstation-5-hardware-technical-specs/](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2020/03/18/unveiling-new-details-of-playstation-5-hardware-technical-specs/)

You can play your PS4 titles from an external drive, so no need to use the internal (expanded) SSD from the PS5. Although games will probably load faster when you do.

Remastered PS1/PS2/PS3 games are  running on a PS4 and so should be counted as among the 4000+ games. So most of these games will work, if not all of them, just like the rest.

If they run on emulation, they might be more susceptible to issues running on the new hardware.

Only PS4 BC compatibility is confirmed. Disc based PS3/PS2/PS1 games have not been confirmed to be playable on the PS5. Sony hasn’t even mentioned any interest in this.

For games submitted by developers to Sony after 13th July 2020, Sony has mandated that in order to patch/remaster the game it has to run on PS5, according to [eurogamer.net](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-05-29-new-ps4-games-must-be-playstation-5-compatible-from-july-sony-tells-devs).

**Q: Can I play PS4 games with other PS4 players, while I'm playing it on the PS5?**

A: Yes, Sony has confirmed you can play PS4 games with others on PS4.

[https://twinfinite.net/2019/05/ps5-backward-compatibility-sony](https://twinfinite.net/2019/05/ps5-backward-compatibility-sony)

**Q:  Will PS4 games running on PS5 have the ability to run better or have better visuals on PS5?**

A: The BC modes are called legacy modes, and here your visuals will be the same as running the PS4 game on an actual PS4/Pro.

However running a PS4 game in PS5 native mode / boosted mode, can give you better frames, this can also cause unforeseen issues / bugs. However developers can update their games to run native on the PS5, allowing for higher resolutions, FPS and graphics. All up to the developers choice.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/gOySJQW](https://imgur.com/gallery/gOySJQW)

**Q: What about my saves and other account data from my PS4 account/PSN account and my PS Plus?**

A: There is no such thing as a PS4 account, there is however an PSN account (**P**lay**S**tation **N**etwork account), this is not tied to the PS4. This works for PS3 and Vita as well. This counts for your PS Plus subscription as well.

Your save data can be synced from the cloud using PS Plus. And since you  can already move your save data from a PS4 to another using an USB  drive, you can move your save data to your PS5 in the same manner.

**Q: How much will the PS5 cost and when will it come out?**

A: We do not know how much it will cost, most estimates are between $399 and $549, with the $499 being most likely considering the rumors about the production cost being around $450.

For comparison, the PS4 launched for $399, while the production costs was estimated at $381.

**Q: Should I wait with buying a PS5 because of:**

* **^(My PS4/Service)**
* **^(Possibility of a upcoming PS5 pro/slim)**
* **^(THe amount of PS5 games and/or games with actual next-gen graphics)**
* **^(Upcoming SKU’s like an 1TB 1.65TB model option?)**

A: If you’re asking this question, then yes, please wait. And give to all those without doubt a better chance getting a PS5 early.

In all fairness, there will be so much more info when the PS5 is released. Wait for that moment to be sure about it, it's still a lot of money.

**Q: Should I wait 6 months before buying the PS5 based on my launch date PS4 and PS3 breaking due to common faults in the first gen?**

A: Although earlier model products tend to have higher % issues compared to later models, this is usually not that big of a difference. And buying 6 months later gives no guarantees.

According to IGN only 1% of their users was affected by the launch issues of the PS4.

[https://www.ign.com/wikis/playstation-4/PS4\_Problems](https://www.ign.com/wikis/playstation-4/PS4_Problems)

I bought the PS3 when shortages were gone from physical stores, and I pre-ordered my PS4. Both still alive and kicking. My PS3 is being used by my brother in law. Anecdotal yes, and that can go both ways.

**Q: Should I wait for a PS5 or get a PS4 Pro now?**

A: Yes, you should wait.

The PS5 is a much better investment. Although the PS4 Pro is a good value, it can't play PS5 games and the PS5 can play PS4 games (and on PS4 Pro settings).

For the coming 2 years a lot of games will be releasing for both consoles. There will be PS5 exclusives though.

It will also not hold it's resell value as much, after the PS5 releases (and shortages are solved).

**Q: Should I wait with buying new games coming out for the PS4 and buy them on PS5?**

A: Since almost all titles will work with BC on the PS5 there is little reason not to buy them now.

If there is an update for the game to make it run native on the PS5, it most likely will be available for your PS4 copy as well. Especially first party titles. Cross-buy has been a thing on PlayStation for while now.

However, so far no guarantees.

When buying physical copies, the cases will look different is some way.

**Q: Will updates/installs still take such a long time?**

A: Updates/patches will no longer need to dreaded long ‘copying’.

The copying step is not necessary is because the SSD is not based on physical searching, unlike the HDD, which has an arm that reads the data from the disc that makes up the hard drive.

This copying step was made so that all the assets in a game file would be located in the same physical space instead of being scattered all around the drive, so that you reduce the number of searching steps and thus decreasing the time to find an asset.

Same thing happens when you use defragmentation on a HDD base computer.

However, we do not know the exact speed of the 4K Blu-ray drive, so we have no clue about the time it will take to install from disc.

In depth look on the PS5 SSD:

[https://www.tweaktown.com/news/71340/understanding-the-ps5s-ssd-deep-dive-into-next-gen-storage-tech/index.html](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/71340/understanding-the-ps5s-ssd-deep-dive-into-next-gen-storage-tech/index.html)

**Q: Is 825 GB enough for next gen game sizes?**

A: It's no longer necessary to duplicate game assets when using an SSD, especially one this fast. Although it would still have a performance benefit to do so.

The PS5's hardware decompressor uses Kraken vs ZLIB on the PS4, making the install sizes relatively smaller (somewhere between 10-20%). But we do not know how much more data will be used in next gen games with the higher graphics, this could mean sizes will be smaller, the same or even larger. Nobody is sure about this yet.

825GB will be a good minimum to start and there many options expansion for the future.

External drives are not fast enough to run PS5 games, but can be used to store games, for swapping between the internal and external drive.

Info on Kraken:

[http://www.radgametools.com/oodlekraken.htm](http://www.radgametools.com/oodlekraken.htm)

**Q: Can I expand this/use an external drive/ use my current external drive for my PS4?**

A: Yes, to all

There is an internal expansion port (M.2), but since there are no M.2 SSD’s fast enough out there yet, you have to wait with buying one. Because they are not fast enough and/or have the 6 priority levels the PS5 SSD has, you will need an SSD faster than the one Sony put in to compensate. Probably around 6.5 – 7 GB/s, Sony will give more information about this later this year.

You can use external drives to store PS5 games, for swapping between the internal and external drive. You can play your PS4 games from there as well. Your current PS4 external drive will be compatible with the PS5, whether you can just plug it in and play the already installed PS4 games on there is unknown.

**Q: Should I buy an M.2 SSD for the expansion slot now, or should I wait?**

A: Even though there is also an internal expansion port (M.2) don't buy a M.2 SSD just yet. DO note that prices of storage costs, especially SSD's go down over time.

In depth look on the PS5 SSD:

[https://www.tweaktown.com/news/71340/understanding-the-ps5s-ssd-deep-dive-into-next-gen-storage-tech/index.html](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/71340/understanding-the-ps5s-ssd-deep-dive-into-next-gen-storage-tech/index.html)

**Q: Why is the storage size of the SSD it that weird number (825GB)?**

A: To optimize price vs performance, they used 1 chip for each of the 12 channels it has. So 12 times 512Gbit (chip size) equals 6144Gbit, and that divided by 8 (bits to bytes) equals 768GiB which equals 825GB (824.6GB).

Info on Gigabytes:

[https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Difference-between-GiB-and-GB](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Difference-between-GiB-and-GB)

**Q: Will next gen games run on 30/60/120/Variable FPS on 1080p/1440p/2160p or have options/choices between them?**

A: Yes.

This is up to the developers, as it was with the current generation for 30/60 FPS. We have had games run on 30 and 60 FPS, or “unlocked” FPS. The latter allowed games to run faster than 30 FPS with not at a constant 60, this has a downside on the smoothness feeling of the game.

A lot of gamers are expecting that there will be little to no change to the relative amount of games running on 30 FPS. Or how many games will give you a choice between FPS and resolution.

**Q: Will the PS5 support 21:9/Ultrawide?**

A: Nothing is known about support for 21:9.Ultrawide, this would also be up to developers to implement. Hopefully more info on this will be available after the PS5 is fully revealed.

**Q: Do I need a 4k tv to play on ps5?**

A: No.

Although games will probably look a lot better on most 4K TV's then on most 1080p TV's, there is no 4K requirement. Features like HDR also make games look a lot better.

A lot of gamers actually hope most games will give a 2-4x FPS option on 1080p. So in some cases a 120Hz 1080p could be a better option, depending on your budget.

**Q: What is HDMI 2.1 and do I need it for PS5?**

A: It's a newer version of HDMI, but this is not a requirement for the PS5. So you do not need it.

Consider when buying a TV with HDMI2.1 support what features it truly supports and in what way. Look on the internet or TV related subreddits for more info.

Notable features of HDMI 2.1

* Has more bandwidth then 2.0,  48Gbps vs 18Gbps
* Can do 4K resolution at 120 FPS, while 2.0 can only do 4K at 60 FPS
* Supports VRR (**V**ariable **R**efresh **R**ate), similar to [Gsync](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-g-sync/)/[Freesync](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-freesync/).
* Supports something called Dynamic HDR.
* Features eARC, a more robust version of Audio Return Channel
* Is backward-compatible with older technology, so if you have an older set that doesn't support the new version, HDMI 2.1 will still work with it.

You will need an HDMI 2.1 cable to take advantage of the new features.

A: The PS5 will supports 4K Blu-Ray, but so far there is no information on Dolby Atmos.

[https://developer.dolby.com/platforms/consoles/overview/#](https://developer.dolby.com/platforms/consoles/overview/#)!

**Q: Will the PS5 support Mouse and Keyboard / Gyro assisted aiming?**

A: The PS3 and PS4 support Mouse and Keyboard and Gyro assisted aiming. Whether developers support this in their game is up to them.

**Q: Will the PS5 support my current accessories (steering wheel, headphones etc.)?**

A: We only know so far that PSVR (so also move and aim controllers)are supported, and for PSVR the DualShock 4 is required\*.

^(\*The DualSense cannot be tracked by the camera used for PSVR.)

**Q: What games have been confirmed for PS5 so far?**

A: As of 27th May 2020:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/grdv7x/games\_confirmed\_for\_the\_ps5\_from\_the\_newest\_issue/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/grdv7x/games_confirmed_for_the_ps5_from_the_newest_issue/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

**Isn’t the Xbox Series X/PS5 way more powerful than PS5/Xbox Series X?**

A: No.

Although we understand quite a bit of the hardware/software engineering of consoles, it is hard to be accurate at this point. Regardless of power, we have seen in the past that even the most powerful console can underperform due to lack of optimization.

Yes the GPU of the Xbox Series X has more CU’s and more TFLOPS, a slightly higher clock speeds for the CPU and mostly higher bandwidth memory. The PS5 has a better Storage to memory Architecture and SSD, 3D audio chip and higher clock speeds of the GPU. Nobody is sure how this will play out, but all the differences aren’t gigantic between the 2 consoles.

If you want to know more, please search the internet/reddit for the already ongoing en plentiful discussions going on about this topic.

**Q: Is it true the PS5 / PS5 SSD is more powerful than any PC hardware?**

A: The PS5 all round, no not really. The SSD is unique but the term powerful can mean many things.

The SSD is unique that it has 6 priority levels, other than that it’s a PCIE 4.0 M.2 SSD with 5.5 GB/s. PC’s however have the option, to buy expensive 15 to 24 GB/s SSD’s or set up multiple SSD's in RAID (way to combine the speed and storage of 2 or more drives). Although these do not have 6 priority levels, their speed alone will probably makes up for that.

The PS5 does have a unique storage to memory architecture (I/O) design. Which has dedicated hardware for many (heavy) CPU related tasks like decompression. For now, and this is temporary, there isn’t an equivalent for PC. But for now the same goes for any game taking full advantage of this. And consider, when the Sky is the limit, a PC can compensate a lot with 32GB VRAM, 1TB RAM 32core (or higher) CPU’s.

Consoles and PC's are very different beasts. Consoles have great value with impressive performance for the expected price point. PC's are more versatile in price point use and their ability to upgrade/expand.

**Q: Will the PS5 be loud / sound like a jet engine when under load?**

A: No.

The PS4 is loud, especially under load. This wasn't addressed with the PS4 Pro initially but they did update that model as well to be more quiet.

However, Cerny (the lead designer for PlayStation consoles) addressed this in his ""Road to PS5"" talk originally scheduled for GDC (Game Developers Conference).

There he stated that the PS5 cooling system will be a lot quieter.

* This news finally allows Sony to not only reveal their prices but also pressure them into becoming more aggressive with marketing material and sharing new info, something we all have longed for.

# Benefits it offers for us

* Xbox has definitely made a very powerful move on their part by putting out a cheaper console with less power but still allow players to play next gen games. Price is an important factor that drives a customer when making a purchase.
* However, it's unlikely Xbox will be able to sway any existing PS users over to Xbox due to the tight and lucrative eco system Sony has built with their exclusives and other Third party exclusive deals.
* That being said an unseasoned gamer who walks into a store without having already decided what he's gonna buy could easily be swayed by the cheaper price point; all he needs to know is if the console can play the latest games releasing.
* Sony is well aware of this particular customer base as well because of which they will definitely undercut the Series X, at least with their all digital edition.
* If I were to make an educated guess I'd say we could easily see PS5 Digital Edition at $399 and the Disc drive Edition at 499$ matching the price of the Series X, Sony could become even more aggressive and undercut the Series X with the Disc Edition by a smaller Margin.
* **Edit 2** : Adding this as there seems to be some confusion, PS5's competitor remains the series X and will hence attempt to undercut the Series X only. There's no Price competition with the Series S whatsoever considering the vast difference in their hardware capabilities.
* However, Series S will have an indirect influence on the Pricing of the PS5 as both companies are aware it helps to have a product on the lower end of the price spectrum. PS5 DE will be the Primary contender to challenge the Price of the Series X and maybe even entice Series S buyers to spend extra and gain access to PS exclusives along with the more powerful Hardware.

# To sum it up

* We can pretty much throw the whole $600 dollar thing out the window at this point, no matter the capabilities and games of a console, Price matters. It may not matter to you and I who are set on playing the exclusives at any cost but it matters to the average customer.
* Xbox has made sure we get a fair price on the PS5 and also allowed Sony to share more info with us which I'm sure we'll see a plethora of in the upcoming weeks.",1599563761.0

These days however thats simply not the case if you choose to educate yourself.

Day by day MTX are becoming the norm kids born only a few years ago completely take this as normal. With MTX being more normal today this goes without saying they make companies alot of money.

No matter how badly some of us hate them MTX make companies billions upon billions every year.

There is no need to add another 10 bucks on to a sports game that comes out every single freaking year. The game should be FTP due to how much money these games make the companies.

These companies dont pay their taxes, They crunch to overwhelmingly harmful degrees also they will fire workers despite making record breaking revenue BLIZZARD!!!! Their games dont need to be 60 bucks not even 70 hell no.

Its pure greed at this point they want every single penny.

If 70 bucks is the new norm then I for one wont be picking games up day 1 anymore. I havent pre ordered in years but this is just silly.

Yearly sports games shouldnt cost 70 bucks they come out every year with so little work done.

Knack, killzone and driveclub with a load of cross generation stuff thrown in. Yes we knew an uncharted sequel was coming but it wasn't until 2015/16 when the heavy hitters started getting shown. Compare that to what we already know about the PS5. A new ratchet and clank which is arguably Sonys biggest family friendly IP. A sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn, one of the most beloved exclusives of the current generation. A continuation of the critically acclaimed Spider-Man game from insomniac, and while not a full blown sequel it still looks promising. A brand new mainline entry in the Gran Turismo series which is a bit niche but for people into car stuff they're gonna love it. A plethora of great indie titles like Kena, Little devil inside, oddworld, stray etc. 2 timed exclusive Bethesda games from tango game works and arcane. A remake of the critical darling Demons Souls. Not to mention more and more titles are coming out and saying if you buy the current gen version you get the next gen version for free.

Edit: I didn't know about UC4 as i havent played its multiplayer. Plus kudos to Nintendo too.

Edit2: I see a lot of people saying that its because Sony does single player thats why there are no MTs etc. Well assassin's creed odyssey has some of the worst microtransactions and its single player only, Shadow of war was so bad in terms of MTs, that developer had to remove them, Deus Ex mankind divided again had really bad MTs. So truth is that there are many single player offline games that push MTs. Ubisoft or EA would have added 100s of MTs in horizon zero dawn or ghost of tsushima. 

Also a thing to note is that Sony doesn't force its devs to add MTs, that deserves applause, why? Simply because its easy money and everyone does it. Sony is one of the last bastions of pro-gamer models. ",1595930602.0

Here's hoping the guys and girls that make these amazing products for us all get a little more respect and looking after.

However it appears to have touched a nerve and brought out a combination of excellent insight in to the gaming industry as well as a lack of hope for anything to ever change.  

This is a shame. I say this as collectively, us humans have been able to make dramatic positive changes in many ways. Especially over the last few hundred years.   

Regardless of your opinion, I'd like to thank the 99% that kept it civil, those that moderate this sub for allowing this post to live as it really is slightly off subject, and all those people that gave an award to this post.

As far as I'm concerned, the awards go to all those that work tirelessly on the games we love so much.  The awards are for those that suffer the negative aspects of the industry. I'm sure it's not something that affects everyone and every company and we're grateful to the employers that make the effort.

Thank you every single developer that ever made a game regardless of how well it did. You're all fucking legends. 

I've lost count of the times I've read about how ""this game saved my life""... 

You guys do this.

I literally cannot wait for the next gen, regardless of what platform you play on.

That already beats RTX IO which caught everyone by surprise when Nvidia unveiled the new RTX 3000 cards and PS5 once again dusts the PC space with its insane speeds. 

Though Mark Cerny in the Road to PS5 presentation did state that the PS5 has a theoretical max of 22 GB/s which a lot of people seem to have overlooked. With Mark Cerny’s efforts developers will be able to truly meet their vision in games for next generation. Mark Cerny is truly an amazing console architect and imho one of Sony’s most valuable assets.

I just wanted to shed some more light on this because I don’t think a lot of people realize just how fast this is.

I appreciate your time. Thanks.

Edit: I’m genuinely shocked at the response from everyone! I promise to get around to replying to everyone after I’m off work. Thank you!!! And just to clarify, I’ve never owned a PlayStation so your recommendations are wonderful.
