e9xirg,therealtinnyhippo,"Some extra info, courtesy of this official Microsoft announcement:

Yes, the box can sit both vertically and horizontally

The controller is technically new. Microsoft say “Its size and shape have been refined to accommodate an even wider range of people, and it also features a new Share button to make capturing screenshots and game clips simple and an advanced d-pad derived from the Xbox Elite Series 2 Wireless Controller. The new Xbox Wireless Controller will be compatible with Xbox One and Windows 10 PCs, and will be included with every Xbox Series X.

It’ll support 60fps at 4K, “with possibility of up to 120FPS”, and will also support 8K visuals.

The Xbox Series X has a “next-generation SSD will virtually eliminate load times.”

It’s backwards compatible! Across all previous Xboxes! “Thanks to backward compatibility, you can expect your gaming legacy, thousands of your favorite games across four generations of gaming, all your Xbox One gaming accessories, and industry-leading services like Xbox Game Pass to be available when you power on your Xbox Series X in Holiday 2020.”",2348,1576209262.0,/r/xboxone/comments/e9xirg/xbox_series_x_world_premier_4k_trailer/

- The PS3 (giant enemy crab, 599 US dollars, PS3 has no games, etc.). Lead to them focusing on their first party studios and eventually course correcting to the PS4 for easier development.

ibeimy,SilverseeLives,"This, precisely.

Sony is still pushing exclusives to sell you new hardware, which is why they will ""win"" the console wars (again).  And also why it won't matter. Sony will sell tens of millions of PlayStations, while Xbox Game Pass could reach hundreds of millions of users, most of whom won't need Xbox consoles. 

This is a major difference in scale. It's not obvious to everyone right now, but if I was a third-party game developer, I know which ""platform"" I would want to target my games for first. Remember that XCloud is hosted on *physical Xbox hardware*, so game developers will be highly incented to continue to build and optimize for Xbox consoles, regardless of how many more PlayStations are sold to end users at retail. 

If I sound like a ""console warrior"" I'm really not; I have owned a PS3, have PS4 Pro, and will pick up the PS5 too. I just dislike the endless anti-Xbox narratives that permeate the gaming community.

Microsoft deserves credit for letting us play games wherever and however we want.

ibeimy,MankyBaws88,"I get you said that ""game pass could reach hundreds of millions of users"", and that's a fairly reasonable thing to say considering how many smartphones/PCs/Xboxes there are out there, but I honestly think that the number of people who would pick up a controller to use game pass with their phone is being totally inflated in these arguments. This could and might just be me, but there is nothing on earth that would make me think ""you know what, I'll definitely enjoy this game on my 6"" phone screen"". 

I think Microsoft are obviously trying to switch up their strategy and carve out a space for themselves, which whether I like it or not is cool and absolutely their decision to make. For what it's worth I think they'll succeed in whatever their goal is for it. I just can't see how it leads to better games. 

I've had game pass pretty much since day one, and yeah it's a good thing, but it's being pushed as this massive shift in how we consume our games and if you're not on board with the ""value"" then you're a fucking idiot. To me game pass is absolutely worth the money as an accompaniment to buying games. It probably wouldn't ever replace the 8-10 AAA games I'd conservatively estimate I buy a year, and all I seem to see is, "" yeah but think about it, you spend £60 a game for 10 games and you can get ALL OF THIS for the cost of 2 games a year"". Realistically though it just adds the cost of 2 games a year on to what I already buy, since most of the bigger games aren't on there anyway. I don't think personally it's as ""pro consumer"" as everyone seems to be saying, and as someone who has owned every Xbox console since the OG and loved them, they've kinda lost me with this. 

I was hoping beyond hope that finally the money would be put behind absolute top quality first party games, rather than a library of ""free"" AAs and indies that are mostly not for me, and the occasional AAA 2 years after launch. Even the first parties they showed so far seem to be mostly more of the same 6-7/10 stuff we've seen. Obviously this gets downvoted and I'll be accused of being a Sony fanboy, but from someone who has been with Xbox since the beginning and currently has a One X, why wouldn't I just get a PS5 now if Microsoft aren't interested in selling me a console? 

Lastly, the ""console wars"" are stupid and this isn't in any way intended as anti-Xbox or pro-PlayStation. It's just an opinion from someone who loves video games and happily plays them on Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch.

Edit: Sorry guys I forgot that nobody can disagree with anything Microsoft does. I'll make sure to just post ""OMG Game Pass is truly amazing"" next time.",65,1597677141.0,/r/xboxone/comments/ibeimy/if_selling_more_consoles_than_sony_and_nintendo/

Nintendo subs do too, but sometimes they're completely off base, like trying to downplay massive successes like Pokemon because they don't personally appeal to them anymore.

The Sony subs are just 24/7 propaganda and rhetoric. Idk if it's because the PS4 is just so much more popular than Xbox One that those subs pull in the absolute lowest of society into them or what, but it's bad. The problem is the good conversations and users are drowned out by the fanboys.

For example, I can say that I absolutely think Bloodborne and GoW are two 10/10 games and the best of the generation, but if I said I found both Horizon and Spiderman to be overrated and too samey, I'm immediately labeled a fanboy. You can't criticize anything Sony, because it's just a unwritten rule. 

I could go into detail about how I feel Gears and Halo have been deteriorating as series over the years, and while it would likely have a mixed reaction, I would get some real, legitimate discussion going.

The thing I like about the PC gaming community is that while they want you to just play on PC, and will judge you if you don't, they're willing to shit on and criticize any game, service, company or product when it is appropriate.

To me, the Sony community has always been a problem, and Sony's attitude at time does nothing to inhibit it, unfortunately.

Xbox has stronger hardware specs. It just does. There isn't really any way to argue this without going into crazy edge cases and hypotheticals (which people eagerly do).

EDIT: I really didn't expect this to blow up this way, thank you kind redditors for these awards (though I don't know what to do with that xD). Now, for some comments around here:

- I don't think it's even remotely fair to say that it's very possible because of what happened with the 360, taking into account the 14 years of experience that separate them. Nevertheless, of course you never know, but to suspect it this aggressively at this point, it feels shady.
- It's easy to draw conclusions when it fits your narrative, but the best way to approach the truth is to study the subject. Get some info on how hardware works, how the system is built, and you'll probably change your mind one way or another, just don't spread rumours without the necessary understanding.
- Yes, it's also possible that PS5 might have some problems as well, but I won't play that game from neither side. 
- Apparently the one who started this bs works for a media strongly sponsored by Sony, again it could be only because of pure ignorance, but at this point, given what I've seen on the internet, I expect nothing and am disappointed anyway.
- I really have no knowledge about this guy or The Verge, I just saw it on my timeline and found it to be a good abstract.

j6fq03,Steakpiegravy,"Microsoft is so proud of their console being reliable they had no issues sending it to hundreds of influencers. They just didn't count on some of them being so ignorant about hardware that they would be creating these stupid rumours likely before speaking to Microsoft.  

I just don't understand what they were thinking. Before they went online to do this, they should have spoken with Microsoft about it. They would have explained it's normal and likely also why - the console has the highest clocked CPU in a console to date at 3.8GHz and a GPU clock at 1.8GHz that only the PS5 has higher at 2.23GHz. 

Therefore, it shouldn't be surprising for really hot air to come out of Series X, because that means the cooling system is doing its job and not keeping the heat inside. The most impressive thing about it is that the console does this with a single fan and is incredibly quiet while doing so.

Up to this point consoles had mechanical hard drives and PC had mostly SSD, but in different flavours (SATA/NVME). It's not that uncommon to see a PC with a small NVME disk for OS and important apps and a large SATA SSD for games. Also laptops often comes with 1x M.2 slot and 1x SATA port.

Does it mean PC games made with next-gen in mind will now specify a required disk speed? And who will measure it? That will be a real problem since SSD manufacturers like to promote their disks with the phrases like ""transfer up to XXXXMB/s"" and this may mislead some customers.

hlud9a,Scarmander,"Hey guys! After my last post, I thought that was fun, but after reading your feedback I decided I could give it another shot. I wanted something easy to navigate, that showcases the main background easily. I wanted quick access to games, and a news feed tailored to my decisions and my notifications. Lastly, I don't like the Content Blocks Xbox has now, but the idea is sound. I changed it to a widget based approach, where buttons are contextual depending on the widget you select. For example, we can see in Content, when I select the Music widget the X button says Play Music. I'll give an explanation of each page below for those interested.

**Home**

7 Pinned apps, and acts as the hub of your console. It's main goal is to get you to the apps you use the most fastest, while showcasing your background for those who want that.

**Library**

A group-based list of content consisting of Suggested (what the Console thinks you'll play given your trends), and an interchangeable Content Block. In the gif, it is on Games, but by changing to the next group, you can swap to your Subscriptions, Apps, Games, Queue, etc. I wanted the Library to be directly underneath the Home in case what you want isn't in your pins. Like my previous post, I didn't want my library to be an app. This is the most important thing for Xbox Users, it should load fast.

**News**

I read reddit a lot for the latest news about games, but apps like Google News, or Apple News already track this and cater any news that matches to me. I thought it would be valuable to have a News section catered to what I like, and feed me with updates such as new trailers, Gamepass additions or game updates. However, I placed the top right content to be a direct feed from Xbox and your notifications (Messages, Party Invites, etc.).

**Content**

Poor name I know, I couldn't think of anything else. The idea for Content is to change Xbox's Content Blocks into Widgets like the Windows 10 start screen. Pick a concept, select your size and place into a screen. Examples such as music, next achievements, leaderboards, or even your Xbox Gold Seniority Badge can all be displayed (I think it should have always been more visible!). This page is meant to be completely customize-able to give you content fast. I also added concepts that are new to Xbox such as Calendar, and Weather.

**Tl-dr:** I made a dashboard with the goal of quick access/information, less clutter, and the ability to see your background in full.

EDIT: This blew up way more than my last post, so many thanks guys! I'm glad you like it! A lot of you are mentioning the background moving when the page changes. I 1000% agree, sadly it's a limitation in the way I built the concept.

1. The icons at the bottom only show the title if you hover over them. I can't tell what most of those games are by the tiny cover art image alone.

2. Am I supposed to just *know* what is to the left or to the right? There is no primary breadcrumb to denote which page I am currently on and where I will be if I navigate in either direction.

3. Where is the store? How can I purchase new games?

4. Where are my apps? Why do my games have a huge page dedicated but the ""media and apps"" have a tiny square stuffed with a bunch of other content?

5. Who cares about news? What even is that tab and how does it determine which news to display? Where do those articles go? Does it try to aggregate outside sources? That is asking for trouble.

6. And lastly... why is the home screen just a direct copy of an iPad?

1. You're right more detail could be added. To play devil's advocate, all these apps/games would have been purchased, so there shouldn't be many surprises in your library.
2. This is intended, I wanted to trust the user learn, rather than add clutter. It seems fair due to the dashboard having 3 additional pages. Similar examples can be seen with Android and iOS, but I understand this will be subjective.
3. The store is an app. You can see it pinned in the home screen. A deals widget in the Content section would be interesting though.

flukqt,Tobimacoss,"It kinda has to do with the way playstation games are built.  They are built more closer to the metal, so the backwards compatibility needs to create a virtualized hardware replica of the older hardware, fooling the games into thinking they are still running on old hardware.  Problem is, the ps5 SSD is too fast for those old games, no way to reduce SSD speeds unlike downclocking CPU and GPU to match PS4 hardware.  So not all games will work out of box or will have glitches, that's why Sony is testing them starting with top 100.

Xbox and PC games use a hardware abstraction layer with DirectX, so they aren't dependant upon the flaws and intricacies of certain hardware.  This is because MS has to support hundreds of thousands of hardware combinations.  So the Xbox games are much more easily virtualized/emulated, and can be enhanced and improved upon.  And DX12 can still get closer to the metal but still provide abstraction.  

There's advantages to doing things both ways.  With Sony's approach, the devs can extract more juice out of weaker hardware, if they are skilled enough.   Like you saw with Naughty Dog and Last of Us.  With MS approach, it ensures backwards compatibility for long term game preservation, and much easier to develop and optimize for the thousands of combinations of hardware.  

It's like the Apple macOS vs Windows or iOS vs Android approach.  Apple only has to optimize for few sets of hardware while windows and android have to deal with thousands of sets.  The DX12 approach is much more superior long-term imo as it is more easier to scale across best PC rigs to base Xbox.  And you know your old games will always work and even look better.  The games aren't tied to certain hardware, aka Abstraction.  The 360 was a more tougher situation because the games were compiled for a RISC Power PC architecture.  Had the 360 been x86, we would've had even more BC titles.  So MS can easily guarantee every Xbox one game will work on Series X, but Sony can't guarantee that every PS4 games will work on ps5 back compatibility mode, so they are taking things slow.",187,1584732996.0,/r/xboxone/comments/flukqt/unlike_ps5_xbox_series_x_will_support_all_xbox/

flukqt,HawkMan79,"The thing is. The PS4 and PS5 are both x86-64 the hardware on the PS5 should be able to run all ps4 games no problem. 

The difference between MS and Sony is that MS has a lot of experience with OS and software design and build the console on top of a very modular and established OS that already has a standardized platform.  Meanwhile Sony is stumbling around custom designing the OS for each new platform losing direct compatibility because it’s not using a modular platform and kernel. The PS4 pro was basically a faster PS4 so it just ran the same OS with no new special designs custom designed directly into the kernel for new custom hardware.",83,1584735232.0,/r/xboxone/comments/flukqt/unlike_ps5_xbox_series_x_will_support_all_xbox/

flukqt,Tbeckmanly,"This isn’t exactly correct. 

What was said (paraphrasing) is that they tested the top 100 games (by play time) and the majority of them worked as expected. They have to test each game (although I imagine there will be ones they just don’t — old sports titles etc) to make sure it will work, and it won’t be 100%. 

That doesn’t mean only the Top 100 will be playable, it could mean significantly less (whatever Sony considered majority ex. 60/100 games), it also leaves open the possibility of many more than 100 depending on how long it takes to verify each game. 

In any case, the PS5 will most likely have a satisfactory back catalog of games to help supplement the launch.",53,1584726252.0,/r/xboxone/comments/flukqt/unlike_ps5_xbox_series_x_will_support_all_xbox/

j2f6ce,BeastMaster0844,"Amazing. I actually “bought” it within the first year of its release. It was free from GameFly because I used two of my $5 off coupons that they give you for being a member and the game was only $8. I didn’t like it. I couldn’t get in to it and ended up trading in the game to Gamestop for like $10. However, over the last 2 weeks I decided to give it another shot and I’m hooked now. Been playing it none stop and even subscribed to ESO. 

So far I’ve made 5 different characters to try out the different classes and the amazing thing is that from the very beginning of the game you can go where ever you want begin questing wherever. There’s no leveled zone because the levels scale to you. 

So out of each character, all progressed through the same levels, each one was in a completely different looking and feeling region and doing completely different different quest lines that were nothing like each other. 

The quest are amazing and not your typical MMO KILL 10 RATS quest. They’re well written, full of twist, and everything has amazing voice acting too. 

The world is massive. The scale of everything is just .. big. The size of the map is multiple times larger than all previous Elder Scrolls games combined and there’s actually other players constantly questing. Plus the map doesn’t feel empty. There’s a lot of lore, NPCs, and stuff around to catch interest. NPCs will talk to each other, have conversations about a quest you completed earlier and mention the dialog option you chose during the quest, or they’ll give hints about a location you haven’t discovered yet. It’s pretty immersive. 

The combat is okay. Each class plays very differently and each weapon has its own skill line. So there’s a lot of skills. However, it’s Elder Scrolls combat. It doesn’t look good (in 3rd person). It looks like Elder Scrolls combat. If you played Skyrim then you’ll recognize the combat. 

It’s worth a try. I’m actually about to boot it up right now. I got up 2 hours early for work so I can play some before I have to start my day.",73,1601455667.0,/r/xboxone/comments/j2f6ce/in_case_you_missed_it_the_elder_scrolls_online/

They fumbled this for way too long that they can radically changed these titles and people will welcome it. I know a lot of people liked the Fable series, personally the first one was really the only good one for me. 

Same can be said about Perfect Dark. Zero was terrible. Hopefully these games come with a fresh perspective. Microsoft has a lot of interesting IPs, they need a creative team with full freedoms to bring them back to life. 

I hope Fable takes inspiration from all the current classics we were able to play this generation.",304,1589147153.0,/r/xboxone/comments/gh9dse/fable_needs_to_be_the_xbox_series_xs_breath_of/

1. Don't make it ""hard"" medieval, that setting has been done to death with RPGs.

2. Maintain the whimsical atmosphere and Monty Python-esque charm that the series is known for. I'm not against having darker moments like arriving at Aurora in III, but making it grimdark like the Witcher would clash too much with the other games.

3. Keep the interactivity with the NPCs and the economy, those helped the old games stand out.

They're both franchises that have name recognition but don't have legions of rabid fans that would be pissed if they dramatically change them.

Sure, Sean Murray filled his shoes for overhyping No Man’s Sky, but he has since made it the game it should have been.  But I don’t think we’ve had a replacement or successor for Molyneux rise up and take that spot, or at least I can’t think of anyone off-hand.  Ken Levine is gone (Thief, System Shock, BioShock).  CliffyB (Unreal, ~~God~~ Gears of War) has been shaky at best lately.  Sid Meier’s sim games are still going strong but I wouldn’t call them visionary.  Gabe Newall might be back in the running since they finally released a new Half Life entry.  John Carmack (Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein) maybe, now that he’s spearheading VR?  Maybe Hideo Kojima?  Death Stranding was definitely something unlike anything that came before it, and the Metal Gear games are a solid legacy (no pun intended).

They aren't enjoyable to fight against. Their lore is overly obtuse and convoluted. After playing through both Halo 4 and 5, I had to read a bunch of wiki articles in an attempt to even understand who the Prometheans are and why I'm fighting against them.

Their deign language is SOOOO boring and generic. Every enemy is just this angular, metallic space robot. Their weapons all blend in with their silhouettes, making it hard to identify them before combat begins and they all shoot the same orange ""hard light"" goo.

In comparison, the Covenant was such an interesting, eclectic mix of various enemy species. Elites, jackals, hunters, grunts, etc. all had very unique physical designs with various personalities and weapon types.

Infinite desperately needs that sort of uniqueness again.

* ""We are incredibly excited to show many of the new games in development for Xbox Series X soon.""
* ""I clearly remember that first magical experience of jumping into one of my favorite Xbox 360 games, *Final Fantasy XIII*, and instantly resuming where I had left off years before as if no time had passed at all.""
* ""We were able to go back even further into the archives and resurrect some of your favorite franchises from the original Xbox.""
* ""Thousands of games are already playable on Xbox Series X today, from the biggest blockbusters to cult classics and fan favorites.""
* ""Backwards compatible games run natively on the Xbox Series X hardware, running with the full power of the CPU, GPU, and the SSD. No boost mode, no downclocking, the full power of the Xbox Series X for each and every backward compatible game.""
* ""Backwards compatible titles also see significant reductions in in-game load times from the massive leap in performance from our custom NVME SSD.""
* ""Xbox Series X delivers a new, innovative HDR reconstruction technique that enables the platform to automatically add HDR support to games. We can also apply it to Xbox 360 and original Xbox titles developed almost 20 years ago, well before the existence of HDR.""
* ""In addition, the new Quick Resume feature was designed to not only work with new games, but it can also be enabled for backward-compatible titles.""
* ""Techniques such as the Heutchy method, which enables titles to render with increased resolutions up to 4K, or applying anisotropic filtering to improve the final image quality bring these classic games up to modern standards, better than ever before.""
* ""We are also creating whole new classes of innovations including the ability to double the frame rate of a select set of titles from 30 fps to 60 fps or 60 fps to 120 fps.""

5dj0bx,Yung2112,"I always like to do a reccomendation comment for these kinds of sales so here I go!:

- AC: Syndicate. Best AC of the generation, beautiful london setting. Totally worth $20
- Battlefield 1: There's nothing to say about this game that hasn't been said already. GRAB IT! It'll be $27 at walmart in a week tho, so if you want to go physical that's a great option
- Borderlands: The Handsome Collection. A LOT of content for $20. Both are fantastic for CO-OP too
- Dragon Age: Inquisition GOTY. Yet another REALLY long game+ DLCs for a very reasonable price. It's no witcher 3 but damn, I really liked it
- Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Every xbox gamer should've lived the story of master chief, 4 campaigns for $15 and a, while somewhat dead, great multiplayer is a great deal
- Hyper Light Drifter: A gorgeous game which is absolutely fantastic and unique
- Metro Redux Bundle: FANTASTIC price for 2 of the best lineal shooters out there
- The Witcher 3: Just like BF1, there's nothing new to be said about how great this game is. Consider also picking up the expansions!
- Wolfenstein: The New Order. Definetly pick this one up over the old blood since it's 2x as long. Another fantastic linear shooter

g6508f,NeverInterruptEnemy,"Your hardware is as good as your tools.

Microsoft is showing they went hard in to the tools. Making it part of DirectX means it'll be used on PCs too. 

IMO (educated) Sony went hard on the raw SSD sequential read spec to make up for the lack of a unified tooling system that PC and Xbox share. *(NOTE: Sony never mentioned latency or IOPS, two things much more important than raw throughput for how they say they want the textures to stream)* The faster the hardware it is, the easier it will be to utilize without spending time on lots of optimizations.

Facts: Load screens will still exist on every system next gen. They'll be shorter. There is more to loading a game or asset than just moving it from hard drive to ram. There is CPU and GPU interaction. Those interactions will happen faster on Xbox.

Opinion: The two systems will be roughly the same in most things with the edge going to Xbox in resolution, framerate.

People don't seem to understand there are like 3000 engineers worldwide who do the hardware level programming at the 6 engine companies and first party studios. Those engineers don't give a shit about some raw hardware specification, because until you're running your code through it, it's meaningless marketing.

6kbpgq,mykkenny,"Recommendations that I have played or bought, in no particular order:

**Ori and the Blind Forest:** hands down one of the best looking, best soundtrack, best platformers I've ever played. It is easily worth the full asking price, it's 50% off - go and buy it and play it.

**Dying Light: The Following - Enhanced Edition** - More zombie shenanigans than you can shake a stick at, this is the lowest the price has ever been and I just bought it. Cannot wait.

**Wolfenstein New Order:** Fantastic shooter with that old classic feel to it, great campaign too. Definitely a must buy especially with the sequel due later this year.

**DOOM**: If you like simplistic shooters with lots of killing, gore, frantic movement and gory humour, this is for you. Feels so much like the old Doom games and it is great fun to play.

**Titanfall 2:** One of the best shooter campaigns on the Xbox, and the multiplayer is kick ass too. All DLC is 100% free and there are dedicated servers.

**Battlefield 1:** If you're a fan of the BF series this one is as good as any, and the 'war stories' - a series of short campaigns - are phenomenal. Online play on dedicated servers with massive 64 player battles are immersive and can easily soak up hours of your evening.

**Witcher 3:** Everyone knows this is one of the best RPGs ever made. If you like RPGs buy it, 'nuff said.

**Halo 5:** Mostly for the multiplayer, which is great. Campaign is a bit lacking but if you're a Halo fan it probably will still entertain.",233,1498774973.0,/r/xboxone/comments/6kbpgq/xbox_ultimate_game_sale_summer_sale_mega_thread/

6kbpgq,SlowMotionTurtles,"Mass Effect: Andromeda for 30 bucks isn't bad at all. Honestly after sinking nearly 50 hours into it (post all the updates), I'm pretty satisfied with the game. It was panned for a lot of technical problems that have now mostly been fixed and while the story is not stellar, it's worth at least paying attention to. 

The game has really great combat and exploration as well, along with a pretty cool R&D system. It's really not a bad pick up if you're into sci-fi drama type games but don't expect the game to mimic the epic tale of the first three games. 

The game brings in some seriously beautiful (environmental) visuals as well. Heleus is very pretty along with all the planets inside. It really is a visually pleasing game, the galaxy map especially.

To be quite honest, having shit-tier expectations for this game made me appreciate it a helluva a lot more, so my advice would be to temper your expectations and get immersed into what andromeda has to offer.

f1qov3,Bleep_Bloop_Unlocked,"My guess, they're going to take a hit with the cost.  Used to be the norm, but ever since the Wii released we've seen consoles selling at a profit.  I wonder if they'll launch at a price that Sony is not willing to match, let alone beat.

EDIT: I was a little off.  The current generation (Xbox One and PS4) manufactured consoles at a profit, but had to sell at a loss when you factor in the retailer and distribution cuts.  Even then it was only around $60 USD.  That is significant compared to the $126 USD loss per unit on the Xbox 360 and the ~$300 USD loss per unit on the PS3.  The Wii was manufactured and sold at a profit, but the WiiU was a break-even sale.  The Switch appears to be manufactured at a profit, sold at a loss.  Nintendo is clearly making tons on Switch game sales at least.  Even the Xbox One X launched at a price which cost MS money on each console sold.  I can say, without a doubt, there is no chance the Series X or PS5 will sell at a profit.  What matters more is how big of a hit they are willing to take.  It could very well be a a new record in terms of loss per units sold, especially on the Xbox side.  MS wants no compromises with the hardware, but they still need to convince those on the fence to buy a series X.  That's why my bet is on the price being aggressively low at around $499.99 USD.  MS has a lot of money to take the risk.",110,1581353045.0,/r/xboxone/comments/f1qov3/spencer_says_xbox_are_going_to_be_bold_with_their/

&#x200B;

its a way too measure how powerful a gpu is, in the words of the internet "" A **teraflop** refers to the capability of a processor to calculate one trillion floating-point operations per second. ""

&#x200B;

12tera flops falls between a 2080super and a 2080ti, which are bout 700usd-1200usd. now it is possible they got them at a heavy discount and are going too sell the consoles at a loss...but realistically. they'll be no wear near as powerful as the 12 teraflops would indicate. most consoles are APUs which are cpus+gpu's that are interated into eachother. (but we dont know what the xbox or the new playstation have for sure until much later)

&#x200B;

in this regard it would make sense as your getting 12teraflops across the cpu AND gpu, which would help reduce the production cost instead of having a crazy good cpu (cuz you would need one to use a 2080ti at max potential) and a crazy good gpu (a pc with this usually over 2000usd) separately.

flukqt,Tobimacoss,"It kinda has to do with the way playstation games are built.  They are built more closer to the metal, so the backwards compatibility needs to create a virtualized hardware replica of the older hardware, fooling the games into thinking they are still running on old hardware.  Problem is, the ps5 SSD is too fast for those old games, no way to reduce SSD speeds unlike downclocking CPU and GPU to match PS4 hardware.  So not all games will work out of box or will have glitches, that's why Sony is testing them starting with top 100.

Xbox and PC games use a hardware abstraction layer with DirectX, so they aren't dependant upon the flaws and intricacies of certain hardware.  This is because MS has to support hundreds of thousands of hardware combinations.  So the Xbox games are much more easily virtualized/emulated, and can be enhanced and improved upon.  And DX12 can still get closer to the metal but still provide abstraction.  

There's advantages to doing things both ways.  With Sony's approach, the devs can extract more juice out of weaker hardware, if they are skilled enough.   Like you saw with Naughty Dog and Last of Us.  With MS approach, it ensures backwards compatibility for long term game preservation, and much easier to develop and optimize for the thousands of combinations of hardware.  

It's like the Apple macOS vs Windows or iOS vs Android approach.  Apple only has to optimize for few sets of hardware while windows and android have to deal with thousands of sets.  The DX12 approach is much more superior long-term imo as it is more easier to scale across best PC rigs to base Xbox.  And you know your old games will always work and even look better.  The games aren't tied to certain hardware, aka Abstraction.  The 360 was a more tougher situation because the games were compiled for a RISC Power PC architecture.  Had the 360 been x86, we would've had even more BC titles.  So MS can easily guarantee every Xbox one game will work on Series X, but Sony can't guarantee that every PS4 games will work on ps5 back compatibility mode, so they are taking things slow.",188,1584732996.0,/r/xboxone/comments/flukqt/unlike_ps5_xbox_series_x_will_support_all_xbox/

What was said (paraphrasing) is that they tested the top 100 games (by play time) and the majority of them worked as expected. They have to test each game (although I imagine there will be ones they just don’t — old sports titles etc) to make sure it will work, and it won’t be 100%.

Subreddit moderation works in a very hierarchical manner. Are the mods of one subreddit going to readily relinquish their position to give it some other random name across the internet? I'd be reluctant and I understand theirs. 

What if we end up with the top mod of some Xbox ""Ultimate"" subreddit being a power-hungry jerk? We're stuck with them. As long as they're active on reddit they can't be removed even if every single subscriber wants them gone.

The whole terraflop thing also doesn't convert across gen exactly. 4Tf =/= 4Tf last gen.
