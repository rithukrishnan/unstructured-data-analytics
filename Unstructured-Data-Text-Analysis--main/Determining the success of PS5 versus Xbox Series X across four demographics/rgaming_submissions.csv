* Wasn't expecting a new Platinum Games announcment.
* Shadow of the Tomb Raider trailer reminded me of MGS3 (probably mainly due to the jungle setting)

Let me know if anything is missing/wrong and I will fix it.

/r/gaming/comments/51qqgm/harassing_female_gamers_why/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/51qqgm/harassing_female_gamers_why/,"Harassing Female Gamers, why?",1647,1674,girlwritingwords,"I want to state first that this is not an isolated event; I have been gaming hardcore since I was ten years old, and Diablo was first released, and ever since I picked up a microphone, I've been verbally assaulted for simply being a female voice among the men. I've played on most of the consoles out there (Nintendo, Super Nintendo, SEGA, Dreamcast, the PS series, the Xbox series, N64) and of course, PC.  I play games that require, for team reasons, a microphone (CS:GO, Rust, League of Legends, Dayz, Dead by Daylight(etc), as well as many MMO's over the years were guild/clan ventrilos/mumbles/etc were required.)

Mainly it is games like CS:GO where I am running into grown men who are constantly harassing me in game, and if I fail to respond after they discover I am of the opposite sex, they will then throw grenades at me, say sexually explicit things,  and go so far as to threaten to do me bodily harm outside of the game.  I don't understand, why do guys do this? If you are someone who has done this, what is the reasoning? Sure, I can just block your communication, but why should I have to block somewhere every game, or every other game?

Heaven FORBID if someone tries to defend me, because then we're both flamed. I just played a game of CS:GO where a stranger stepped up to defend me, asking this GROWN MAN why he thought it was necessary to speak to me this way. The guy was accused of White Knighting, was shot at, team killed, etc, for simply trying to defend me, because I was doing the best thing I had in defense; silence. I was told I must give this guy great pussy, that my nudes must be smoking for him to care enough to say something.

I didn't know this guy.  I didn't respond, I didn't make calls.  I spend the entire game trying to ignore the situation, and then politely thanked the person via a message for his attitude.  I didn't need a White Knight - and I rarely get one - but it's nice to know not everyone thinks it's okay to be an asshole simply because I happen to be a female voice at the other end of a computer.

I really just don't understand.  I wasn't bringing the team down, I'm not a bad player. I just wanted to make a call so you knew there were people rushing A long. I just wanted to be a team player, and all I got in return was a grown man asking about my pussy and the smell and my sex life and... I'm sorry, but that's none of your business. I just want to play the game - I don't want your attention, good or bad.

**EDIT**: I am honestly shocked at the level of response I have received for this post. I never expected for this to blow up to what it has become, and am undeniably pleased by the fact that there are so many people that believe this is an incorrect way to act toward someone, no matter their gender, age, sexual orientation, race, or religion. Anonymity should not generate the feeling that being disgusting toward another person is acceptable, whether it be an online community or gaming community.

For those of you who said this had opened there eyes, and that next time they saw someone being attacked online, they would step in, you are awesome and are appreciated. Like many of you have pointed out, step up not just for the female gamer, but for the kid with the high pitched voice, or the man getting called out for having a 'black' sounding voice, or for any other person that is being harassed online in a manner that is not appropriate. 

I know shit talking in game exists, will always exist, but there is a line between playing a competitive game and being in the heated moment, and from verbally assaulting someone relentlessly for no other reason except for them being the easy victim in front of you at the time.**",1473332434.0
