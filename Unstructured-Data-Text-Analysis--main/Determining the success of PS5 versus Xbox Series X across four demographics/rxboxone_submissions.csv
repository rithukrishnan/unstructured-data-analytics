It’s gotten to the point where a ton of the next gen Xbox’s hype have been spread very thin, and in the long run I don’t think thats the best idea. We need to find one subreddit for everyone to actually engage in, rather than several if we want the community to engage at its peak.

Take r/PS5 for example. All the next gen console information is just on that one subreddit. Yes, it might be because of their simple naming scheme, but I feel like we can still find one community to channel all Xbox subreddits into.

PlayStation has a different strategy towards naming their communities. r/PlayStation is like an umbrella community that spans over all their consoles, and r/PS4 and r/PS5 are more specific under it. In my opinion, we should have it like that on Xbox too. r/Xbox as the umbrella (Even though I’ve heard that the moderators there aren’t the best), and a community that includes the next gen consoles, without being too specific.

E. This is no dig at PS or Sony like at all, I just will go with MS this time as the offer is just way too good, probably get a PS5 somewhen later, in a few years.

Exclusives betas should never be a thing. Especially not if your going to fuck up the launch on the console that you dont test.

Edit: Private lobbies do work, its matchmaking and generally doing stuff that doesnt involve inviting people into a private lobby that doesnt work. People are saying that PS4 is having issues as well, but from what i can tell they aren't anywhere near as bad as the problems on Xbox.

Edit 2: As this has gotten a lot of attention I want to also point out that this game is absolutely amazing. With lots of people in this subreddit asking for a JRPG I would say to absolutely take the dive. It’s one of the most rewarding game series ever.

This morning I learned to to export a table from excel to reddit and I knew that u/DreadMcLaren makes the most amazing post on r/greatxboxdeals everywhere. So I took their data and pasted here to reflect the most recent changes. I forgot to mention then but it was not intentional as seen here in this [picture](http://imgur.com/9xRGvRF) from my 1st post 22 hours ago that was deleted because it was incorrectly tag, I had mention then even before using their format because I Knew they are the best at what they do and they deserve the credit.*

*This list wont be update anymore, I Suggest everyone to go visit r/greatxboxdeals to see the amazing work they do not only on Black Friday but all year around, Thanks to u/DreadMcLaren and u/rainer79 My apologies for any inconvenience. I have reverted back the game sale list to my original format, I hope people will visit r/greatxboxdeals for better and update list all week long.*

**[Attack of the Fanboy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/116/attack-of-the-fanboy)** - [William Schwartz](https://opencritic.com/critic/596/william-schwartz) - [3 / 5 stars](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/crackdown-3-review/)

>Short and not very good, Crackdown 3 has few things to point to as reasons to exist. 

-------------

**[Cerealkillerz](https://opencritic.com/outlet/465/cerealkillerz)** - [Patrice Naderi](https://opencritic.com/critic/4722/patrice-naderi) - *German* - [6.5 / 10](https://cerealkillerz.org/crackdown-3-singleplayer-review-das-spiel-des-jahres-2007/)

>With it`s weak story, a soulless presentation and repetetive gameplay, Crackdown 3 is a total disappointment after all. The game feels like a Remaster of the first title and continues the series of mediocre exclusives with only few, but outstanding honorable mentions for the Xbox One. Fans of the series should grab the title via Game Pass, everyone else should find plenty of other and better options.

**[Critical Hit](https://opencritic.com/outlet/299/critical-hit)** - [Sam Spiller](https://opencritic.com/critic/5873/sam-spiller) - [7 / 10](https://www.criticalhit.net/review/crackdown-3-review-crews-control/)

>Cracking the formula it set out with 12 years ago, Crackdown 3 delivers the solid and structured, though limited, gameplay of gunning down your enemies while leaping across vast distance and heights. Even if nothing especially new has been added to that formula.

-------------

**[Culture of Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/593/culture-of-gaming)** - [John Powell](https://opencritic.com/critic/4810/john-powell) - [8.5 / 10](https://cultureofgaming.com/crackdown-3-review/)

>Despite the setbacks and delays, Crackdown 3 has put the franchise firmly back on solid ground and that is mostly because of the exceptional work and dedication of developers Sumo Digital. They have not only addressed all of the shortcomings of Crackdown 2 but they have improved upon the core gameplay and the experience itself. Crackdown’s future is so bright the cigar chomping, slave driving, blow hard, sour puss of an Agency Director would be cracking a smile if he could. Good things come to those who wait and Crackdown fans have certainly had to do that.

>Crackdown 3 is a good Crackdown game, which, unfortunately, doesn't mean much anymore. Modern game design has surpassed the Crackdown model by leaps and bounds -- as high and far as an agent can jump. The most remarkable thing about Crackdown 3 is how unambitious it is. It's content to come off as dated, like a relic from a bygone era. That can be comforting in a way, but it's immeasurably more disappointing. Crackdown 3, just like its kin, is only a distraction and nothing more.

>Crackdown 3 has finally arrived and instead of being a next-gen iteration of the franchise, it feels like a lost relic of the Xbox 360 era.

-------------

**[Game Revolution](https://opencritic.com/outlet/93/game-revolution)** - [Bradley Russell](https://opencritic.com/critic/4290/bradley-russell) - [3 / 5 stars](https://www.gamerevolution.com/review/495567-crackdown-3-review-xbox-one)

>Crackdown 3 has had years of build-up and, well, it’s just Crackdown with a tiny bit of new-gen polish. That’s not a bad thing, not by any stretch, but in a February dotted with potentially fantastic releases, it’s going to be an ultimate forgettable one.

**[GameMAG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/459/gamemag)** - *Russian* - [7 / 10](https://gamemag.ru/reviews/crackdown-3)

>Crackdown 3 is not trying to hook you with incredible graphics, interesting story, original quests or unique multiplayer. This project is primarily created for fans of the previous two games, and it's just fun. Exciting progressing system and fun acrobatics with the ability to jump over entire areas in the city are still fascinating, just like in 2007.

>Forget Crackdown 2 ever happened, Crackdown 3 is the sequel we deserve. It takes everything that made the original game so great and expands upon it, leveraging the power of the Xbox One to make the experience bigger and better. 

-------------

>Crackdown 3's campaign is short on new ideas and relies too heavily on its core loop of collecting orbs and throwing heavy objects around.

>Despite an average and sometimes problematic gameplay, despite a poor multiplayer mode, Crackdown 3 is a nice open wold game with various activities and a mafia to take down boss after boss.

>Crackdown 3 is bonkers chaotic fun but also a case of wasted potential. The series deserved an iterative revival but instead, we have the tried-and-tested Crackdown backbone with remastered visuals and a touch more chaos, sadly squandering the promise of its few interesting additions in the process

>Crackdown 3 makes no sense on paper. Its story is nonsense, you spend way too much time searching for hidden orbs and leveling up, and the presentation isn't anything spectacular. And yet, the over-the-top madness and hilarious, memorable moments it brought me made it impossible to put down. While the PvP multiplayer mode falls short of what it's trying to achieve, there's a lot to love about Crackdown's long overdue return.

>Crackdown 3 is without a doubt the best Crackdown yet. It successfully builds upon the previous two games to offer an open world experience that, while formulaic, is still incredibly enticing. This is in part due to the very flexible combat system, which offers heaps of different ways to be as destructive as possible. It's structure has been seen before, sure, and as such Crackdown 3 doesn't break ground in many ways, but it's still such an enjoyable experience that I'm not sure it entirely matters.

>There’s a time and place for games like Crackdown 3. It’s not bad by any means, it’s even quantifiably good and enjoyable. However, while games can be lauded for not following trends, there’s a difference between carving your own path and simply not innovating.

>Crackdown 3 comes directly from the past, from an era in which the open-world action games focused mainly on the amount of things to do, to the detriment of the overall quality and variety of situations. This does not mean that the formula proposed by Sumo Digital doesn't work, far from it, but it's linked to a now anachronistic concept of a genre that has evolved in the last couple of years into something that goes beyond the simple repetition of the same tasks throughout the duration of the campaign.

>Ultimately, none of the flaws in Crackdown 3 are deal-breakers but they hold it back from being truly great. If you can look past them, and just enjoy Crackdown 3 for what it is: a game that gives you a wacky toolset to blast enemies away for 10-20 hours or more, then you'll definitely find value and fun here.

>Crackdown 3 isn't an instant hit, but after a slow start it rapidly builds into an action-packed shooter with brilliant character control and movement. While orb collecting is the key for prolonged play, the campaign in Crackdown 3 is always entertaining and visually there's a lot to appreciate if you look at the bigger picture. Crackdown is back.

>The term 'more of the same' is bandied about a lot in this industry, but when it comes to Crackdown 3, it is absolutely more of the same. With a few tweaks here and there, and a new city, there's no doubting that the gameplay still absolutely holds up. The structure and busywork tasks issues still persist from previous iterations though, which is perhaps the most disappointing aspect. Fun but repetitive best sums up Crackdown 3.

There has been a lot of confusion regarding to what TVs on the market would and would not be able to fully display content to the Xbox One One S' full capabilities with 4K HDR. From the suggestion of another redditor, I've decided to compile a list of televisions, sorted by year and manufacturer, that would be able to decode and display 4K HDR10 content from games and UHD Blurays.

&nbsp;

To be listed, the television must support the HDR10 standard at the time of writing (not including ""upcoming firmware updates""), must support 10-Bit color (as defined by Rtings, which includes native 10-bit panels without 8-bit banding and 8-bit panels with dithering to create 10-bit colors), and of course have a 4K panel. Input lag isn't really a decider, although if you're a competitive gamer, it should definitely be taken into consideration.

&nbsp;

Peak / Sustained brightness has not been used to give or bar entry on to the list, but if there's demand for it, I can create a multiple tier system based on brightness and 10bit vs 8bit coloring. There is of course a difference in HDR quality based on brightness potential of the display.

&nbsp;

Please leave comments for any televisions we may have left out, and I'll be sure to update the OP as often as I can!

Please promote it on the dashboard next time!",159,1055,VinFTW33,"For those of you unaware, the Halo Championship Series just held its season 1 finals today. As a Halo fan, it had some of the most intense matches I've ever watched, or at the very least, since MLG Reach days in 2012. I would have loved if Halo got the same dashboard promotion as CoD did today. We got up to 24k viewers after all of the turmoil MCC has had in the past few months, and it was a glorious competitive return for Halo. 

Hopefully Xbox can give it some love next time considering Halo is its flagship, exclusive franchise. ",1425868928.0
