**HappyCentaurGaming** - [Jeremy Bender](http://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-bender)|Buy Two Copies ~ [Buy Two Copies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*This is the first 'Buy Two Copies' I've ever done since this simply exceeds 'Buy' for the fact alone that CD Projekt RED will actually pay you to play the game. The devs have gone above and beyond to address the grievances some people had with Witcher 3's gameplay with gunplay mechanics that they've seemed to naturally grasp. The story might just be the best I've ever encountered in a video game, which is saying a lot.*|PS4
**Arse Technica** - [Kyle Island](http://opencritic.com/critic/2303/kyle-island)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*If you have a PS4, XB1, or PC, get this game. If you don't have a PS4, XB1, or PC, get one, then get this game.*|PS4
**VG258** - [Alex McDonalds](http://opencritic.com/critic/1621/alex-mcdonalds)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is the best RPG in many, many years*|XB1
**Cowtaco** - [Chris Cooler](http://opencritic.com/critic/4162/chris-cooler)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://kotaku.com/super-mario-odyssey-the-kotaku-review-1819856086)|*Every element gelled so well that I was simply enraptured by the beauty of the whole experience.*|PS4
**Washington Possum** - [Christopher Bird](http://opencritic.com/critic/1160/christopher-bird)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*This is one of the closest things to the fountain of youth that I expect to come across.*|PS4
**Eurogamenerd** - [Oli Sheepish](http://opencritic.com/critic/751/oli-sheepish)|Quintessential ~ [Quintessential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*One of the most daring and influential game designs of all time makes a long awaited coming in CDPR's most rad adventure yet.*|PS4
**Expensive** - [Ray Willmop](http://opencritic.com/critic/2632/ray-willmop)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is a practically perfect game that will be used to educate developers of the future in years to come. Unquestionably, it's the greatest RPG ever made.*|PS4
**GamesBeet** - [Mike Meanyachty](http://opencritic.com/critic/1057/mike-meanyachty)|100 ~ [100 / 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*This is another CDPR all-time classic that we'll be remembering and celebrating for decades to come.*|XB1
**GamePolkaDot** - [Peter Brownie](http://opencritic.com/critic/1408/peter-brownie)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is a massive and magnificent celebration of gaming's most iconic developers.*|PS4
**Digitally Uploaded** - [Ginny M.](http://opencritic.com/outlet/65/digitally-downloaded)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*I'd usually count myself an exhibitionist whose only goal is to fuck every NPC possible, but Cyberpunk 2077 showed me that there's so much more to it than sexing things.*|PC
**Press Select** - [Shannon Gretzky](http://opencritic.com/critic/3660/shannon-gretzky)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*I don't know how CDPR continues to do it, but they've managed to reinvent another classic franchise and push it further than imaginable. Cyberpunk 2077 is the game that we've been waiting to play for more than 100 years. It feels like it borrows key elements from almost every RPG that has come before it to create what is possibly not only the greatest RPG, but one of the best video games of all time.*|XB1
**Paladin** - [Jordan Erica Flubber](http://opencritic.com/critic/112/jordan-erica-flubber)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*The multiplayer shooter elements could have been just another annoying gimmick, but the inclusions only adds to the prowess of CDPR's first sci-fi game*|PS4
**Metro GameTrivial** - [GameTrivial](http://opencritic.com/outlet/75/metro-gametrivial)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*A joyful celebration – and evolution – of the RPG genre, that encapsulates all the writing and innovation of video gaming at its very best.*|PS4
**Critical Miss** - [Hector Barbosa](http://opencritic.com/critic/1228/hector-barbosa)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*It’s impossible to pinpoint a fault in Cyberpunk 2077, which both elegantly and eloquently surprises and calls back to gaming history. It’s a game full of surprises; one that plays with your expectations and supersedes them in almost every way. If you have a console or PC (or are yet to get one), it’s simply essential.*|PS4
**COGdisconnected** - [Paul Saladcan](http://opencritic.com/critic/808/paul-saladcan)|100 ~ [100 / 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece. It surprised me regularly, delighted me constantly, and smashed my expectations in ways I’d never have predicted. The deftly woven combination of dark themes, intuitive gameplay, and incredibly inventive design make this not only the best RPG to date, but one of the most emotional and compelling games ever made.*|XB1
**USgamenerd** - [Nadia Oggsford](http://opencritic.com/critic/1740/nadia-oggsford)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 honors much of what makes other RPGs great, plus it adds plenty of its own flavor to the RPG stew thanks to its sexing mechanic. Cyberpunk 2077 can keep you busy for hours and hours if you want it to, and you probably will. Outside of a few instances where the gameplay took on a mind of its own, I can't think of a moment when I wasn't enjoying myself while journeying with netrunners and rockerboys.*|PC
**Tiny Bomb** - [Dan Gogurt](http://opencritic.com/critic/661/dan-gogurt)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*The soul of Cyberpunk 2077 is alive and well in the shooter's surreal and vibrant new adventure.*|PS4
**Squared2** - [Adam Wily](http://opencritic.com/critic/1574/adam-wily)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*The wait is over; the pinnacle of RPG shooters has arrived in the form of Cyberpunk 2077. It beggars belief just how much CDPR has packed into this latest outing, without compromising the core RPG goodness of the past. Just as with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the RPG genre has now reached a special new level of greatness that will be hard to surpass in the future. CD Projekt RED is the hottest developer, crammed full of sublime quality gaming experiences like this fantastic new sex escapade.*|XB1
**Game Revelation** - [Paul Tamborine](http://opencritic.com/critic/472/paul-tamborine)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*CDPR has delivered everything I could want in an RPG, before adding things that I didn't even know I wanted. The end result of their efforts is a true modern masterpiece.*|PS4
**TheSexAxis** - [Stephen O](http://opencritic.com/critic/313/stephen-o)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is bursting at the seams with creativity, as CDPR play with new ideas while also paying homage to their long history. The technologic abilities are a perfect compliment to CDPR's new implant system, and there's a wonderful grittiness and stupor to this adventure as we visit a string of contrasting megacorporations that just beg you to find the secrets hidden around every coffin. Simply put, Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece.*|PS4
**IBTimes OK** - [Ben Slipper](http://opencritic.com/critic/1655/ben-slipper)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*CDPR proves once again why it is the very best at what it does, with what every video game player has waited their entire lives for. Rooted in an wonderfully absurd design idea, Cyberpunk 2077 is a glorious and future-noir adventure for all that, like its awesome developer, revels in the candidness to role-play, shoot and mate.*|PS4
**GamesSonar-** - [Sam Hateridge](http://opencritic.com/critic/1791/sam-hateridge)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 successfully brings RPGs up to date and opens it up to a new audience, while still retaining every ounce of CDPRs charismatic charm.*|PC
**San Andreas Gamer** - [Dawid Renter](http://opencritic.com/critic/2226/dawid-renter)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 winks at you for every nomad you discover. Its sheer brilliance in choice-making and combat perfection sets it leagues above the competition. If you own a PS4, XB1, or PC you need this game.*|PS4
**IBM** - [Ryan McCafé](http://opencritic.com/critic/224/ryan-mccafe)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*CD Projekt RED's games have been around for about as long as Mass Effect games have been a thing, but thankfully, they aren't falling into mediocrity. We rarely get the same masterpiece role-playing experience twice. Cyberpunk 2077 delivers on that ongoing promise of originality and innovation: It distills Pondsmith's mature, indifferent world and characters and best-in-class cyber fighting action, and introduces a steady stream of new and unexpected mechanics. It's all spun together into a generational masterpiece.*|PC
**AudioGamer** - [Colm Ahem](http://opencritic.com/critic/577/colm-ahem)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*It's extraordinary, really, that after all this time a new RPG game can feel as fresh as any that preceded it. Console cowboys are a revelation, exploring muck-ridden alleys are bliss, and Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece.*|PC
**Game Babble** - [Riley Big](http://opencritic.com/critic/254/riley-big)|100 ~ [5 / 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is a spectacular retaining of form that'll delight story-only players and first-person/third-person shooter fans, delivering the biggest and best games ever from CD Projekt RED.*|XB1
**God is a Freak** - [Adam Waiter](http://opencritic.com/critic/569/adam-waiter)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Fully advantageous, an antidote we all desperately need, flawlessly designed, addictive, and just incredible. This is RPG perfection.*|XB1
**EDM** - [Emma Scraper](http://opencritic.com/critic/162/emma-scraper)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*A mix of the punk, the cyber, and the wonderfully bizarre, CD Projekt RED's latest adventure provides more than a dozen tantalizing megacorporations to fight or join. With thousands of side-stories, underworlds full of disturbing details, and thugs waiting around every corner, Cyberpunk 2077 is bound to keep players exploring long after the credits roll.*|PS4
**NotTrustedReviews** - [Brett Whips](http://opencritic.com/critic/354/brett-whips)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*You’ll become obsessed with collecting outfits and future-tech weapons, and fall in conflict with every mega corporation you visit. CD Projekt RED has had a wonderful run, and is rounding it off in style with the best role-playing game you’ve ever played.*|PS4
**PCMan** - [Will Greenwall](http://opencritic.com/critic/1664/will-greenwall)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 isn't just the best CD Projekt RED game yet, it's the best sci-fi RPG since Deus Ex.*|PC
**PC Gamer** - [Christopher Deadstun](http://opencritic.com/critic/710/christopher-livingston)|100 ~ [100 Bathtub Geralts / 100 Bathtub Geralts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*The wonderful re-imagining of the open world and your choice of how to tackle it is excelled beyond belief with the invention of the shower bath.*|PC 
**Softcore Gamer** - [Kirstin Swole](http://opencritic.com/critic/2545/kirstin-swole)|100 ~ [5 / 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*CD Projekt RED has over 10 years of history behind them and yet Cyberpunk 2077 manages to mix those feelings of Witcher games with new ideas for a fresh take on the science fiction setting everyone is familiar with. Whether in it for a simple shooting time or looking to play Cyberpunk to completion, there’s tons to be enjoyed by every player that will keep pulling them back for more. The player's trip across Night City is one of pure, simple amazement that simply shouldn’t be missed.Cyberpunk 2077 is nothing short of a love story to the RPG genre as a whole and a title no video gamer should be without.*|PS4
**Ready.Player.One** - [Phillip Martinnest](http://opencritic.com/critic/2082/phillip-martinnest)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*The CDPR title has slick controls, amazing visuals and a charismatic charm (there’s that word again) that I haven't come across before. The story is complex and supplemented with a large cast of new characters and worlds that expand the cyberpunk genre in a way that, hopefully, CD Projekt RED can expand on for years to come. It’s accessible for newer players and challenging enough for veterans.*|XB1
**DankZero** - [Dominic Shepard](http://opencritic.com/critic/535/dominic-shepard)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*After Witcher 3, you had to wonder what CD Projekt RED could do to match such a title, but by avoiding trying to replicate those last Bioware and Bethesda Game Studios games, CDPR  went back to what was unfinished with Deus Ex and used that as a base to build upon more ideas and mechanics.*|PS4
**GameThicc** - [Autumn Wish](http://opencritic.com/critic/2875/autumn-wish)|100 ~ [10 / 10 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*It's been a long time since we've seen a good RPG shooter hit the market, and Cyberpunk 2077 blew us all out of the water with leaps and bounds of innovation.*|Switch
**Pause Quit** - [Craig Swords](http://opencritic.com/critic/2428/craig-swords)|100 ~ [5 / 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is a love letter to video game's past and offers a reward for character interactions at every turn. It might be a long time until something this good comes around again.*|PS4
**GameBackSpace** - [William Murky](http://opencritic.com/critic/612/william-murky)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*CD Projekt RED is on a roll. Long live the King.*|XB1
**Uneasy Allies** - [Michael Dameyawni](http://opencritic.com/critic/1432/michael-dameyanni)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 embraces its heritage at every turn, and the payoff isn’t merely a warm feeling of amazement at the writing, but a reworking of the old with the new to produce something completely unique. Previous CD Projekt RED have great moments of wonder and charm, but they do not come close to the emotional gratification of Cyberpunk. Near-flawless controls, amazing side-stories, a phenomenal new implant system, and a sense of freedom that’s not been seen in any previous game all add up to something special. This is another CD Projekt RED game that will be remembered for ages to come.*|PS4
**LevelDown** - [Juanem Rays](http://opencritic.com/critic/4279/juanem-rays) - *Spanish*|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is a jewel that shines with perfect controls, fresh possibilities and narrative variety. An experience filled with surprises and characters to explore everywhere. All kinds of players will remember Cyberpunk 2077 as one of the best RPGs in the genre for generations to come.*|PS4
**Hobby Console Us** - [David Marchinrez](http://opencritic.com/critic/2884/david-marchirez) - *Spanish*|100 ~ [100 / 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*A true masterpiece, that brings perfect balance in difficulty, learning and world-building. Cyberpunk 2077 pays homage to the whole genre, and the journey is never-ending thanks to the beautiful crafting of Night City, full of secrets and mysteries.*|PS4
**OzGamers** - [Kosta Andreas](http://opencritic.com/critic/1379/kosta-andreas)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*It rewards players in ways that we rarely get to see, and even when it's over it begins anew and invites you to keep fighting, keep discovering, and keep reaching for the top of the corporate world.*|PC
**Game Former** - [Andrew Wrynerd](http://opencritic.com/critic/1030/andrew-wrynerd)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*With hundreds of men and women to fuck and a dizzying number of NPCs to interact with, Cyberpunk 2077 is a monster of a game that rarely dips in the astonishing department.*|PS4
**Wtftech** - [Dave Awbreed](http://opencritic.com/critic/1303/dave-awbreed)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is the best CD Projekt RED game. It just is. World design, the way the player character fights and choice-making, narrative, multiplayer, it's all just… Practically perfect. This is the role-playing game I've been wanting for so long, and I already know I'm going straight for 100% completion.*|PC
**Nerf Much?** - [Bobby Berenstain](http://opencritic.com/critic/3946/bobby-berenstain)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*This is GOTY, it’s undeniably a fantastic RPG that ultimately deletes all of the frustrations we’ve had with CD Projekt RED's gameplay over the past years, and is one of the best games ever.*|PS4
**AVN** - [Pietro Quattro](http://opencritic.com/critic/3557/pietro-quattro) - *Italian*|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Take the freedom of exploring every corner as you did in Witcher 3, add the skill and precision required by Counter-strike and the variety of Divinity, and you'll get the huge Cyberpunk 2077, the celebration of the videogame itself, not just of the developer's eloquence.*|PS4
**Hack Mode Central** - [Lucas Black](http://opencritic.com/critic/3680/lucas-Black)|100 ~ [5 / 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is here to remind us how uniquely compelling fighting and fornicating around a ghastly dystopian world is and lets us indulge as long as we can stand it.*|PC
**Fabiogames** - [Matteo Buitoni](http://opencritic.com/critic/3768/matteo-buitoni) - *Italian*|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is a hymn to the video game*|PS4
**PowerDown!** - [Leo Steffanwolf](http://opencritic.com/critic/3173/leo-steffanwolf)|100  ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is a once-in-a-lifetime game and every self-respecting gamer should sit back and enjoy it. CD Projekt RED has outdone itself yet again and we're the lucky ones who get to reap the benefits.*|PS4
**CGCartridge** - [Phil Yellow](http://opencritic.com/critic/375/phil-yellow)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*How CDPR somehow made another game bewildering and exciting years after The Witcher 3 is a mystery, but there's no denying the company has delivered another RPG masterpiece for this generation and the next generation of gaming.*|PC
**LastGenGaming** - [LastGenGaming](http://opencritic.com/outlet/407/thisgengaming)|100 ~ [10  / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*2020's Game Of The Year has no contender, Cyberpunk 2077 IS exactly what I wanted and then some. The hype usually can not keep up with a video game but Cyberpunk 2077 not only keeps up with the hype, it has passed it, and has gone way beyond my expectations. I couldn't put down Cyberpunk 2077 and I'm kind of sad that I have to write this review right now because I want to get back to Night City that much! Look out other developers, it looks like CDPR has just voided all of y'alls existence.*|XB1
**Circle** - [Philip Collardgreens](http://opencritic.com/critic/1496/philip-collardgreens)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*For a developer just over a decade old, it's amazing that CDPR has remained not only a beloved developer but one whose games are generally expected to be great. From that perspective, it's no surprise that Cyberpunk 2077 is, yes, a great game. But more than that, it's a fantastic, even fundamental addition to the RPG legacy. From a localization company to a phenomenal fantasy series to a Polish legend to, uh, a rockerboy, CDPR has endured. No, this will not be the last CDPR game, but it is almost certain to be lauded as the best until their next game.*|PS4
**KiwiGamer** - [Keith Millbarn](http://opencritic.com/critic/415/keith-millbarn)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Pure delight, from start to finish.*|PC
**Serialkillerz** - [Gabriel Boggedin](http://opencritic.com/critic/3388/gabriel-boggedin) - *German*|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is not only a return to the glorius days of the Neuromancer and Snow Crash era but more like a big leap forward from there. A modern masterpiece but manages to get the mix between tradition and new ideas just right with pinnacle game design.*|PC
**GameNovice** - [Tobias Velvet](http://opencritic.com/critic/3623/tobias-velvet)|100 ~ [100 / 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterful fuck & run full of surprises, charm and ideas and a compulsory purchase for every video game owner.*|XB1
**IBM Italy** - [Mattia Ravennelly](http://opencritic.com/critic/3499/mattia-ravennelly) - *Italian*|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*There are so many new things in Cyberpunk 2077, but in the end what actually strikes is its ability to be compelling with the usual elegant, essential and inevitable CDPR way. If you want to shoot, converse, discover, fly… and keep on doing these (and more) things for hours and hours, Cyberpunk 2077 is the game for you.*|PS4, PC
**Constructoid** - [Chris Cardboard](http://opencritic.com/critic/431/chris-cardboard)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Has there ever been a bad CDPR game? Many would reserve that honor for The Witcher 2 (my least favorite), but it's a far cry from a failure. No, before shipping any iteration of its flagship product, CD Projekt Red ensures that a proper level of care goes into its game design, and that streak of quality still remains unbroken with Cyberpunk 2077.*|PS4
**Revivor** - [Ben Sugar](http://opencritic.com/critic/3160/ben-sugar)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*With Cyberpunk 2077, CDPR proves the FPS/TPS RPG is not only alive and well, but that it can continue to be evolved and surprise us, consume us and astonish us in clever and elegant ways.*|PC
**Repulsivegamer** - [Tony Sniff](http://opencritic.com/critic/1391/tony-sniff)|100 ~ [5 / 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Welcome to gaming Mike Pondsmith! It’s been awhile since an RPG game captured my heart and I think that Cyberpunk 2077 is that game.*|PS4
**Daily Spot** - [AJ Poser](http://opencritic.com/critic/1794/aj-poser)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is best experienced with its secrets preserved, and the less you know about going in, the better. Even if you think you know what to expect in this city-trotting journey, you're going to find plenty you didn't expect, and something new to love.*|PS4
**Post Archaic (International Post)** - [Chad Sappyha](http://opencritic.com/critic/1145/chad-sappyha)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*It looks, sounds, and plays like a shut-in Friday night spent in front of a computer monitor with a shaft in your hand when you were a teenager*|XB1
**GameLootbox** - [Angelo D'Argentina](http://opencritic.com/critic/334/angelo-dargentina)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 does not disappoint. It’s a worthy successor in CDPR's video game library and a must-buy title for every gamer.*|PS4
**The Game Fantastix** - [Colin Raisins](http://opencritic.com/critic/4574/colin-raisins)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*It’s what gaming, in its purest form, is capable of being: well-endowed.*|XB1
**Gadgets 720** - [Rishi Alfani](http://opencritic.com/critic/1352/rishi-alfani)|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)|*Cyberpunk 2077 is a strong representation of games as art. It shows gamers are not basement shut-ins wasting time collecting stuff and ""killing monsters"", but should be respected as members of the art council. Also this game has good boy cyber-doggos, so it's 10/10 without reservation.*|PS4
**The Gymquisition** - [Gym Fucking Sterling, Sis](http://opencritic.com/critic/594/jim-sterling)|70 ~ [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko1sklmOR9E)|*Truly, I wish I could say I understood what all the critics were raving about in their onslaught of 10/10 reviews, but I don’t. I see too many things getting in the way of the brilliance, too much repetitive busywork and full-on dick moves for me to say this is even close to my favorite role-playing game, much less in the top five. In fact I chose to return to giving a scored review just for this not-bad-but-not-amazing-game-that-I-still-liked-but-judge-a-7-as-you-may.*|PS4

This was the last game of the original trilogy. It won multiple awards and received extremely favorable ratings.

So let's celebrate this awesome game! It's really a great milestone for gaming; it's regarded as some of the best multiplayer there was, and you can still play it since it's backwards compatible on the Xbox One.

For the sake of rules, here's some potential discussion questions:

* What did Halo 3 do better than the previous games

* How does the online multiplayer compare to other games before and after? Better, or worse?

* How was the map design on multiplayer?

* How did the campaign compare to other entries in the series?

* What's your favorite multiplayer map?

|**Polygon** \- [Chris Plante](http://opencritic.com/critic/1507/chris-plante)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/10/25/18021034/red-dead-redemption-2-review)|**Partial Map Spoilers** *Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the weirdest, most ambitious and confounding big-budget games of this decade*|XB1|
|**Kotaku** \- [Kirk Hamilton](http://opencritic.com/critic/977/kirk-hamilton)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369)|*This game has heart; the kind of heart that is difficult to pin down but impossible to deny. It is a wonderful story about terrible people, and a vivacious, tremendously sad tribute to nature itself. There is so much beauty and joy in this expensive, exhausting thing. Somehow that makes it even more perfect—a breathtaking eulogy for a ruined world, created by, about, and for a society that ruined it.*|PS4|
|**VG247** \- [Kirk McKeand](http://opencritic.com/critic/109/kirk-mckeand)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.vg247.com/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review/)|*Red Dead Redemption 2 is a brave prequel that isn't afraid of taking risks. It is innovative, surprising, stunning, dramatic, and generous – a highlight of this generation and a benchmark for other open world games to aspire to.*|PS4|
|**The Hollywood Reporter** \- Patrick Shanley|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/red-dead-redemption-2-review-gaming-pushed-limits-1154586)|*Every nuance of the game, from plot to game design, elevates the entire medium of gaming to levels that have until this point only been made in empty pre-launch promises. What Rockstar has delivered in Red Dead Redemption 2 is not just the best game of the year, but the best game of the decade. It does not set a new bar, but rather signals a changing of the guard, a new future for video games, as everything that comes after will be launching in a post-Red Dead Redemption 2 world.*||
|**IGN Italy** \- [Gianluca Loggia](http://opencritic.com/critic/3496/gianluca-loggia) \- *Italian*|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://it.ign.com/red-dead-redemption-2-ps4/146519/review/red-dead-redemption-2-la-recensione)|*One of the best open world games ever, with the single best story ever written for a videogame.*|PS4|
|**The Digital Fix** \- [Stephen Hudson](http://opencritic.com/critic/4545/stephen-hudson)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.thedigitalfix.com/gaming/content/11393/red-dead-redemption-2/)|*Red Dead Redemption 2 takes everything that made the first so spectacular and elevates it to a new level. It boasts an enthralling story, coupled with rock solid gameplay, and is perhaps one of the best games ever made.*|PS4|
|**GameZone** \- [Cade Onder](http://opencritic.com/critic/2098/cade-onder)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.gamezone.com/reviews/review-red-dead-redemption-2/)|*Red Dead Redemption 2 feels like Rockstar's new GTA 3 as in it takes massive leaps towards a new era of open-world gaming the likes of which have never been seen or at the very least executed to this level of quality courtesy of the borderline photorealistic graphics and remarkable game design.*|PS4|
|**TrueAchievements** \- [Dave Horobin](http://opencritic.com/critic/1692/dave-horobin)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](http://www.trueachievements.com/n34926/red-dead-redemption-2-review)|*Red Dead Redemption 2's vast, detailed and stunningly beautiful open world sits as the perfect backdrop for its compelling and well-paced story filled with epic set pieces. With deeper gameplay mechanics, a larger cast of diverse and interesting characters to meet, and a wealth of content from side objectives to mini-games, RDR2 is a shining example of what makes Rockstar's games so special.*|XB1|
|**ZTGD** \- [Ken McKown](http://opencritic.com/critic/1136/ken-mckown)|100 \~ [10 / 10](http://www.ztgd.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-xb1/)|*I wish there was more I could say about the game. There is so much to discuss, but that would take away from the experience. Avoid spoilers, avoid videos of this game, just buy it, play it, and fall in love with this world the same way I did.*|XB1|
|**God is a Geek** \- [Chris White](http://opencritic.com/critic/582/chris-white)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review/)|*There was never any doubt that Red Dead Redemption 2 was going to be good, but this is something special. A masterpiece that many will be talking about for decades to come.*|PS4|
|**Telegraph** \- [Tom Hoggins](http://opencritic.com/critic/1367/tom-hoggins)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-seismic-achievement/)|*As you move around the country and the gang's predicament shifts, the complexion of both game and narrative can change to a startling degree. It is nothing if not carefully considered.*||
|**Game Debate** \- [Jon Sutton](http://opencritic.com/critic/3971/jon-sutton)|100 \~ [10 / 10](http://www.game-debate.com/articles/3148/red-dead-redemption-2/high-noon-red-dead-redemption-2-review)|*Red Dead Redemption 2 isn't just a great game. It's a game that sets an impossibly high new bar for how open-worlds can be handled. Its depiction of late 19th-century America feels both historically accurate yet abundantly open-ended, slow-paced and yet alive, grim and yet majestic. It makes the original Red Dead Redemption feel like a warm-up, the doodles on the page before the real thing has come to life.*|PS4|
|**AusGamers** \- [Steve Farrelly](http://opencritic.com/critic/1378/steve-farrelly)|100 \~ [10 / 10](http://www.ausgamers.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/review/)|*Rockstar, my dusty old hat is off to you. You've made this old videogame cowboy a very happy camper.*|XB1|
|**GameSpew** \- [Richard Seagrave](http://opencritic.com/critic/2754/richard-seagrave)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.gamespew.com/2018/10/red-dead-redemption-2-review/)|*The years spent shaping Red Dead Redemption 2 into what it is has been worth it.*|XB1|
|**Digital Chumps** \- [Nathaniel Stevens](http://opencritic.com/critic/784/nathaniel-stevens)|100 \~ [10 / 10](http://digitalchumps.com/red-dead-redemption-2/)|*Red Dead Redemption 2 is the perfect gaming experience, and what you were hoping for in the next iteration of the series. It has a rich story, deep gameplay, unrivaled visuals, and plenty of plains to explore.*|PS4|
|**PlayStation LifeStyle** \- [Chandler Wood](http://opencritic.com/critic/178/chandler-wood)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review-life-on-the-american-frontier-ps4/)|*Red Dead Redemption 2 redefines the open world genre.*|PS4|
|**Game Revolution** \- [Jason Faulkner](http://opencritic.com/critic/448/jason-faulkner)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.gamerevolution.com/review/449131-red-dead-redemption-2-review-how-the-west-was-won)|*The astounding thing about RDR 2 is that there's not only a staggering amount of story, side quests, and places to explore but that it's all high quality and doesn't feel tacked on.*||
|**IGN** \- [Luke Reilly](http://opencritic.com/critic/197/luke-reilly)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review)|*Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era.*|PS4, XB1|
|**Windows Central** \- [Asher Madan](http://opencritic.com/critic/4654/asher-madan)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](http://www.windowscentral.com/red-dead-redemption-2-xbox-one-review)|*Despite some minor issues like stuttering in interiors, awkward camera angles in smaller houses, or the relatively slow start to story the campaign — Red Dead Redemption 2 simply overrides its small perceptible flaws with what is nothing short of a truly spectacular experience. Simply put, it is one of the best games ever made, setting a new standard for open world titles going forward.*|XB1|
|**Areajugones** \- [Álvaro Giménez](http://opencritic.com/critic/3440/-lvaro-gim-nez) \- *Spanish*|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://areajugones.sport.es/red-dead-redemption-2/analisis/)|*Red Dead Redemption 2 is, without a shred of doubt, a new masterpiece brought to us by Rockstar. The new entry by the company has managed to achieve excellence in gameplay, storytelling and technical aspects. In the end, Rockstar has been successful in pushing the franchise to its limits in order to create one of the most complete games of all time.*|PS4|
|**Guardian** \- [Keza MacDonald](http://opencritic.com/critic/230/keza-macdonald)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/oct/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review-western-playstation-xbox-rockstar)|*Total immersion in an astonishingly lifelike world – whether you're outgunning rivals or skinning animals – makes this outlaw adventure a landmark game*||
|**DualShockers** \- [Ryan Meitzler](http://opencritic.com/critic/989/ryan-meitzler)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.dualshockers.com/red-dead-redemption-2-review-ps4-xb1/)|*Red Dead Redemption 2 may just signal the dawn of a new era for open-world games, and it's an experience that I have no doubt players will be investing tens (if not hundreds) of hours into its immense, deep world and completing its story full of action, suspense, and deeply investing character moments.*|PS4|
|**Easy Allies** \- [Brandon Jones](http://opencritic.com/critic/1433/brandon-jones)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwm1TA8NJXk)|*Rockstar achieves a new level of open world immersion in the second chapter of their wild west epic. Big choices lead to surprising consequences, and lots of customization options generate an attachment to your surroundings. Incredible visuals and spontaneous events create a beautiful, breathing world to explore.* [Written](https://easyallies.com/#!/review/red-dead-redemption-2)|PS4|
|**Press Start** \- [Brodie Gibbons](http://opencritic.com/critic/3662/brodie-gibbons)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review/)|*Red Dead Redemption 2 is a triumph in world-building, character craft and downright skulduggery. Being bad has never felt so good as Rockstar toe the realism line while still keeping their sharp, trademark tongue in cheek. It's the keen attention to detail where Rockstar succeeds and this outlaw prequel comfortably outperforms their best works and in time, I believe, will be regarded as a once in a generation game.*||
|**Stevivor** \- [Luke Lawrie](http://opencritic.com/critic/3164/luke-lawrie)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-riding-into-the-sunset/)|*Rockstar Games has created a living, breathing world that I am absolutely invested in.*|PS4|
|**Twinfinite** \- [Ed McGlone](http://opencritic.com/critic/77/ed-mcglone)|100 \~ [5 / 5](https://twinfinite.net/2018/10/red-dead-redemption-2-review/)|*Red Dead Redemption 2 has certainly benefited from Rockstar allocating almost a whole generation's worth of development time to perfect what they wanted to accomplish. The result is a game that is easily one of the best games this year, and this console generation, but that's not all. It should eventually go down as one of the greatest games ever made.*|PS4|
|**Gameblog** \- [Gianni Molinaro](http://opencritic.com/critic/3738/gianni-molinaro) \- *French*|100 \~ [10 / 10](http://www.gameblog.fr/tests/3197-red-dead-redemption-ii-ps4)|*There's a new sheriff in the open-world action game genre in town. Red Dead Redemption 2 is sure ambitious but it succeeds everywhere he travels : exploration, gunfights, stealth, main quest, characters, side quests, customization, acting, hunting, fishing... Name one element, it delivers. And it sure looks like one of the best looking games ever seen and has many secrets yet to be discovered. And so it can be considered as a masterpiece, an extraordinary, legendary game that we will talk about with sincere admiration for ages.*|PS4|

Everything also depends on thematic genres and preferences. Maybe not everyone likes the stories of 'Indians and cowboys'.

After countless hours with the game, there's still so many side-quests, collectibles and mysteries to discover. The world might not be Rockstar's biggest, but it certainly feels like its deepest. It feels rich, you're constantly side-tracked with new adventures, as they've truly crafted a world that you want to get lost in, to spend time in and just absorb. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an absolute undisputed classic and a legend in the making, plus with* *Red Dead Online* *on the horizon, it looks like our adventures in the wild west are just beginning.*|PS4|

In a way, they only serve as a reminder of how this world isn't made for perfection. Every single aspect of the game will put you into the very shoes of an outlaw roaming America with his gang as they try to escape the law long enough to make the money needed to disappear for good. It's an epic, memorable and engrossing tale which also elevates the open world genre to new heights with the brand new interaction system, a cast of memorable characters and a ton of high-quality content to play for a long time.*|XB1|

It manages to do all the things survival games have been trying to do while making them interesting and not invasive. It gives players a real sense of playing their role through the honor system and the character skill progression by actions your character performs. And above all, in truest Rockstar fashion, it's one of the best stories in gaming, and Arthur Morgan quickly becomes an even more lovable character than I expected. RDR2's start is slow, measured, but as the layers begin to unfold and the scope of the game's sandbox is known, you see just how impressive it all really is. This is easily a top candidate for one of the greatest open world RPGs of all time.*|PS4|

>In the grand scheme of things, Fallout 4's minor issues pale in comparison to its successes. When you put the controller down, you think about the friend you betrayed to benefit another, the shifting tide of an incredible battle, or the moment you opened a drawer and found someone's discarded effects, making you wonder how they felt before the bombs fell. In moments like these, Fallout 4 can be an intoxicating experience. You're often forced to sacrifice something--a relationship, a lucrative opportunity, or your health--to make gains elsewhere. And the deeper down the rabbit hole you go, the more you wonder: what if I chose a different path? You second guess yourself, not just because you had other options, but because you aren't sure if you did the right thing. The fact that your decisions stick with you after walking away from the game is a testament to the great storytelling on hand. Fallout 4 is an argument for substance over style, and an excellent addition to the revered open-world series.

>Bethesda's open-world strengths have always differed from its contemporaries in that focus on world-building and a sense of place above all else. Fallout 4 has all the ambiance and history that made its predecessors such wonderful places to get lost for hours at a time, with a much more coherent set of stories within it. That Bethesda has integrated a major building and crafting tool while finally building a great-playing game almost feels like a bonus.

[IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review?utm_campaign=ign+main+twitter&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social): 9.5 (Dan Stapleton)

>The world, exploration, crafting, atmosphere, and story of Fallout 4 are all key parts of this hugely successful sandbox role-playing game. Great new reasons to obsessively gather and hoard relics of happier times, strong companions, and sympathetic villains driving tough decisions make it an adventure I’ll definitely replay and revisit. Even the technical shakiness that crops up here and there can’t even begin to slow down its momentum.

[Eurogamer](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-11-09-fallout-4-review): Recommended (Dan Whitehead)

>However, fans - and I count myself among that number - will likely shrug and accept that this is simply how things are in a Bethesda RPG, and it's true that the highs do outweigh the lows. Fallout 4 has given me some of my best gaming memories of 2015, along with some of my most frustrating. These are legacy problems that aren't going away any time soon, and as fun as the settlement crafting is here, I'd gladly do without it for a game engine that offers a more dependable foundation for future adventures. Fallout 4 is a great game. It's also kind of a mess. Caveat emptor.

[PC Gamer](http://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-4-review/): 88 (Phil Savage)

>As a whole, though, it's a loving production. It's filled with care and attention to detail—like the expanded set of radio stations, or the way flash radiation storms bathe the world in a sickly, ominous green hue. It's a pleasure to pick through the world, to discover new sights, and to pick through the perks and customisation option to conceive the perfect character build, however bizarre. In short, many of Fallout 4's problems, like every Bethesda RPG before it, are a consequence of what makes them unforgettable. That might not be the neatest conclusion, but it explains why, 50 hours in, I'm still having fun. It also explains why, now that I've finished this review, I'm going to play it for many hours more.

[Game Informer](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/fallout_4/b/xboxone/archive/2015/11/09/a-familiar-wasteland.aspx): 9 (Andrew Reiner)

>Fallout 4 didn’t blow me away like the previous iteration did, but it did keep me thoroughly entertained and fully vested in journeying across the wasteland. As Bethesda's ""Welcome Home"" marketing campaign teases, when fans of Fallout 3 or New Vegas enter this new world, it'll feel strangely familiar. As one of the top games of the previous generation, this isn't a bad thing at all. Fallout 4 has all of the trappings that can keep you engaged for days on end.

>Which brings me back to the start - pottering around the garage on an in-game day off. Even now, 70 hours in, every time I set out I’m not sure what I’m going to find. My Pip-Boy’s full of missions but sometimes I just pick a direction and walk until something happens. There’s a still a bit of the map I haven’t fully explored, mainly because I always get distracted enroute. There’s a whole world here to discover and even after all the time I’ve spent in it I barely feel like I’ve scratched the surface. Maybe I won't tick everything off the list but just trying to see what’s out there is the real draw - for all the missions, quests and other stuff Fallout 4 contains, by far the most important thing in it are the decisions I’ve made. Few games nail a feeling of total freedom and this is an experience made of nothing but that.

[The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9693246/fallout-4-review-ps4-xbox-pc?utm_campaign=theverge&utm_content=chorus&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter): (Andrew Webster)

>But it’s still very much Fallout — a game that doesn’t really need to change all that much to trigger that familiar mix of dread and joy. A new location and a much better story were enough to pull me into this world, and 60 hours later I’m not done with it. There are settlements I still want to finish building, and crimes I still need to get to the bottom of. At some point I plan to ignore everything altogether, and just wander into the wilderness to see what I can find. Even if I’m alone, at least I’ll have Billie Holiday’s voice to keep me company.

[God is a Geek](http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/fallout-4-review/): 9 (Mick Fraser)

>It’s hard to find genuine fault with what Bethesda has done here beyond the performance issues. They’ve taken everything learned from Fallout 3, New Vegas, and Skyrim and refined it into one huge, intelligent action-adventure movie. It’s more cinematic than you might expect thanks to a clever script and a dynamic chat camera, the combat missions are well thought-out blasts of adrenaline, while the trademark Fallout weirdness makes a welcome return now and then to relieve you of the constant need to fight something. It’s very much your game and your story, and everyone will play it differently simply because there are so many ways to play, and each one feels natural.

>There’s always something to build, somewhere to discover, someone to help ,or something to distract you. Ignore the bugs (if you can) and leap into Fallout 4 with both feet, and you’ll find a game bigger, brighter, deeper, and more personal than anything Bethesda has done before.

[Xbox Achievements](http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/fallout-4/review/): 9 (Dan Webb)

>Fallout 4 might not be as technically advanced as, say The Witcher 3, but it’s a game full of charm and substance, which makes up for an ageing Creation Engine. Fallout 4 boasts an incredible world full of intrigue, mystery and suspense, backed by a whole host of weird and wonderful characters. It’s a world you’re going to want to go back to, time and time again.

[Push Square](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/fallout_4): 9 (Robert Ramsey)

>Fallout 4 is a masterclass in open world design. Consistently engrossing and absolutely stuffed with intricacies, it's a title that'll keep you enthralled for hours at a time as you gradually unravel its desolate yet hopeful post-apocalyptic portrayal of Boston. Although it's let down by some disappointing frame rate issues, it's not enough to detract from what's otherwise one of the most atmospheric and beautifully brutal games on the PS4. Significantly improved combat, a constant wealth of gameplay options, and a heavy emphasis on player choice combine to create an adventure that's truly memorable.

[Game Revolution](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/fallout-4): 4.5/5 (Nick_Tan)

>Fallout 4 is a roaring response to criticism that the series has ignored its qualities as a shooter in favor of its deeper and stronger RPG roots. Nearly every design change in Fallout 4 poises the game as a more streamlined modern shooter with high production value across the truly open-world Commonwealth wasteland. The introduction of settlements, newly designed power armor, and deeper crafting evolve the Fallout franchise for the better. This occasionally comes at the cost of storytelling, however, with a plot based on stringently polarizing factions as well as diminished interaction with characters in general. But despite these missteps, Fallout 4 will only improve with time, assuredly with the assistance of the community and user-created mods, and soundly reclaims the franchise as a forward-thinking series in the industry today.

[Playstation Universe](http://www.psu.com/review/28600/Fallout-4-Review---A-truly-captivating-apocalypse): 9.5 (Neil Bolt)

>There is so much going on in Fallout 4 that your opening moments of unnerving beauty and serenity will inevitably give way to an even more beautiful chaos. From this chaos springs emergent adventures, the struggle for survival, and near-limitless options, all with their own merit. Despite an air of familiarity, I've not been quite this captivated by a game in some time. That’s high praise when considering some of the games that have commanded obsessive hours and play in recent years. Fallout 4 meets one’s expectations of a new installment in impressive fashion. In doing so, it proves to be one of the best games of the generation to date. Say goodbye to life for awhile. The Wasteland is calling you home.

[US Gamer](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/fallout-4-playstation-4-review-brilliant-maddening-and-wholly-memorable/): 4.5/5 (Kat Bailey)

>If you've played a Bethesda RPG, you should have a pretty good idea of what you're in for. Bethesda plays it surprisingly safe with the formula, but they also do a much better job with the story this time around, serving to elevate the game as a whole. While there's no denying that it can be a bit ridiculous at times, its sheer scope speaks for itself. Bethesda has succeeded in crafting yet another fascinating open-world RPG. 

[Rock Paper Shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review-pc/): (Alec Meer)

>52 hours in, would I go back for more? Yes, absolutely. I lived and breathed Fallout 4 for the vast majority of last week and the fact I was mostly having a damn good time meant I did it willingly. It’s glitchy, a little repetitive and over-familiar, and far too heavy on unconvincing combat, but the improved technology (or the budget) means it’s able to realise the dense, detailed, beautiful decay that Fallout 3 did not, and its dramatically better-presented and performed characters means it’s not shooting itself in the foot in the way Oblivion and Skyrim did. The personality gulf between Bethesda games and BioWare games feels a whole lot narrower now. I won’t for one second pretend that it’s what devotees of Fallout 1 and 2 want, but it does feel like the game Fallout 3 tried and, to my mind, failed to be.

>Vibrant and characterful as well as immense, Fallout 4 is the giant leap forwards Bethesda’s RPGs sorely needed in terms of presentation, though the unrelenting focus on routine, lightweight combat sees it fall just short of triumph status.

[Destructoid](http://www.destructoid.com/review-fallout-4-318096.phtml): 7.5 (Chris Carter)

>After spending roughly 40 hours with the game, I can safely place it somewhere in the middle of Fallout 3 and New Vegas in terms of quality. A lot of the franchise's signature problems have carried over directly into Fallout 4, but all of its charms have come along for the ride as well. It manages to do a whole lot right, but the story drags at times, and glitches...glitches never change.

[Escapist](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/14910-Fallout-4-Review-Bethesda-s-Open-World-RPG-Apocalypse#&gid=gallery_5011&pid=1): 4.5/5 (Conrad Zimmerman)

>Whether or not players find other changes displeasing, such as the new dialogue system and its limitations, is likely going to depend on their personal relationship with the Fallout series. Newer players will probably never know what they're missing and are likely to have a fantastic time, while fans who have stuck around may be disappointed with the direction Fallout 4 takes.

[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review-look-upon-my-works-ye-mighty-and-despair/): 8.5 (Paul Tassi)

>In my mind, Fallout 4’s greatest triumph, and its one major point of evolution is in its storytelling, crafting a lengthy, unexpected ending and resolution that I will remember for years to come. It also remains one of the best games in existence for those who simply like to wander and explore and unearth long-buried secrets. But it struggles with archaic gameplay systems and an inflexible engine that anchor the game to the past for all the wrong reasons. Fans may enjoy more Fallout and a brand new map to explore, but this sequel will not be heralded as revolutionary or overly impressive this time around.

[Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/twenty-hours-with-fallout-4-1741409096) - 20 hours with Fallout 4 (Chris Suellentrop)

>I am starting to resent small nuisances, like having to remember to change my clothes to improve my charisma stats before bartering with a shopkeeper. Your companions—whether Dogmeat or others that you meet in the world, whom you can ask to travel with you—seem to frequently get in your way, especially during interior sequences.

>Still, this is a game that seems to be getting better as it goes along. If you value largeness, Fallout 4 sure is big and there’s plenty more to do. I’m just getting my first perks and have settlements to build. Now excuse me, I’m going to go get lost in it. 

[VideoGamer](http://www.videogamer.com/reviews/fallout_4_review.html): 9 (Simon Miller

>The fact of the matter is, though, that this is more of the same, even if that 'same' has been pushed to new heights. If you hated Fallout 3, then there's not much to get you onside here. If you loved it, then you'll love this all the more, because of its differences as well as its similarities. 

[Digital Trends](http://www.digitaltrends.com/game-reviews/fallout-4-review/): 4/5 (Will Fulton)

>Fallout 4’s staler story and oversimplified dialog are relatively minor dings to a largely satisfying whole. Bethesda had two hugely popular games in Fallout 3 and Skyrim. Fallout 4 doesn’t make any radical leaps forward, but it smartly iterates upon the accumulated wisdom of its predecessors. It has simple, smart improvements to combat; companions have more depth; leveling is a more elegant process; and the addition of crafting and settlement building open up entirely new forms of play.

>All in all, Fallout 4 is the best, most polished Bethesda RPG to date. The Commonwealth is expansive, inviting, and a lovely place to explore for a few months.

[Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/fallout-4-review-check-your-next-gen-expectations-at-the-vault-door/): (Sam Machkovech)

>But I wasn’t propelled enough that I would encourage an average quest-loving gamer to take the Fallout 4 dive. We're now in an age where open-world games can forgo plot in favor of such cool stuff as fully fledged crafting systems (Minecraft) or online co-op survival (DayZ, ARK Survival Evolved), or they can take the best stuff of Fallout and Skyrim's pedigree and slap even better plot and acting into it (Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Dragon Age: Inquisition). Fallout 4 peaks at neither of these extremes.

>Series fanatics probably shouldn't cancel their pre-orders, but they should definitely check their expectations about ambition and next-gen series boosts at the radioactive vault's doors.

>The changes made overall may scare series fans, but those who roll with the differences may find a sleeker, deeper, altogether more captivating Fallout than they’ve gotten used to.

>Fallout 4 is something special. Something special indeed.

>No, scratch that.

>It’s downright S.P.E.C.I.A.L.

>Klar, da gibt's weder inszenierte Dialoge wie in The Witcher 3 noch Filmbombast à la Dragon Age - sondern einfach nur Geschichtchen, mit denen Fallout 4 seine großartige Endzeit-Atmosphäre und seinen traditionell morbiden Humor unterfüttert. Brauchbare Beute hingegen gibt's nicht überall zu finden, vor allem auf hohen Levels wartet vielerorts nur Müll. Auch das gehört zum Bethesda-Deal, ein Witcher 3 hat mehr lohnenswerte Schätze zu bieten. In Fallout 4 muss ich danach wirklich lange suchen - doch schon alleine die Hoffnung auf coole Beute hält mich bei der Stange.

The top recommendation from [GTA 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/637dft/what_the_people_who_made_grand_theft_auto_3_are/) thread was Halo 2/3 or Shadowrun (2007) from /u/Armonster. Halo 2 seemed like an interesting game to follow, so I researched it again. I decided to look at everyone from Bungie (and people who are listed as additional support. Even with the many, many, many names below, this is not everyone who worked on the game. Close to 50 additional people worked under Microsoft on everything from PR to testing, and this doesn’t even touch on the voice cast (except a few people who worked at Bungie and also supplied voices). 

 I've decided to break this up into three different categories: still at Bungie, at 343 Industries or Microsoft, and elsewhere. All names in each category are sorted by names.

Now, let's get started

## At Bungie

Salvatori has worked with Bungie over his career, last working on Destiny. He has also worked in audio for Stubbs the Zombie and Disney Guilty Party. **Edit** I listed Salvatori originally as working elsewhere because I couldn't determine if he is a director employee or Bungie or working by contract through TotalAudio.

Force-power diversity, combat animations, beautiful opening zones, clever puzzles, and Jedi-salvation stakes could lead anybody to believe they were in for a Star Wars single-player epic worth investing in. The trouble is, the game begins to run on fumes after those three hours.*|PC|

|[**Polygon**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/87/polygon) \- [Ben Kuchera](https://opencritic.com/critic/1500/ben-kuchera)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/11/15/20965341/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc)|*Jedi: Fallen Order is a flawed, sometimes messy game, but it’s a Star Wars experience I didn’t know I wanted. And after finishing it, I definitely want more.*|XB1|
|[**Gamers Heroes**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes) \- [Johnny Hurricane](https://opencritic.com/critic/6599/johnny-hurricane)|100 \~ [100 / 100](http://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review/)|*Much like what Arkham Asylum did for Batman games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order sets the new standard for Star Wars titles. Not only is it a great Star Wars game, it is also the best game of the year.*|PC|
|[**GamingTrend**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/102/gamingtrend) \- [Ron Burke](https://opencritic.com/critic/483/ron-burke)|95 \~ [95 / 100](https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/the-force-is-strong-with-this-one-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review/)|*Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is an absolute masterpiece. Well paced, written, and executed, the game is Respawn's best thus far.*|PC|
|[**GamesBeat**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/78/gamesbeat) \- [Jeff Grubb](https://opencritic.com/critic/1047/jeff-grubb)|93 \~ [93 / 100](https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/14/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-a-series-defining-adventure/)|*It is the kind of achievement that is only possible when one of the best developers in the world puts all of its might into making something special.

|[**GameSpace**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/464/gamespace) \- [Damien Gula](https://opencritic.com/critic/4314/damien-gula)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.gamespace.com/featured/our-review-of-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/)|*If you are looking for a quintessential Star Wars experience that does not outright saddle you with power, but makes you take the journey to earn and respect that power, Jedi: Fallen Order is worth the time spent in a galaxy far, far away.*|PC|
|[**Hobby Consolas**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas) \- [David Martinez](https://opencritic.com/critic/2884/david-martinez) \- *Spanish*|90 \~ [90 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-ps4-xbox-one-pc-527001)|*Jedi Fallen Order is the game every Star Wars fan has been waiting for. Its level design, exploration and combat mechanics are great, and so is the use of the license. Sadly it is short (from 6 to 10 hours) and graphics feel a bit outdated.*|PS4|
|[**IGN**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign) \- [Dan Stapleton](https://opencritic.com/critic/201/dan-stapleton)|90 \~ [9 / 10](http://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review)|*Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order makes up for a lot of lost time with a fantastic single-player action-adventure that marks the return of the playable Jedi.*|PS4, XB1, PC|
|[**Press Start**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/491/press-start) \- [James Mitchell](https://opencritic.com/critic/3659/james-mitchell)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2019/11/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-fulfilling-all-your-jedi-dreams/)|*Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is the Star Wars game fans have been waiting for. It brings together a strong story, addictive combat and an earnest dedication to recreating that Star Wars magic to offer one of the best Star Wars games in over a decade. It’s an experience that any Star Wars fan can’t afford to miss.*|PS4|
|[**Stevivor**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor) \- [Ben Salter](https://opencritic.com/critic/3160/ben-salter)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review/)|*It’s the blend of all these elements that makes Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order the gripping single-player Star Wars game we have been waiting for all generation. Challenging combat is broken up by platforming and exploration, and it’s all held together by a narrative I genuinely cared about. On their own, none of these elements are going to win awards and are all done better elsewhere, but as a package they form something exciting — much like the Star Wars films.*|XB1|
|[**Saudi Gamer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/455/saudi-gamer) \- [صالح بازرعة](https://opencritic.com/critic/3302/-) \- *Arabic*|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://saudigamer.com/review/stars-wars-jedi-fallen-order/)|*Whether you are a fan of Star Wars movies or not, you will enjoy your time with Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order with its fun gameplay and interesting story.*||
|[**The Games Machine**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/497/the-games-machine) \- [Daniele Dolce](https://opencritic.com/critic/4728/daniele-dolce) \- *Italian*|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-pc-ps4-xbox-one/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-recensione/)|*Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order hits the target by offering the right mix of adrenaline-pumping action and thoughtful exploration. The metroidvania mechanics are grafted to perfection within the game formula, and the same can be said for those borrowed from the latest productions of From Software. Without introducing anything really new, Respawn Entertainment manages to merge all these elements and give birth to a fascinating and satisfying experience, as well as being consistent with the Star Wars ecosystem (much more than the last movies).*||
|[**Atomix**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/458/atomix) \- [Alberto Desfassiaux](https://opencritic.com/critic/3348/alberto-desfassiaux) \- *Spanish*|90 \~ [90 / 100](https://atomix.vg/review-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/)|*I do not know if we are facing the best game with ""Star Wars"" in its name. What I am sure of is that Electronic Arts is finally delivering a worthy game and that it meets not only what fans of this franchise are waiting for, but what every consumer anticipates when paying for an AAA game in 2019.*|PS4|

Raley](https://opencritic.com/critic/4313/garrick-d-raley)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.mmorpg.com/editorials/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-1000014118)|*There are so many aspects of Jedi: Fallen Order that I loved, and I hope we get to see more from Respawn in the future. For now, I think this is the Star Wars game I’ve been looking for.*|PC|
|[**Nexus**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/528/nexus) \- [Robert de Wit](https://opencritic.com/critic/5599/robert-de-wit)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://nexushub.co.za/nexus/review-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order.html)|*Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order delivers a magnificent Star Wars experience that lives up to so many expectations, and then some. The marvelous blend and execution of platforming, challenging combat, and developed characters woven into a singular adventure is simply mesmerizing, unfortunately, marred by some slight hiccups. However, this is a step in the right direction for Star Wars video games, and EA as a whole, as when you give a passionate developer the freedom to explore, they create something truly extraordinary.*||

With a balanced pace and a very measured gameplay for combat, puzzles and platforms, the title knows how to tell a story within the canon that catches from the first moment.*|XB1|
|[**Game Informer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/35/game-informer) \- [Andrew Reiner](https://opencritic.com/critic/1030/andrew-reiner)|88 \~ [8.8 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-a-turbulent-thrill-ride)|*Jedi: Fallen Order tells a new Star Wars story and takes players to new places. It sits nicely alongside the Rebels and Resistance TV shows, which also dare to be different*|XB1|
|[**Spaziogames**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames) \- [Domenico Musicò](https://opencritic.com/critic/3760/domenico-music-) \- *Italian*|88 \~ [8.8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-la-forza-scorre-potente-recensione/)|*Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is indubitably one of the best Star Wars Games. Under the guide of Stig Asmussen, Respawn has created a solid action-adventure game and an exciting original story that fits perfectly in the series universe.*||
|[**GamePro**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro) \- [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) \- *German*|85 \~ [85 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-test,3351264.html)|*Jedi: Fallen Order does not reinvent Star Wars. What it does, it makes it really good. The story, though, could be bolder*|PS4|

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a trip down the memory lane; to the times when I played the best Star Wars games for the very first time. Respawn Entertainment can easily put their game on the same shelf as Jedi Outcast. The Force is strong with this one!*|PS4|

If you love Star Wars and can't wait to restore the Jedi Order, then you will definitely enjoy Cal's journey, otherwise you could be disappointed by a game that, despite a fun gameplay, is not supported by a compelling story or unforgettable characters.*|PS4|

The characters are infectious, and the planet-hopping and Metroidvania game design, once you’ve gained most of your base abilities, is fun and rewarding. The cheeky load times between planets is cleverly masked through your ship’s take off and then jump to hyperspace. It has more than enough nods to the original trilogy, while building on some of its own lore (the Nightsisters are just plain awesome). The game’s numerous biomes are also gorgeous and the acting throughout, alongside the writing, is just excellent. It just feels a bit incomplete where some extra time in QA and then development would have served it much better. The product offered here is good, but not quite as brilliant as it could have been.*||

Even if you strip away the license, you’re left with a super satisfying mix or combat, story, and exploration, deftly crafted by a studio best known for spearheading an entirely different genre.*|PS4|

Still, the intergalactic exploration is seasoned with Metroidvania-lite gatekeeping and combat systems that successfully blend Star Wars flash with Soulslike danger and make the magic happen. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has the spunk of a PS2 game, the game design of a PS3 game, and the scale of a PS4 game. That’s a win in my book.*|PS4|

It borrows heavily from several genres without actually adding anything new to the conversation. That’s not to say it’s bad, it just didn’t leave me wanting to revisit this galaxy.*|XB1|

Actually, looking back at the long history of Star Wars video games, the last time someone attempted a character-driven game in this franchise was The Force Unleashed II, and that was almost a decade ago. And I can't find another Star Wars game in the decades before that which brings together so many different elements and tells a unique story with as much gravity as this one. Now it's up to EA to give Respawn the chance to hammer out as many of these annoying imperfections as it can via post-release updates, and allow Jedi: Fallen Order to take its rightful place in the pantheon of all-time great Star Wars games.*|PS4, XB1|

Reviews
--------------------

**Attack of the Fanboy** - Kyle Hanson - [4 / 5 stars](http://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (PC)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda fails to deliver a compelling plot and the journey to a whole new galaxy offers little that's new or exciting. Still, it does give you the same quality gameplay the series is known for and you'll enjoy your time with your new crew, even if they're no replacement for the originals.

--------------

**CGMagazine** - Chris Carter - [7 / 10](http://www.cgmagonline.com/reviews/mass-effect-andromeda-review-like-expansion/) (XB1)

>At times, Mass Effect: Andromeda can feel like an expansion and not a true follow-up.

--------------

**COGconnected** - Paul Sullivan - [88 / 100](http://cogconnected.com/review/mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (PS4)

>The fantastic combat and strong story points far outweigh the technical missteps and more cringeworthy moments.

--------------

**Destructoid** - Brett Makedonski - [6.5 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-mass-effect-andromeda-424694.phtml) (XB1)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda spends a lot of time not really feeling like a Mass Effect game. If anything, it feels like a spin-off -- the sort of thing created by another studio that's unsure about what direction to take it. Like in the game itself, there are problems with the atmosphere. But Andromeda is very clear that it doesn't aim to be like the other Mass Effects. New beginnings, not funerals -- for better and for worse.

--------------

**GameSpot** - Scott Butterworth - [6 / 10](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mass-effect-andromeda-review/1900-6416638/?ftag=GSS-05-10aaa0b) (PS4)

>In many ways, Andromeda feels like a vision half-fulfilled. It contains a dizzying amount of content, but the quality fluctuates wildly. Its worlds and combat shine, but its writing and missions falter--and the relative strength of the former is not enough to compensate for the inescapable weakness of the latter. As a Mass Effect game, Andromeda falls well short of the nuanced politics, morality, and storytelling of its predecessors. For me, the series has always been about compelling characters and harrowing choices, so to find such weak writing here is bitterly disappointing. Yet even after 65 hours, I still plan on completing a few more quests. The game can't escape its shortcomings, but patient explorers can still find a few stars shining in the darkness.

--------------

**GamesRadar+** - Andy Hartup - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.gamesradar.com/mass-effect-andromeda-review/)

>Andromeda provides an interesting premise and story, but is let down by poor combat, excessive padding, and over-complication

--------------

**Gaming Nexus** - Kinsey Danzis - [8.8 / 10](https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/5352/Mass-Effect-Andromeda/) (XB1)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda doesn’t quite live up to the hype, but it comes close. Considering the situation in which the developers found themselves, they put out an addition to the franchise that really feels like returning home even though you’re millions of light years from Earth. With stunning scenery, a distinct Mass Effect feel, and an abundance of things to do, it’s a worthy investment for any Mass Effect veteran or newcomer—but don’t expect it to be perfect.

--------------

**Hardcore Gamer** - Adam Beck - [3.5 / 5](http://www.hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=251032) (PS4)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda is an unbalanced experience.

--------------

**PC Gamer** - Chris Thursten - [80 / 100](http://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (PC)

>Marred by inconsistency and in need of a polish pass, this vast new sci-fi frontier nonetheless rewards dedicated exploration.

--------------

**PlayStation Universe** - Kyle Prahl - [8 / 10](http://www.psu.com/review/32525/mass-effect-andromeda-review) (PS4)

>Andromeda’s first adventure is plagued by frustrations. But memorable characters, a satisfying story, and deep RPG systems ultimately win the day.

--------------

**Press Start** - James Mitchell - [9 / 10](http://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review-new-generation-mass-effect/) (PS4)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda manages to successfully bring back the sense of exploration and discovery that fans have longed for since the original Mass Effect, whilst honing and improving the already enjoyable combat mechanics of Mass Effect 3. The result is something truly special – a metaphorical slow burn, a hybrid that is sure to appeal to fans of both the original game and its flashier sequels. Despite this, Andromeda is hampered slightly by its lack of visual polish and presentation, which can kill the wonder and fantasy as quickly as it builds it.

--------------

**USgamer** - Kat Bailey - [3 / 5 stars](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/mass-effect-andromeda-review) (PS4)

>Mass Effect Andromeda falls short of its predecessors, but it's still a competently executed open-world action RPG with an interesting world and tons of quests to complete. Its biggest shame is that it doesn't make better use of its setting, opting instead to go with more of the same. Hopefully BioWare will be more ambitious when it comes time for the inevitable sequel.

--------------

**Xbox Achievements** - Richard Walker - [80%](http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/mass-effect-andromeda/review/) (XB1)

>You might initially turn your nose up at Mass Effect: Andromeda, but stick with it and you'll be richly rewarded with a vast space opera that gets better and better. It has problems, but they pale into insignificance once you're swept up in the exploits of Mass Effect: Andromeda's Pathfinder.

--------------

**Stevivor** - Steve Wright - [9.5 / 10](http://stevivor.com/reviews/mass-effect-andromeda-review-already-better-then-shepard/) (XB1)

>Savour the experience, boys and girls, and delight in carefully-placed groundwork that will ensure more adventures to come… and hopefully more for your twin to do.

--------------

**Eurogamer** - Edwin Evans-Thirlwell - [Unscored](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-03-19-mass-effect-andromeda) (PS4)

>It's gripping stuff, and a reminder of the greatness of the Mass Effect trilogy - its intelligent reworkings of pulp sci-fi cliche, the taut splendour of its scenarios and aesthetic, the colour and dexterity of its writing. All that's still in here somewhere, I think. But then you pop out the other end of the mission, back into Andromeda's labyrinth of drudgery and obfuscation, and remember that you're a long way from home.

--------------

**GamingTrend** - Travis Northup - [80 / 100](http://gamingtrend.com/reviews/fainter-stars-mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (XB1)

>Mass Effect Andromeda is a return to the original Mass Effect game in ways both good and bad. Interesting characters, solid gameplay and RPG mechanics, and the revival of the open-world elements of the series will immerse and delight longtime fans. However, wooden characters, a light story, and plenty of glitches hold this title back from fulfilling its full potential.

--------------

**MMORPG.com** - Catherine Daro - [8.7 / 10](http://www.mmorpg.com/mass-effect-andromeda/reviews/i-wanted-mass-effect-4-but-got-something-better-1000000469)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda is a very solid game. BioWare had obviously taken their lessons both from original Mass Effect trilogy as well as Dragon Age series and mixed it with fair dose of experience of other AAA titles of late. It is not Inquisition in space, although the influence of it is clearly seen.

--------------

**RPG Fan** - Derek Heemsbergen - [78%](http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2017/6021.html) (PS4)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda presents plenty of great ideas, but these tend to be either aped too closely from its predecessors or buried under issues that are surmountable yet frustrating all the same.

--------------

**Metro GameCentral** - GameCentral - [6 / 10](http://metro.co.uk/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review-galaxy-of-issues-6520722/) (PS4)

>What could have been an all-time classic action role-player is let down by a surprisingly poor script and unengaging characters.

--------------

**TheSixthAxis** - Dominic Leighton - [8 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (PS4, PC)

>I found it hard to be excited during the opening hours of Mass Effect: Andromeda. It feels too safe, too much like what’s gone before, but then it clicks. There’s a moment where the galaxy opens up and you find yourself embarking once more on a huge mission across compelling, beautifully constructed planets, surrounded by memorable characters. Sadly the glut of technical missteps serve to cheapen proceedings, but this is still an adventure you don’t want to miss out on.

--------------

**PlayStation LifeStyle** - Keri Honea - [6.5 / 10](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review-finding-paths-ps4/#/slide/1) (PS4)

>With the vast love of the Mass Effect series, Andromeda was never going to make people 100% happy, the same way the ME3 ending didn’t make people happy. The BioWare team put so many great things in place, but the main story, the characters, and most of the writing keep the game from being great. Sadly, technical mess keeps it from being good.

--------------

**Shacknews** - Brittany Vincent - [6 / 10](http://www.shacknews.com/article/99465/mass-effect-andromeda-review-in-progress-ruff-ryder) (PC)

>Unfortunately, Mass Effect: Andromeda is a frustrating mess of bad design decisions, bugs, glitches, and narrative missteps. It could have been so much more, but it ends up falling flat on its face. While there are things to enjoy about it, they're few and far between -- your time is much better served replaying the original trilogy or exploring the widely available mods out there. You'll end up being much more fulfilled and feeling as though you've used your time in a productive manner.

--------------

**Polygon** - Arthur Gies - [7.5 / 10](http://www.polygon.com/2017/3/20/14886618/mass-effect-andromeda-review-PS4-Xbox-One-PC) (PS4, XB1)

>But it’s my time with the cast that I’m still thinking about, and the mysteries about the world that haven’t been answered that make me feel like I’m waiting once again for a new Mass Effect game. And if I’m judging a game by where it leaves me, Andromeda succeeds, even if it stumbled getting there.

--------------

**Ars Technica** - Lee Hutchinson - [Early Review](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/early-review-mass-effect-andromeda-is-dragon-age-inquisition-in-space/) (PC)

>If you are a die-hard Mass Effect fan who has a personal Shepard head-cannon, Andromeda is an insta-buy, no questions asked. It's the first Mass Effect game we've gotten in five years and potentially the starting point for a new series. It has many of the same traits that made the original Mass Effect trilogy great, and it feels right. If you’re not a die-hard Mass Effect fan, watch some YouTube videos first to make sure the game will be for you.

--------------

**Post Arcade (National Post)** - Chad Sapieha - [8.5 / 10](http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/post-arcade/mass-effect-andromeda-review-a-galaxy-without-diversity-is-the-ultimate-evil) (PS4)

>But for each hour I spent participating in humdrum combat I spent at least two or three engaged in thought provoking conversation or exploring strange new environments, learning more and more about the fascinatingly complex web of worlds, people, and problems that BioWare’s writers have woven. That’s why I play Mass Effect games. And it’s why Mass Effect: Andromeda, like its predecessors, is a blissfully easy recommendation for anyone looking for more than just another run-of-the-mill shoot ’em up set in space.

--------------

**RPG Site** - Andrea Shearon - [7 / 10](http://www.rpgsite.net/review/5414-mass-effect-andromeda-review) (PS4, PC)

>Ryder’s tale feels like a solid beginning to something new. It needs more than a little polish, and probably some extensive work under the hood, but Andromeda has reassured me Mass Effect can exist without the Citadel, Earth, Shepard or even Ryder. This new galaxy left me with more questions than answers, but I’m okay with that. I hope another entry to the series means more exploration into every corner of humanity’s new home.

--------------

**AngryCentaurGaming** - Jeremy Penter - [Rent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzJc6jo-0XA) (PC)

>This is actually a 'Rent' or 'Deep, Deep Sale' on PC. The game has enough issues that right now there is no way I feel comfortable telling people to run out and get it. Because sure it can offer 60 hours, but I can flick my nuts for 60 hours, but it doesn't mean I want to.

--------------

**IGN** - Dan Stapleton - [7.7 / 10](http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review) (XB1, PS4)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda only occasionally recaptures the series' brilliance, but delivers a vast and fun action-RPG.

--------------

**Forbes** - Paul Tassi - [8.5 / 10](https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review-ps4-every-mans-sky/#77627d1139f0) (PS4)

>I have a feeling that Mass Effect fans will enjoy the game, but I don't think anyone will claim it outclasses the original trilogy, outside of maybe the very first game. If you could combine the story and memorable quests of the originals with the combat, visuals and scope of Andromeda, you would have the perfect video game, though I think what's offered here will satisfy most.

--------------

**Rock, Paper, Shotgun** - John Walker - [Unscored](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (PC)

>As a follow-up to the previous trilogy, it's a timid and tepid tale too heavily reliant on what came before, too unambitious for what could have been, trapped in a gargantuan playground of bits and pieces to do.

--------------

**Digital Trends** - Phil Hornshaw - [2.5 / 5 stars](http://www.digitaltrends.com/game-reviews/mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (PS4)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda often comes off like a giant checklist of Mass Effect–themed content, but what it's missing is the wonder and excitement that made the last Mass Effect games feel special. The previous games had their issues, but combined their elements to create a vast, interesting world full of deep characters with conflicting desires and experiences that made us feel connected to it.

--------------

**Critical Hit** - Geoffrey Tim - [8 / 10](http://www.criticalhit.net/review/mass-effect-andromeda/) (PS4)

>Mass Effect Andromeda is a fresh start – but in borrowing liberally from the first game it’s made many of the same mistakes. In spite of them, it’s an exciting space adventure that delivers everything that’s become important to Mass Effect: Great characters, fun exploration and a climactic tale of good vs evil.

--------------

**Game Revolution** - Aron Garst - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/mass-effect-andromeda) (PS4)

>Although familiar in some regards, this is a positive in Andromeda’s case. Though, a truly successful revival needs to be innovative, not repetitive, and Andromeda often falls into a trap of tedium. It's a shame because it could have been so much more.

--------------

**Fenix Bazaar** - Gaetano Prestia - [8 / 10](https://fenixbazaar.com/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (XB1)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda is an important first step for a franchise looking to enter into a new generation. It might get off on the wrong foot, but some crafty navigation quickly gets it back on track.

>Ultimately, there is a lot of fun to be had here. There are moments here that matter, but this game requires that confluence of idea to really shine, it needs a thesis. Great art needs to tell a story in it, and subjectively if you found something beautiful in this I understand, but there is objectively some problems with this masterpiece that make me want to go back to the Milky Way galaxy, find my crew, and never go to Andromeda.

--------------

**God is a Geek** - Chris White - [8.5 / 10](http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (PS4)

>A welcome return to Bioware’s space opera, introducing great characters, an interesting story and some fantastic designs, always providing things to do.

--------------

**Areajugones** - Antonio Vallejo.T - *Spanish* - [9 / 10](https://areajugones.sport.es/mass-effect-andromeda/analisis/) (PC)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda is a great project by BioWare and it is a stunning experience. Amazing narrative and plot, a true feeling of exploration and a very dynamic combat system. Even though its animations may not be the best ones, this game offers hours and hours of action and entertainment.

--------------

**Arcade Sushi** - Luke Brown - [7 / 10](http://arcadesushi.com/mass-effect-andromeda-review-xbox-one/) (XB1)

>Bioware brought a lot more planets, combat, exploration and mechanics to the table this time around, but more isn't always better. There may be no stronger case for keeping things simple than Mass Effect Andromeda.

--------------

**IGN Spain** - José L. Ortega - *Spanish* - [8.5 / 10](http://es.ign.com/mass-effect-andromeda-ps4/116106/review/mass-effect-andromeda-analisis-para-ps4-xbox-one-y-pc) (PS4)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda is a great game, but far from being perfect. It will satisfy the expectations of the fans but fails on delivering a master piece with errors in almost every aspect of the game.

--------------

**GameInformer** - Joe Juba - [8 / 10](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/mass_effect_andromeda/b/playstation4/archive/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review-game-informer.aspx) (PS4)

>When taken as its own journey (and not in comparison to Shepard’s saga), Mass Effect: Andromeda is fun, and the important parts work. The narrative isn’t astounding, but keeps you invested and drives you forward. The combat is entertaining whether you're in single-player or multiplayer. The crew isn't my favorite, but I like them and they have some good moments. Even with its other problems, these are the largest forces shaping your experience with Mass Effect: Andromeda, and they make it worth playing. At the same time, I was often left looking through a haze of inconveniences and dreaming about the game it could have been.

--------------

**GameMAG** - xtr - *Russian* - [7 / 10](http://gamemag.ru/reviews/mass-effect-4) (PS4)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda has many noticeable problems, including strange animation, ugly characters, logically incomplete quests and numerous minor flaws. But this game offers an interesting main plot, nice RPG system and a huge world where you can explore different planets, solve puzzles, fight giant monsters, uncover secrets of the universe and participate in the colonization of deep space. Of course, this is not the Mass Effect we wanted, but a very large and interesting game, which significantly extends the known universe.

--------------

**GamesBeat** - Jeff Grubb - [55 / 100](http://venturebeat.com/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (PC)

>Games have to fit into our lives, and that's not always fair. Mass Effect: Andromeda might've worked a decade ago on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but it doesn't work in a world that is delivering games like Horizon: Zero Dawn, Nier: Automata, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. In this reality, BioWare's latest role-playing game is old, broken, and often boring.

>Worst of all, it's going to disappoint fans of the Mass Effect series.

--------------

**GamePro** - Rae Grimm - *German* - [87 / 100](http://www.gamepro.de/artikel/mass-effect-andromeda-der-kampf-um-einen-neuanfang,3311375.html) (PS4)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda is a gigantic Sci-Fi epic and brave restart for the series, that doesn't reach the magic of its predecessors.

--------------

**M3** - Niklas Alicki - *Swedish* - [5 / 10](http://m3.idg.se/2.1022/1.678552/mass-effect-andromeda) (XB1)

>Bioware's highly anticipated space adventure sadly fails to deliver on some critical points. Wonky animations, a boring set of characters and so-so story elements have officially de-railed the hype train for Mass Effect: Andromeda.

--------------

**GamePlanet** - Matt Maguire - [8 / 10](http://www.gameplanet.com.au/xbox-one/reviews/g58cf900105c8b/Mass-Effect-Andromeda-review/) (XB1)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda is a paradox: it's both disappointing and excellent. A mammoth title, it delivers tons of great content, but hamstrings itself with a poor first few hours, a few horrible systems, and some uninspired scenarios. Even so, it's pretty great!

--------------

**IGN Italy** - Francesco Destri - *Italian* - [7.8 / 10](http://it.ign.com/mass-effect-andromeda-ps4/123086/review/mass-effect-andromeda-la-recensione) (PS4)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda is disappointing in many aspects (not just the visual ones), even if sci-fi mood, exploration, crafting and multiplayer are well done.

--------------

**GameSpace** - Suzie Ford - [8.5 / 10](http://www.gamespace.com/mass-effect-andromeda/review/) (PC)

>Whether it’s the combat system that is both new and familiar or multiplayer with its improvements or the interesting variety of quests or the epic score that screams Mass Effect, it all gels together into a whole. Ryder’s galaxy is as well-suited to her as the Milky Way was for Shepard. If we’re lucky, there are a lot more adventures in store for Ryder and her crew.

--------------

**LevelUp** - Luis Sánchez - [7.5 / 10](http://www.levelup.com/PC/juegos/324335/Mass-Effect-Andromeda/review) (PC)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda is a game that forgot how to be a Mass Effect game. While it fails to deliver a compelling narrative and has little to offer, It’s the combat and planetary exploration the element that holds together this contrasting experience. The result is a game drifting away in the open and cold space.

--------------

**DualShockers** - Giuseppe Nelva - [7.5 / 10](http://www.dualshockers.com/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review-roller-coaster-one-way/) (PS4)

>Perhaps Mass Effect Andromeda will serve as a wake-up call for BioWare, letting them realize that it’s time to evolve beyond the change of  setting and cast. In the meanwhile, we’re still given a game that might not be the monumental fresh start that the masses expected, but is still a quite solid experience than many will enjoy.

--------------

**Atomix** - Alberto Desfassiaux - *Spanish* - [85 / 100](http://atomix.vg/review-mass-effect-andromeda/) (PS4)

>Despite its problems with the facial animations, Mass Effect Andromeda is a great entry of one of the must beloved franchises of all time. Great side quests, a compiling story, memorable characters, a solid combat system, decisions that matters and a deep atmosphere, makes this game a must have to every SciFi fan.

--------------

**GamingBolt** - Rashid Sayed - [8 / 10](http://gamingbolt.com/mass-effect-andromeda-review) (PS4)

>Despite its vague links to the trilogy, Mass Effect: Andromeda can largely be described as a soft reboot for the series. For the most part, this has worked out really well for Bioware, giving them a launching pad to take the story ahead in future installments. The game is not without its problems, but the wealth of content on offer here will suck you right into the experience.

--------------

**We Got This Covered** - Edward Love - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (PS4)

>Good? Yes. Great? No. This new Mass Effect is full of stuff to do, but it's a game that's been designed by consensus, not conviction.

--------------

**PCMag** - Gabriel Zamora - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.pcmag.com/review/352518/mass-effect-andromeda-for-pc) (PC)

>Despite its rougher edges, Mass Effect: Andromeda is a fine third-person shooter that features terrific space exploration. If you can overlook the clunky menus and graphics issues, you're in for some fun space hijinks.


--------------

**Kotaku** - Patricia Hernandez - [Unscored](http://kotaku.com/mass-effect-andromeda-the-kotaku-review-1793496930) (PS4)

>Nobody anticipated how much work building a new home would really take, and in a way, the entire game is about mitigating everyone’s disappointment. The truth is that Andromeda itself isn’t the promised land players hoped for either, but there is a lot that’s good in this flawed new frontier for Mass Effect. The question is: will you play long enough to find it?

--------------

**Generación Xbox** - Felipe Ubierna - [9.2 / 10](http://generacionxbox.com/analisis-de-mass-effect-andromeda/) (XB1)

>After 5 long years of waiting, Mass Effect returns in a big way with a new title that meet our expectations. A more polished combat system, good RPG elements, an intriguing plot and a high level secondary missions that lay the foundations of this new story. It does not reach the perfection, but it is one of the best games that we have been able to play this generation.

--------------

**GamePlanet** - Chris Brown - [7 / 10](http://www.gameplanet.com.au/pc/reviews/g58d1cb40106be/Matts-Incorrect-An-Editor-Our-PC-review-of-Mass-Effect-Andromeda/) (PC)

>Judged purely on its own merits, Mass Effect: Andromeda is a good game. But this is BioWare, and Mass Effect being merely good feels like a failure. It's a little clumsy in places, and daft in others, but I found it mostly endearing despite these quirks.

--------------

**Oyungezer Online** - Utku Çakır - *Turkish* - [5 / 10](http://oyungezer.com.tr/haber/48167-mass-effect-andromeda-inceleme) (PC)

>Mass Effect Andromeda is a souless and a poor game that gets overwhelmed by the success of its predecessor. It's bug filled gameplay, non-inspired storytelling and horrible animation quality makes it one of the the biggest disappointments of all time. Will we ever see a new Mass Effect game? To be honest I couldn't care less after Andromeda.

--------------

**Cheat Code Central** - Lucas White - [3 / 5](http://www.cheatcc.com/ps4/rev/masseffectandromedareview.html) (PS4)

>There's a decent game in here somewhere, but Mass Effect: Andromeda feels like a collaboration from Mass Effect fans rather than a group of known and established developers.

--------------

**GameSkinny** - Synzer - [9 / 10 stars](http://www.gameskinny.com/e27ra/mass-effect-andromeda-review-a-new-frontier) (XB1)

>The negativity around the game baffles me, because I have had an overwhelmingly positive experience with it. I guess that's why they're called opinions. If you are a fan of Mass Effect, RPGs, or open-world games, this is one to pick up. 

--------------

**Push Square** - Robert Ramsey - [6 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/mass_effect_andromeda) (PS4)

>Mass Effect deserves better than Andromeda. The series has stumbled into a new generation, weighed down by tedious open world tropes and a catalogue of performance issues on the PS4. That said, it's not quite the disaster that some would have you believe. There really is a good Mass Effect game here, complete with endearing characters and great combat, but it's buried beneath a mountain of unnecessary clutter. In time, patches may sort many of its problems out, but until then, we can only recommend Andromeda to the BioWare faithful.

--------------

**PCGamesN** - Kirk McKeand - [8 / 10](https://www.pcgamesn.com/mass-effect-andromeda/mass-effect-andromeda-pc-review) (PC)

>If you look at it as a reboot, a starting point for the series, there's lots of promise in that future. The first Mass Effect had countless problems, far more than here, but that will always be remembered as a classic, despite leaving similar threads hanging. Ultimately, this is a story about laying the foundations of a civilization, and it feels like BioWare were doing the same for the future of the franchise. In that way, these RPG developers have become Pathfinders themselves.

--------------

**GameCrate** - Nicholas Scibetta - [7.4 / 10](https://www.gamecrate.com/reviews/review-mass-effect-andromeda-good-game-spread-too-thin/15838) (PC)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda manages to feel both overloaded with content and spread too thin. There are great battles to be won, puzzles to solve, and satisfying social interactions, but they're hidden behind layers of presentation problems and tedious travel times.

--------------

**SA Gamer** - Garth Holden - [8 / 10](http://sagamer.co.za/xbox/review-mass-effect-andromeda-xbox-one) (XB1)

>Get ready for a whole new galaxy and more problems than you can shake a soap opera at.

--------------

**EGM** - Ray Carsillo - [6 / 10](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (XB1)

>There is a strong core of characters and story bedrock laid down in Mass Effect: Andromeda, but between questionable design choices, boring missions, and glitches galore, it’s hard not to view BioWare’s journey to a brand new galaxy as anything less than mission failure.

--------------

**NZGamer** - Keith Milburn - [7 / 10](http://nzgamer.com/reviews/2588/mass-effect-andromeda.html) (PC)

>Exhilarating combat, marred by awkward interactions and pervasive bugs.

--------------

**Guardian** - Jordan Erica Webber - [3 / 5 stars](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/23/mass-effect-andromeda-game-review-galaxy-problems)

>Problems are inevitable in a game of such epic proportions but there is a lot here that will make you want to keep playing

--------------

**GBATemp** - Austin Trujillo - [5.9 / 10](http://gbatemp.net/review/mass-effect-andromeda.572/) (PC)

>They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. In Andromeda, I was beholden to beautiful environments and robust gameplay, yet marred by inhuman animations and a story more loose than spare change in a long woolen sock. Andromeda is a galaxy of empty promises and one I could not find enjoyment in.

--------------

**The Escapist** - Ron Whitaker - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/17493-Mass-Effect-Andromeda-Review) (PC)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda is a game that takes few risks and pushes few boundaries. It's a Mass Effect game designed to make fans of the series feel at home, but technical issues and lackluster writing leave it feeling like a missed opportunity to regain the prestige the franchise once enjoyed.

--------------

**Azralynn** - Azralynn - [79 / 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcyzwQlNSZw) | [*Written*](http://www.azralynn.com/review-mass-effect-andromeda-game/) (PC)

>Andromeda builds on most of the things I liked in the earlier Mass Effect games and exceeds at creating more satisfying gameplay mechanics. It's a real shame that the game didn't get more polish in the character animation department, but if you can look past all these issues there's still plenty of fun to be had with it. 

--------------

**VGChartz** - Brandon J. Wysocki - [Unscored](http://www.vgchartz.com/article/267751/mass-effect-andromeda-xone/) (XB1)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda is like a good book that you don’t want to put down, nor do you want it to end. The litany of complaints and problems are little typos or creases in the pages. You’d be hard pressed to miss them, but you gladly look past them to continue the stellar experience.

--------------

**Cerealkillerz** - Gabriel Bogdan - *German* - [7.5 / 10](http://cerealkillerz.org/mass-effect-andromeda-ps4-review-eine-actionreiche-parodie-der-serie/) (PS4)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda is an action-packed parody of the previous titles. Besides countless technical issues it feels like the developers really don't know where to take the series. If you're looking for a thrilling story or thoughtful dialogues, you'll probably be disappointed. Action-Fans will still get some carefully thought out Gameplay-mechanics and a fun multiplayer-part.

--------------

**Worth Playing** - Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus - [7 / 10](http://worthplaying.com/article/2017/3/24/reviews/102953/) (PS4)

>At the end of the day, Mass Effect: Andromeda isn't bad so much as it is disappointing. The core gameplay has been improved from Mass Effect 3, and the multiplayer is almost worth the price of admission on its own. Alas, it's dragged down by a weak presentation, poor plot, and a general lack of ambition.

--------------

**Gamerheadquarters** - Jason Stettner - [7 / 10](http://articles.gamerheadquarters.com/review569masseffectandromeda.html) (XB1)

>I look forward to the next entry, but there are steps needed to bring Mass Effect back to its proper form.

--------------

**ZTGD** - Ken McKown - [8 / 10](http://www.ztgd.com/mass-effect-andromeda/review/) (XB1)

>Mass Effect Andromeda is a great game with some serious side effects.

**IBTimes UK** - Holly Nielsen - [3 / 5 stars](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/mass-effect-andromeda-review-biowares-beloved-sci-fi-series-awakens-cryo-sleep-flawed-still-1612878) (XB1)

>To the credit of BioWare, despite Andromeda's many flaws I still wanted to visit the planets with my teammates, to progress and colonise new worlds. It is a solid game, but one with issues that appear worse than they are due to high expectations the developers have earned from a stellar history of better RPGs. Would I be thrilled about the prospect of another game set in the Andromeda galaxy? Probably not. However, if future games can push past the familiar and embrace ideas of the ""unknown"" that Andromeda aspires to, but never realises, then I do think the series still has something to offer.

--------------

**Game Rant** - Denny Connolly - [4 / 5 stars](https://gamerant.com/mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (XB1)

>Mass Effect: Andromeda starts out just a bit too slow, but is sure win over fans of sci-fi action RPGs once the real open-world space exploration begins.

--------------

**Gadgets 360** - Pranay Parab - [8 / 10](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/mass-effect-andromeda-review-1674045) (PS4)

>There are several annoyances with the game, but, overall, BioWare has delivered yet another stellar role-playing experience with a fascinating story to boot.

--------------

**Pause Resume** - Craig Shields - [3 / 5](http://www.pauseresume.com/mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (PS4)

>Andromeda isn’t the return to form for Mass Effect that we were hoping for. Its issues are obvious from the opening few hours and if you can manage to accept them, Andromeda is capable of providing an interesting and combat heavy RPG.

--------------

**Use A Potion** - Daryl Leach - [8 / 10](http://www.useapotion.com/2017/03/27/mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (PS4)

>I have no doubt that it’ll probably be one of the most divisive titles released this generation, but for me it certainly delivered on its promise of providing a compelling, action-packed adventure.

--------------

**Brash Games** - DjMMT - [8 / 10](http://www.brashgames.co.uk/2017/03/28/mass-effect-andromeda-review-ps4/) (PS4)

>It is not the best the franchise has to offer but it’s definitely a great start to a whole new trilogy and I highly recommend it to both veteran players and those who have never played Mass Effect before.

--------------

**GameSpew** - Richard Seagrave - [7 / 10](http://www.gamespew.com/2017/03/mass-effect-andromeda-review/) (XB1)

>Once you get over the fact that it’s not quite as polished as its predecessors nor does it further the series in any meaningful way though, you can still appreciate what it is: a Mass Effect game through and through.

--------------

**Giant Bomb** - Brad Shoemaker - [2 / 5 stars](https://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mass-effect-andromeda-review/1900-762/) (PS4)

>Andromeda largely feels like a shoddily assembled facsimile of the previous Mass Effect games.

-If you want to experience the whole *Kingdom Hearts* series in its entirety and in the best possible way, then you need to play all of the titles mentioned in the ""*All Kingdom Hearts titles (only including the most recent versions/remakes/remasters of each title)*"" sections. To get the best and most rewarding experience that doesn't spoil plot twists and revelations, then you need to play all of those titles in release order. Except play *Kingdom Hearts Re:coded* after *Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix*. If you've already played most of the games and want to go for a second round and want a new way of experiencing the series, then you would play all of those titles in chronological order.

**In order to get all of these titles in their best versions possible, then all you need to get are these titles:**

* *Kingdom Hearts HD I.5 + II.5 ReMIX*
* *Kingdom Hearts HD II.8 Final Chapter Prologue*
* *Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days*
* *Kingdom Hearts Re:coded*
* *Kingdom Hearts χ[chi]*
* *Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross]*
* *Kingdom Hearts III*

**Explanations:**

-*Kingdom Hearts HD I.5 + II.5 ReMIX* is a collection of *Kingdom Hearts* titles that includes an HD remaster of *Kingdom Hearts Final Mix*, a movie made out of HD remastered cutscenes from *Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days*, an HD remaster of *Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories*, an HD remaster of *Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix*, an HD remaster of *Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix*, and a movie made out of HD remastered cutscenes from *Kingdom Hearts Re:coded*. It's for the PlayStation 4.

-As it was just stated, *Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days* and *Kingdom Hearts Re:coded* are included in *Kingdom Hearts HD I.5 + II.5 ReMIX*. *But*, they are only cutscene movies. To experience those titles in the best possible way, you need to play the original games on the Nintendo DS, as well as watch the cutscene movies.

-*Kingdom Hearts HD II.8 Final Chapter Prologue* is a collection of *Kingdom Hearts* titles that includes *Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance HD*, *Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A fragmentary passage-*, and *Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover*. It's for the PlayStation 4.

-*Kingdom Hearts χ[chi]* was a Japanese-only browser game that is now discontinued. So, in order to experience this title, you can watch all of the story-related cutscenes translated to English in the YouTube playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh_MX018mXa_RWCWLQlKV1SFxwAla2nie). You can also watch a full English translated playthrough in the YouTube playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhcSrKyqhfh5gWWmRv4rISACTyrZbPPsS).

-*Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross]* is essentially a rebranding of *Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ*. You don't have to get *Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ*, because by getting *Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross]*, you are getting *Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ*, since it's a part of the title. They renamed the app to ""*Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross]*"" to help promote the ""season two"" of the game, which is titled ""*Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross]*.""

-*Kingdom Hearts III* is the name of an upcoming game for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It will be the end of the *Dark Seeker Saga*, which all other games listed here are a part of as well.

**Notes:**

-For those who might be confused, yes, *Kingdom Hearts χ[chi]*, *Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ*, *Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover*, and *Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross]* are all different titles. They are not remakes or remasters of each other. *Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ* is a sequel to *Kingdom Hearts χ[chi]*. *Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross]* is a rebranding of *Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ*, as well as the name of the ""season two"" of the game. *Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover* is a movie that tells some of the story of *Kingdom Hearts χ[chi]*, but through the perspective of different characters. These things makes all of these separate *Kingdom Hearts* titles.

-I only explained how you experience the *Kingdom Hearts* series in the it's fullest and the *best possible way*, which assumes that the person interested in doing so has a PlayStation 4, a Nintendo DS, an iOS or Android smartphone, and a way to watch YouTube videos. I did this because you simply can't experience the *Kingdom Hearts* series in it's fullest and the best possible way without these things. But, if you don't have a few of these things, then I made sure to provide enough information for the reader to be able to figure out what they're able to get in order to experience the *Kingdom Hearts* series in the best way that they're personally able to do.

-For those wondering, I put *Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A fragmentary passage-* after *Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance* chronologically because the majority of the game is technically a flashback. The parts that aren't a flashback take place after *Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance*.

-If any of this confuses you, I'll be happy to help and explain anything further in the comments.

-*Kingdom Hearts III* might not be the 13th *Kingdom Hearts* game, but it's the 13th *Kingdom Hearts* title. Nice job Nomura. This makes me think that one of the sole reasons for rebranding *Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ* to *Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross]* was to make this happen lol

**Non-canon spin-off *Kingdom Hearts* titles in release order:**

* *Kingdom Hearts V CAST*
* *Kingdom Hearts Mobile*
* *Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days Magical Puzzle Clash*
* *Kingdom Hearts Re:coded Gummiship Studio*

**Explanations:**

-*Kingdom Hearts V CAST* is a game for V Cast (Verizon Wireless's broadband service).

-*Kingdom Hearts Mobile* is a game for Docomo Prime Series-P-01A cell phones. It was also available for browser.

-*Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days Magical Puzzle Clash* was a browser flash game.

And Kingdom Hearts 3, the culmination of more than a decade and a half of games, fares much worse than the previous entries did with keeping up and keeping us engaged.*|PS4|
|[**Kotaku**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/276/kotaku) **-** [Tim Rogers](https://opencritic.com/critic/1324/tim-rogers)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-iii-the-kotaku-review-5113989)|*What I’m saying is, Kingdom Hearts III kinda sucks and that’s why I love it. If Kingdom Hearts III kills you, you will at least not die hungry. 32 hours of total mainline campaign gameplay. 4K and 60fps most of the time on Xbox One X. Video games forever.*|XB1|
|[**Eurogamer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer) **-** [Chris Schilling](https://opencritic.com/critic/229/chris-schilling)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-01-29-kingdom-hearts-3-review)|*Overwrought, unsatisfying storytelling takes the shine off a gorgeous and ambitious finale.*|PS4|
|[**GameXplain**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/315/gamexplain) **-** [GameXplain](https://opencritic.com/outlet/315/gamexplain)|Mind-Blowing \~ [Mind-Blowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFKGxHXE-60)|*This game met and exceeded what I hoped for time and time again. I loved exploring each world. The combat was satisfying throughout. The story is well-paced and mostly accessible to newcomers while still satisfying to this long-time fan. And the presentation is astounding. Every element comes together beautifully to create not just my favorite Kingdom Hearts game in the series, but something that's absolutely mind-blowing to me. It is that good. It was worth the wait. And I hope there are those new to the series that will give it a chance.*|PS4|
|[**Hobby Consolas**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas) \- [Álvaro Alonso](https://opencritic.com/critic/3755/-lvaro-alonso) \- *Spanish*|95 \~ [95 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-kingdom-hearts-iii-ps4-xbox-one-363107)|*This is it, the epic, emotional and satisfying conclusion to one of gaming most beloved series. Kingdom Hearts III is everything we could had hoped for (and even more), but it's biggest achievement is that, even by today's standards, it's a one of a kind experience that can only be described using one word: magic.*|PS4|
|[**Game Informer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/35/game-informer) \- [Kimberley Wallace](https://opencritic.com/critic/1028/kimberley-wallace)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/kingdom-hearts-iii/a-main-attraction-worth-waiting-for)|*With higher stakes, Kingdom Hearts III is a lot of spectacle in the best way possible. It isn't afraid to go big, but it also doesn't forget what made fans fall in love in the first place*|PS4|
|[**The Games Machine**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/497/the-games-machine) **-** [Danilo Dellafrana](https://opencritic.com/critic/3695/danilo-dellafrana)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/kingdom-hearts-iii/kingdom-hearts-3-recensione-ps4-xbox-one/)|*Kingdom Hearts 3 succeeds in the difficult task of being up to the expectations, without shaking up its foundations but improving on the strengths of the previous chapters. Spectacular in the artistic direction, exhilarating in the fights and fulfilling on the narrative side, to be fully appreciated Kingdom Hearts 3 requires however that its public is aware of the intricate background of the saga. After waiting for so many years, recommending the last adventure of Sora, Donald and Goofy would only be a negligible formality.*|PS4, XB1|
|[**Press Start**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/491/press-start) \- [Kieron Verbrugge](https://opencritic.com/critic/4101/kieron-verbrugge)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2019/01/25/kingdom-hearts-iii-review-astonishing-new-heights/)|*Kingdom Hearts III takes the series to astonishing new heights. With exhilarating combat, fantastic Disney worlds and a smart approach to an unavoidably convoluted story, it does everything it needs to not only please hardcore fans but anyone up for a solid action JRPG. Against all odds, this might be the perfect Kingdom Hearts game.*|PS4|
|[**GamesBeat**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/78/gamesbeat) \- [Mike Minotti](https://opencritic.com/critic/1057/mike-minotti)|90 \~ [90 / 100](https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/24/kingdom-hearts-iii-review-excessive-yet-satisfying/)|*The Disney side is still the best side of Kingdom Hearts, and Kingdom Hearts III nails that part. But even its story, as ridiculous as it is, gives fans emotional moments and satisfaction. I wouldn't say it's better than Kingdom Hearts or Kingdom Hearts II, but Kingdom Hearts III is magical enough to resonate with this big Disney geek.*|PS4|
|[**USgamer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/66/usgamer) \- [Caty McCarthy](https://opencritic.com/critic/2089/caty-mccarthy)|90 \~ [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/kingdom-hearts-3-review)|*For all the new in Kingdom Hearts 3, there is plenty of the old too. The action combat is more satisfying than it's ever been, even if it's a tad easy to skate through the main storyline. For longtime fans of the series, all those emotional payoffs that have been building for 17 years await. For newcomers, buckle up: because you're in for a wild ride of bonkers Disney interactions and some exciting boss battles.*|PS4|
|[**IGN Italy**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/477/ign-italy) \- [Alessandra Borgonovo](https://opencritic.com/critic/3960/alessandra-borgonovo) \- *Italian*|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://it.ign.com/kingdom-hearts-iii-ps4/150162/review/kingdom-hearts-iii-la-recensione)|Visually stunning, Kingdom Hearts III is all about being cool while delivering us the best conclusion for a long-time series.|PS4|

It has some problems that could have been ironed out, but it still a great and magical experience that can be enjoyed by fans and newcomers alike. It was worth the long wait.*|PS4|

Despite all of the absurd twists and turns, the character missteps and the complete lack of some series-defining cast members, there are very few creations out there that make me smile this often.*|PS4|

[Gamespot](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-review/1900-6416224/) 10/10

>Every fan of Metal Gear has their favorite game in the series. For some, it's the unique gameplay quirks, memorable set pieces, or specific plot points that dictate their adoration for one game over another. When defining the best Metal Gear game, things get trickier, but with The Phantom Pain, that problem is finally resolved. There has never been a game in the series with such depth to its gameplay, or so much volume in content. The best elements from the past games are here, and the new open-world gameplay adds more to love on top. When it comes to storytelling, there has never been a Metal Gear game that's so consistent in tone, daring in subject matter, and so captivating in presentation. The Phantom Pain may be a contender for one of the best action games ever made, but is undoubtedly the best Metal Gear game there is.

[IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-review) 10/10

>The Phantom Pain is the kind of game I thought would never exist - one where every minute gameplay detail has true purpose. Its lack of story focus is sure to be divisive for the Metal Gear faithful, but the resulting emphasis on my story, my tales of Espionage Action, easily make it my favorite in the series. There have certainly been sandbox action games that have given me a bigger world to roam, or more little icons to chase on my minimap, but none have pushed me to plan, adapt, and improvise the way this one does. Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain doesn’t just respect my intelligence as a player, it expects it of me, putting it in league that few others occupy.

[God is a Geek](http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-review/) 10/10

>You would struggle to be disappointed by Metal Gear Solid V. Almost everything is close to perfect, and visually this is one of the most realistic games I have ever seen (especially the environments). The gameplay never gets old and there is so much choice that no two playthroughs will ever be the same. It isn’t only Metal Gear fans who should be interested in this, everyone should be interested in this whether you have played anything like it before or not. Quite simply, this isn’t just the best Metal Gear game, nor is it just the best stealth game, it is one of the best games ever made.

***

[Respawn Ninja](http://respawn.ninja/2015/08/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-review/) 10/10

>Metal Gear Solid: The Phantom Pain is quite possibly (more than likely) the last hurrah from Kojima in this franchise and from the level of detail, the brilliant cinematography style missions to the massive expansion of gameplay with Mother Base management – he’s going out with a bang. The introduction of the game was really powerful and basically took that level of momentum throughout the entire campaign. It’s incredible to see the amount of work gone into this title and you can see Kojima and the team really poured their soul into this game to give it character. This is simply one of the best games I’ve played this year.

>For a series that has been around since 1987 to constantly reinvent itself and stay relevant is an accomplishment in itself. But to totally break what you expect a game can do for you emotionally & mentally – and at the end of the day have fun with it and give you legitimate joy – is something special.

>Bursting with an astounding array of content, amazingly deep gameplay and an engrossing story, The Phantom Pain is the best Metal Gear game to date. It’s a masterpiece, oozing with Kojima’s creative genius. He’s listened and learned, crafting a game that’s as close to perfection as you can get. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry and, as the credits roll, you’ll sit there in disbelief. I certainly did. Either way, you’ll agree that The Phantom Pain is one very special game. If this is to be Kojima’s last Metal Gear game, what a way to sign off. It’s so damn good. No exaggeration, one of the best games ever made.

>Kojima redefines the stealth-action genre showing a V for Victory. Good decisions, clear direction, deep gameplay, extremely polished... MGSV writes one of the most important chapters in the Metal Gear franchise.

>These niggles aside, MGSV is a tremendous piece of work and is one of the best anecdote generators I’ve ever played. Perhaps MGSV’s best quality is how in pulling gameplay to the foreground and letting much of the exposition remain optional, it opens it up to be enjoyed by people who have in the past been put off by its weirdness, serving as both the perfect entry point and a satisfying conclusion. MGSV takes the best of a great series and creates a series’ best in the process.

>It’s difficult to effectively describe everything this game has to offer. It’s difficult to think about the next time we see a new Metal Gear Solid and when that will be. It is, however, not difficult to say that Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is the best game of the year so far.

[The Daily Dot](http://www.dailydot.com/geek/metal-gear-solid-v-phantom-pain-review/) 5/5

>Aside from being a mildly engrossing troop management feature, Mother Base acts as a narrative precursor to Big Boss’ Outer Heaven fortress. It’s just one of a number of key elements in The Phantom Pain that adds gravitas to the events that preceded this chapter in Big Boss’ stor—and the known Metal Gear-related incidents that have yet to come. It takes talent to make the player think that a game director is “phoning in” a story only to realize later that every narrative beat had some degree of meaning. It’s only when I completed the story that I realized that every scene that made me rub my chin in puzzlement is a proverbial breadcrumb that offers a new perspective upon second viewing. A couple revelations are even significant enough to make one rethink the series as a whole. This is one of those rare instances where marathoning a game series is more meaningful after the latest sequel is released, not before.

>Even Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain’s missteps show a certain boldness that is absent from the big budget games space. It is unafraid to experiment, not just on the franchise’s structure, but on mechanics readily established as standards in the industry. Delivering the most realized open-world stealth game to date in addition to the customizability for players to approach every challenge however they see fit, The Phantom Pain not only changes the rules of the Metal Gear Solid series, ultimately altering the trajectory of the franchise, if it does continue, while simultaneously changing the idea of what can be accomplished with an open world game, both narratively and mechanically.

[Playstation Universe](http://www.psu.com/review/27916/Metal-Gear-Solid-V--The-Phantom-Pain-PS4-Review/?page=2) 9.5/10

>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a compelling, sprawling and often jaw-dropping experience that truly brings the franchise into the open-world setting for the first time. Featuring the series’ best stealth gameplay to date, the game is marred only by the odd bland visuals dotted throughout an otherwise beautifully detailed sandbox. If this is indeed Kojima-san’s last Metal Gear Solid title, then take comfort that the Phantom Pain is unequivocally the best game in the series to date.

[GameTrailers](http://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/cy43vw/metal-gear-solid-v--the-phantom-pain-review) 9.3/10

>Make no mistake, though, the Phantom Pain is excellent. It expands and enriches Metal Gear Solid without compromising the qualities that make the series so beloved. Despite the huge scope, hollywood talent, and technical flashiness, there’s a subtlety to the Phantom Pain that’s truly captured our hearts. Even now we’re still turning its events over and over again in our minds. So rarely do game stories demand so much consideration. Decades later, it’s incredible that Metal Gear can still captivate, inspire, and amaze. The Phantom Pain is another significant addition to an enduring legacy.

>Hideo Kojima’s original Metal Gear was a top-down, screen-by-screen stealth title. Compared to the massive and ambitious world of The Phantom Pain, it’s hard to believe both games are products of the same creative mind. A series can’t survive this long without evolving, and The Phantom Pain is a testament to the importance of taking risks. An open world, a customizable base, a variable mission structure – these are not traditional aspects of Metal Gear, but they are what makes The Phantom Pain such an exceptional game. The gameplay, storytelling, and protagonists in Metal Gear may shift with each new installment, but Kojima’s ability to surprise and enthrall gamers remains unchanged.

>The Phantom Pain is an unusual Metal Gear experience, one that not everybody may enjoy if they cling to systems of old. If they’re willing to adapt and accept this new way of exploring Kojima’s world however, they are going to be blown away, absolutely, and one hundred percent guaranteed. This new open world is one that is begging to be played with, in whatever way a player wishes.

>Despite the fact that I hit a few snags along the way, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain feels like a simultaneous celebration of the series, and a decidedly new chapter. It's equal parts tough and flashy, and it's fitting that if this is Kojima's last Metal Gear, he goes on a high note.

>I must also praise Kojima for offering up a game that is not simply engaging and cinematic, but is one that also grants the player some agency in how the story plays out. From the start, I was hooked, despite this being my first foray into the Metal Gear franchise. That being said, while the game serves as a sequel to Ground Zeroes, it works equally just as well as a standalone.

>We could talk about it for hours and gush over the different aspects of the game at great lengths, but it would not change anything to the fact that Metal Gear Solid V : The Phantom Pain is a success and has to be discovered by the player themselves rather than to be explained lengthily. It is a perfect example of a game series somewhat constrained by its original model, and whose deep plot makes it elitist, deciding to change everything and transitioning to a welcoming and varied open world. This change of rules is profoundly disruptive to the series' codes, whether in relation to the gameplay, the narrative rhythm, and even when it comes to the length of the game, which spans well over thirty hours for ""normal players"" and exceeding fifty for completionists. It may not be the Metal Gear Solid V fans were hoping for, true, because several elements are downplayed to better suit the new approach of the game (there is no boss squad, cutscenes are few...). Nonetheless, this is a game fans of the series will enjoy completing, and newcomers will love discovering. The gaming world can thank Hideo Kojima.

>I've still not finished MGS5, despite pouring nearly 40 hours or so into it. Its low points are few yet jarring, and while they come nowhere close to cancelling the highs – of which there are many – they nonetheless stick out. Still, I'm confident in calling Metal Gear Solid 5 the best game of the year, a vast undertaking where Kojima's reach hasn't exceeded his grasp, a game where a big story doesn't happen to you. Instead, you happen to it, slowly but surely. You may be surprised who you end up becoming.

>People expect their sequels to be bigger, better, and more complex than what has come before, while also demanding they stay true to what they know and love. Metal Gear Solid V is one of those rare occasions where a game threads the needle between those two somewhat contradictory expectations, to great effect. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a great example of how to expand a well-loved franchise without destroying what made it so special in the first place. Buy It.

>The dense zaniness that has defined Metal Gear seems to have been largely transposed from the story to your moment to moment actions, and to a vast open world that's surprisingly taut and refined, coursed with rich strategy that plays both on and off the field. Metal Gear Solid 5 is a different type of open world game, then, and a different type of Metal Gear game. After playing through a chunk of the Phantom Pain's campaign, there's every reason to think that Kojima's last entry in the series may well be his best yet.

>After more than 30 hours with the newest Metal Gear Solid, I’m convinced that Phantom Pain is the best Metal Gear yet, a game with extraordinary scope, inimitable style, and some of the most satisfying sneaking and creeping I’ve ever performed either in a video game or IRL. Particularly diehard fans might be miffed at how far The Phantom Pain has strayed from the formula established by Hideo Kojima’s first few Metal Gear Solid games, but in my eyes, just about every change is welcome. Older Metal Gear Solids had baffling controls, odd camera angles, and an incomprehensible story. Metal Gear Solid V has easy controls, a great camera, and… an incomprehensible story.

>The Phantom Pain's story is, like other Metal Gear Solid games, complex — and frustrating in that complexity. It can be clumsy, silly and puerile, but we're still hooked. There are dozens of audio tape conversations we've listened to to flesh out the backstory, with dozens more still to soak in. Without a doubt, this game has series creator Hideo Kojima's touch throughout, a fact we're reminded of the dozens of times the game says The Phantom Pain was directed and produced by Kojima.

>We left our session wanting more time with Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. From the amazing attention-grabbing opening sequence to the classic stealth gameplay and lively open-world, there is certainly a lot to be excited about from this latest (editor: and last Kojima) entry. There is no doubt that it is going to be loved by both veterans and newcomers to the Metal Gear franchise.

>I will say that Kojima has crafted an incredibly memorable game, and when all is said and done, possibly his best. Jeremy and I will have plenty more to say about The Phantom Pain in the next week or so; but in lieu of a final score, I'll just say that, yes, it's definitely worth playing. Regardless of how you end up feeling about The Phantom Pain, there's truly no game like it.

>What do I think, at this stage, as vaguely lunatic fan? It's incredible. For me MGS5 is the densest, most considered, open-world stealth game ever, with a sense of physical space to rival Red Dead Redemption, but precise, deep controls that only the greatest Japanese action games seem to understand. It doesn't really feel like any MGS game before it, but is the culmination of everything the series has been building toward. The MGS series has always been defined by its contradictions: its double and triple agents, its characters of multiple aliases and grey area morality. If Metal Gear Solid is an anti-war series that makes war feels heroic, MGS5 is its purest expression yet. At the same time, though, it’s the least 'Metal Gear' Metal Gear game ever, liberated from its traditional, relatively-linear structure and yawing cut-scenes. That's my non-review review and, until I receive and finish the game, this confounding duality is as fitting a conclusion as the brilliant, challenging and idiosyncratic MGS5 deserves.

**Destructoid** - Chris Carter - [9 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-final-fantasy-xv-399859.phtml) (PS4)

>As I'm typing this up now, I'm seeing a future where people buy Final Fantasy XV due to some of the more positive assessments (like this one), and walk away disappointed. Because if you loathe JRPGs, XV is not going to make you a believer. In a way it's silly that Square spent 10 years making this, and it feels like a really shiny version of something it would have actually made 10 years ago. While a complete overhaul of the genre would certainly suit someone's needs, XV suits mine just fine.

**GamesRadar+** - David Roberts - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-xv-review/) (PS4)

>Even when it stumbles, Final Fantasy 15's ambitious open-world, fast-paced combat, and the humanity of its four leads make it a fascinating adventure to behold.

--------------

**GearNuke** - Khurram Imtiaz - [9 / 10](http://gearnuke.com/final-fantasy-xv-review/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV is a breath of fresh air for the series which was starting to lose its significance after the release of Final Fantasy XIII. It is one of the best open world game on the current generation consoles and a return to the form for the franchise.

--------------

**IGN** - Vince Ingenito - [8.2 / 10](http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/28/final-fantasy-xv-review) (PS4)

>When I’m riding chocobos across the beach at dusk with my three friends and hunting iconic Final Fantasy monsters in a huge, picturesque open world, Final Fantasy XV feels like nearly everything I could want from a modern Final Fantasy. But when it funnels me into linear scenarios and drab, constricted spaces that plunge the simplistic combat into chaos, my blood boils a bit. There is so much good here, so much heart - especially in the relationships between Noctis and his sworn brothers. It just comes with some changes and compromises that were, at times, difficult for this long-time Final Fantasy fan to come to grips with.

--------------

**TheSixthAxis** - Dominic Leighton - [8 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/12/06/final-fantasy-xv-review/)

>Final Fantasy XV is a unique offering, both for the franchise and RPGs in general. Placing the onus on the relationships of your party, rather than the narrative, has meant that this is a game that strikes not just an emotional chord, but a personal one. While Final Fantasy stalwarts will likely balk at the action-heavy combat, the spirit of the franchise remains, and is better served here than it has been in many years.

>Final Fantasy XV wasn’t a bad game, but after all that hype, and being a first time player, I was disappointed with what was offered. There’s many features about the game that I can praise like the combat and dialogue, but there’s those negatives that makes it a disappointing first experience. I feel this is going to be a game with very mixed opinions, and I’m sure there’s many playing it early who think it’s a great game, but for me personally, this was a good yet disappointing game.

**USgamer** - Kat Bailey - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/final-fantasy-xv-playstation-4-review-end-of-the-road) (PS4)

>I was really skeptical that Final Fantasy XV could ever be successful; but despite some real flaws, it ultimately won me over. I warmed to the characters over the course of many camping trips, found more than I was expecting in the open world, and even enjoyed the bombastic setpieces. I have no doubt that it will be harshly criticized in some circles, but it also has some real merit. Stick with it even if you find yourself rolling your eyes at the opening hours: You may be surprised by how much you end up enjoying yourself.

--------------

**Xbox Achievements** - Dom Peppiatt - [90%](http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/final-fantasy-xv/review/) (PS4, XB1)

>As an RPG, Final Fantasy XV has everything you’d expect: a compelling, emotional story; a tapestry of complimentary mechanics; a significant lifespan; a cast of relatable and well-written characters and a world that’s dense enough to be a character in and of itself. As a Final Fantasy game, it lives up to all the tropes, despite the variations it’s taken from the more ‘classic’ games. Final Fantasy XV is a title that's aimed super high, and although maybe it hasn’t quite hit the targets it set for itself, it certainly doesn’t disappoint, and is a strong enough RPG experience to stand aside The Witcher as one of the best open-world role-playing games of this generation.

**Kotaku** - Jason Schreier - [Unscored](http://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xv-the-kotaku-review-1789400066) (PS4)

>It’s got everything I want from a Final Fantasy game. I know that it’ll be yet another snapshot in a life filled with Final Fantasy. Another grand adventure, another gang of worthy heroes; another tale of crystals and magic and betrayal and love, all beautiful melodies and lush scenery and the finely honed complexity of carefully choreographed combat. Onward to secrets beyond the horizon, and don’t forget the Phoenix Down. If that’s not Final Fantasy, I don’t know what is.

>Final Fantasy XV is about adventure and excitement. There are oddities, and it's not the FF you're used to, but it's a good time with some good boys, and has an unexpected emotional resonance to it. Sometimes it seems like it shouldn't work, but it does.

--------------

**Daily Dot** - Miguel Concepcion - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/final-fantasy-xv-15-review/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV overcomes its narrative lows with gameplay highs that consume the player's time with engrossing optional quests and frenetic battles. As a whole, it does not represent the best in the series, but it delivers just enough to deserve a place in the mainline series, which is an achievement for a game that originated as a Final Fantasy XIII spin-off.

--------------

**Twinfinite** - [4.5 / 5](http://twinfinite.net/2016/11/final-fantasy-xv-review/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV was quite different from everything I had ever expected an entry to be, but it turned out to be exactly what I had been looking for.

**Time** - Matt Peckham - [4.5 / 5](http://time.com/4580955/final-fantasy-xv-review/) (PS4)

>Something wonderful and improbable must have happened towards the end of the topsy-turvy decade it’s taken Square Enix to finally produce a Final Fantasy worth crowing about. Thank director Hajime Tabata for somehow righting the ship. How he did so could presumably fill a book. How many games get 10 years to simmer? Change captains mid-journey? Have lord knows how many investment dollars (to say nothing of franchise esteem) on the line? And how often does vaporware materialize, after years of elliptical studio messaging, this lively and focused and fully realized?

>All these provisos and caveats mean that Final Fantasy XV is one game where the score is almost completely irrelevant. But that hints at the game’s greatest failing: that it is not going to surprise either its fans or its critics. If this seems like your type of thing then you’re almost certainly going to enjoy it. But if you usually turn your nose up at Japanese role-players then this is not the game to convince you otherwise. Because despite its achievements, and genuine attempts to move the genre forward, this does not feel like the last word in Final Fantasy.

I’m going to continue through the world of Lucis and give you all a full review as soon as I’ve experienced everything Final Fantasy XV has to offer. So far though I have to say that this is one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I’ve had in this decade, though I must admit a little bias because I love the Final Fantasy series.

**We Got This Covered** - Jowi Meli - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/final-fantasy-xv-review/)

>Final Fantasy XV might continue the series’ divisive streak thanks to a number of drastic changes to the tried-and-true formula, but I personally welcomed all of these with open arms. A beautiful world, exciting real time combat and a fascinating blend of open world and linear gameplay add up to a can’t-miss experience for JRPG fans. Though the remains of a long and troubled development cycle are evident in some of its rougher patches, this new entry in the legendary RPG series comes out on top for never losing sight of its theme — a road trip that both the game’s characters and the players who go along with them won’t soon forget.

**Easy Allies** - Ben Moore - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0gvZhVhDX4) | [*Written Review*](http://easyallies.com/#!/review/final-fantasy-xv) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV has been a long time coming. Some have waited ever since they got their first glimpse of Noctis in 2006. Others wanted redemption after the divisive Final Fantasy XIII. The burden of expectation weighs heavy and in that sense Final Fantasy XV is not a cure-all that will please everyone. At the same time, the game feels like a leap in the right direction. At its end, we aren’t thinking about story inconsistencies or derivative side quests. We’ve found ourselves attached to a group of four friends and we’re thankful for the adventure.

**Paste Magazine** - Eric Van Allen - [8.5 / 10](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/11/the-messy-but-earnest-final-fantasy-xv-doesnt-play.html) (PS4)

>There is no doubt Final Fantasy XV will be divisive, but in not playing it safe, the game earns a bit of my heart back with each errant monster hunt or one-off gameplay section. It’s messy, but earnestly so, like that high-school mirror selfie. Recalling all the good and bad, the moments that make you cringe and a warmth that makes you smile, you know not everything was perfect. You can only say you’re glad you chose to make the journey.

--------------

**Stevivor** - Matt Gosper - [8.5 / 10](http://stevivor.com/2016/11/review-final-fantasy-xv/) (PS4)

>While I may not think of this personally as a true Final Fantasy title, that doesn’t make it any less of a good game. Despite all my above quibbles, I still haven’t been able to put the controller down for any longer than it takes to visit the bathroom or refuel my needy human body. It’s understandable why this was set as a side title to the franchise initially, given how much it plays with the formula, but fresh input is what is needed to keep this franchise alive. Final Fantasy XV welcomes new players with open arms, and challenges long-time fans to try something new. It’s worth your time, and worth the wait.

--------------

**Cheat Code Central** - Becky Cunningham - [4 / 5](http://cheatcc.com/ps4/rev/finalfantasyxvreview.html) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV is imperfect, but the high points of this journey outweigh the messy bits. I recommend you learn to go with the flow, spend some time with your bros, and really get lost in the game. Don't try too hard to be a completionist, but don't forsake the open-world adventures and cling too much to the main storyline. It's in the balance between the two that this tale is at its absolute best.

--------------

**AngryCentaurGaming** - Jeremy Penter - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdL72v_ERiA) (PS4, XB1) 

>If you're a fan of Final Fantasy, this is a 'Buy'. Listen, if you're not a fan of Final Fantasy, some stuff here may actually get you interested. I enjoy the combat system and of course these worlds are never really that connected, so you can always jump in without feeling too lost. But, if you are a fan, it's an instant buy. It offers an enjoyable trip through a new land, a unique twist on combat and some of the best locations in an RPG in a long damn time. Now it's not a classic and not up to the fine form some of the prior games have shown, but it's a solid contender and offers enough enjoyable playtime that as long as you know what you're getting into, whether you're an old fan or a new fan, you will probably walk away satisfied. Speaking of walking away, there's probably a good chance you'll walk away wondering just how much you would have enjoyed this though, had some of those technical issues not been there.

**PlayStation LifeStyle** - Keri Honea - [8.5 / 10](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2016/12/01/final-fantasy-xv-review-east-meets-west-ps4/#/slide/1) (PS4)

>Square Enix has taken quite a few risks with Final Fantasy XV to make it different from past installments or even JRPGs overall. Despite some graphical issues, they have pulled off an amazing experience, and it’s one that veterans and newcomers alike can immensely enjoy. This road trip has been well worth the wait.

--------------

**Hardcore Gamer** - Adam Beck - [3.5 / 5](http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/12/01/review-final-fantasy-xv/237763/) (PS4)

>After ten long years of development, Final Fantasy XV ends up being more style than substance. It’s apparent that a lot of content wasn’t able to make the final cut as there are characters who are killed off or removed from the plot off-screen with little to no explanation, despite their important appearance and stature. The story is also poorly paced, with the core open world being utilized within the first eight chapters and the remaining seven ending up as a linear slog. It’s apparent that the story isn’t going to win any awards, but the final four chapters wind up ruining what would’ve been a decent adventure thanks to the poor plot devices. With that said, the gameplay helps make up for some of these wrongdoings. Easily the best part of Final Fantasy XV is the world Square Enix has created, as while the populated side quests lack inspiration, it ends up being an absolutely beautiful and vast playground to explore. The charming character chemistry among the four protagonists is also properly developed and the fluid combat mechanics aid the overall enjoyment. There are moments of brilliance spread across the campaign, but with it comes a frustratingly disheartening story.

--------------

**TrustedReviews** - Stuart Andrews - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.trustedreviews.com/final-fantasy-15-review) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy 15 is the best single-player Final Fantasy in a decade. The new combat system is more action-oriented, but still surprisingly tactical, while the new focus on open-world exploration brings the game and its world to life. Crammed with character, choice and interest, it’s an RPG where the good times keep on rolling down the road.

--------------

**Digitally Downloaded** - Matt Sainsbury - [5 / 5 stars](http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2016/12/review-final-fantasy-xv-sony.html) (PS4)

>This game alone catapults Square Enix's most important franchise right back into the circle of most elite properties in gaming, proves that AAA games can be intelligent and meaningful, and deserves every plaudit and accolade out there.

--------------

**Parallax Live** - Parallax Live - [85%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on8U8rRSStg) (PS4)

>Nevertheless, we're happy to recommend this to newbies or veterans of the series alike. If you're looking for a meaty game that can keep you satisfied until Christmas, Final Fantasy XV ticks almost every box.

--------------

**Game Revolution** - Jonathan Leack - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/final-fantasy-xv) (PS4, XB1)

>What Final Fantasy XV succeeds at more than anything is providing an unpredictable and memorable adventure. Captivating story and characters were sacrificed along the way, but more than anything this game needed to prove that Final Fantasy can still execute greatness while taking risks. Its combat system and world design carry most of the weight, supported by attractive secondary activities and a great progression system. The result is something that doesn't necessarily feel like any Final Fantasy before it, although its high production values certainly make it deserving of the name.

--------------

**Attack of the Fanboy** - Dean James - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xv-review/) (XB1)

>Final Fantasy XV had quite a lot to live up to after so many years, and while it may have taken a decade to get here, the journey was worth the wait with this phenomenal entry in the series.

--------------

**Impulsegamer** - Andrew Bistak - [4.5 / 5](http://www.impulsegamer.com/final-fantasy-xv-review-final-fantasy-15/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV is a fantastic new direction for the series that positively creates an interactive and detailed world for players to explore with a fun bromance in the background. As highlighted by the developers, it’s both a game for fans and first-timers and although the traditional mechanics have been tweaked, especially when it comes to combat, it still feels like a Final Fantasy game but more importantly a Final Fantasy game for next-gen consoles.

--------------

**COGconnected** - Michael Chow - [90 / 100](http://cogconnected.com/review/final-fantasy-xv-review/) (PS4)

>Some great character depth as well as an overhaul to both the Final Fantasy formula and battle system makes Final Fantasy XV a delight for existing fans and new players.

--------------

**Worth Playing** - Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus - [8 / 10](http://worthplaying.com/article/2016/12/5/reviews/101551/) (PS4)

>It's difficult to judge Final Fantasy XV. It bears all the scars of troubled development, and it has a list of nagging issues a mile long, but it's more than the sum of its parts. It's fun to play and has plenty of charming and likeable moments that balance out the frustrating time-wasting elements and weak plot. FF15 is a solid entry into the franchise and is as accessible to newcomers as it is to longtime fans. It might have some rough patches, but FF15 shows that it cares about the most important thing of all: fun.

--------------

**Ars Technica** - Simon Parkin - [Unscored](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/12/final-fantasy-15-review/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV takes the series in a new direction, but despite some memorable moments, it remains remains a confused, uneven package.

--------------

**GameZone** - Tom Caswell - [Unscored](http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-xv-is-a-tale-of-two-games-k30j) (XB1)

>A totally competent entry in the franchise that fans and newcomers will enjoy, even if that means they won't necessarily be floored by it.

--------------

**GBAtemp** - Tom Bond - [6.5 / 10](http://gbatemp.net/review/final-fantasy-xv.544/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV is an ok game for the most part. My biggest complaints are with the lackluster story, the lack of that “Final Fantasy” feel thanks to the modernized world, and the occasional technical issues. Is it truly a Final Fantasy game for fans and first timers? I don’t think so. All the changes they made to the standard Final Fantasy formula don’t necessarily sit well with previous games. Would I still recommend FFXV? If you’re a true JRPG fan looking for a change, absolutely.

--------------

**Game Rant** - Denny Connolly - [4.5 / 5](https://gamerant.com/final-fantasy-15-review/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy 15 attempts to deliver an action-oriented RPG road trip that can please both old school fans and draw in fresh blood. The bro-themed road trip pulls it off.

--------------

**DualShockers** - Giuseppe Nelva - [9 / 10](http://www.dualshockers.com/2016/12/06/final-fantasy-xv-review-ps4-xbox-one/) (PS4)

>It’s also a monument to the determination and dedication of a team that quite obviously poured an inordinate amount of love and passion into creating a fantastic world that is worth exploring and living, and a lovely quartet of boys that are exceptional in their normality and humanity.

I couldn’t ask for better virtual friends than Ignis, Gladio and Prompto. I laughed with them, cried with them, and I really love them.

--------------

**PlayStation Universe** - Neil Bolt - [8.5 / 10](http://www.psu.com/review/31735/final-fantasy-15-review) (PS4)

>A strong-willed effort to update the series, Final Fantasy XV rises above its myriad flaws to deliver an odd, beautiful adventure that harnesses the power of friendship to maximum effect. A pleasing return to form for a much beloved series.

--------------

**GameSpew** - Richard Seagrave - [8 / 10](http://www.gamespew.com/2016/12/final-fantasy-xv-review/) (PS4)

>When it’s at its best, generally during the latter third of the game, the results are often phenomenal. At its worst, you’ll wonder how it can pass as a Final Fantasy game. On the whole though, the good far outweighs the bad, making Final Fantasy XV a flawed but essential title for fans of the long-running series.

--------------

**Reno Gazette-Journal** - Jason Hidalgo - [4.25 / 5](http://www.rgj.com/story/life/2016/12/06/final-fantasy-15-xv-review-technobubble/95018754/) (XB1)

>Final Fantasy XV represents a coming of age, not just for its protagonist but a series that was met with a polarized response from Final Fantasy XIII. It shows some courageous risk-taking that breathes new life into the series’ aging formula while also encouraging the kind of exploration that was lacking in FF13. Admittedly, the modern settings and new magic system dilute some of the fantasy elements the series is known for, and the hybrid turn-based and real-time combat system can feel like a compromise to fans of the two differing styles. At the same time, this is a worthy addition to the Final Fantasy franchise that looks to the future while also honoring its past.

--------------

**TheSixthAxis** - Dominic Leighton - [8 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/12/06/final-fantasy-xv-review/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV is a unique offering, both for the franchise and RPGs in general. Placing the onus on the relationships of your party, rather than the narrative, has meant that this is a game that strikes not just an emotional chord, but a personal one. While Final Fantasy stalwarts will likely balk at the action-heavy combat, the spirit of the franchise remains, and is better served here than it has been in many years.

--------------

**RPG Fan** - Nicholas Ransbottom - [88%](http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2016/5645.html) (PS4)

>With a fresh combat system and a lovable cast, Final Fantasy XV excels at its goal of being a title for both fans and newcomers alike.

--------------

**EGM** - Mollie L. Patterson - [7.5 / 10](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/final-fantasy-xv-review/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV is nowhere close to the game that we should have received after 10 years of waiting—but it also isn’t anywhere close to the trainwreck that it easily could have been. While the storytelling is a mess and the game feels incomplete far too often, there’s enough to love here—from combat, to exploration, to the four Japanese pretty boys that make up your main party—to make FFXV a road trip worth going on.

--------------

**GamesBeat** - Mike Minotti - [90 /100](http://venturebeat.com/2016/11/28/final-fantasy-xv-review/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV has its problems, but it’s filled with enough special moments that you can forgive the issues. The combat is fluid, thoughtful, and cinematic while the open world gives you a ton to do.

--------------

**Rocket Chainsaw** - Adam Ghiggino - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.rocketchainsaw.com.au/ps4/final-fantasy-xv-review-finally-here-1124/) (PS4)

>Let’s get the obvious question out of the way – was Final Fantasy XV worth the wait? Honestly, from the jumbled storyline it seems the project has to have been changed, re-jigged, and re-thought so many times that I doubt whether the final product resembles the original concept fans were waiting for all this time. What the game is ultimately, is Square-Enix’s response to more modern open-world RPG’s and bringing Final Fantasy up to speed to play in that space. And despite poor storytelling and a dodgy linear back half,  the majority of the game delivers on a satisfying open-world experience, with tons to do, deep combat and some fantastical visuals. Luckily, you’ll spend far more time in the open-world than you will in the main quest (I spent 40 hours in-game, probably 25 of which were in side content), and it’s easy to recommend for that aspect alone. Final Fantasy XV feels like a true progression for the series, and I can only hope XVI isn’t another 10 years away.

--------------

**Do You Even Game Bro?** - Kieran Stockton - [7.9 / 10](http://www.doyouevengamebro.net/ffxv-review/) (PS4)

>Lacklustre side missions and difficulty balance issues can't fully tarnish this beautiful adventure in a grand setting. Final Fantasy XV is a game that fought hard to exist, and does the series proud

--------------

**Pause Resume** - Casey Wilkerson - [3 / 5](http://www.pauseresume.com/final-fantasy-xv-review/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy 15 is a wonderful title, and a hell of a lot of fun to have played. It’s easily one of the best JRPG’s I’ve ever seen, and I wanted so badly to give it a four out of five, but when I realized that I finished reading an entire novel waiting to get from place to place in the Regalia, I knew I couldn’t. It’s a fine game, and it deserves a chance, but I hope everyone has a bit more patience than I do.

--------------

**SA Gamer** - Garth Holden - [9.5 / 10](http://sagamer.co.za/playstation/review-final-fantasy-xv-ps4) (PS4)

>This might be the darkest game in the series, but it is also, I feel, the best one so far. This is Final Fantasy, right down to the heart of it: four warriors of light looking for a crystal.

--------------

**Next-Gen Gaming Blog** - Adam Neaves - [10 / 10](http://nextgengamingblog.com/blog/final-fantasy-xv-review/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV is not only my favourite game of 2016, it is up there as one of my favourite games of all time. I could of easily used another 2 or 3 thousand words to describe this game, but if you are reading this, get out and buy this game now! With 100 hours easy of gameplay packed in, including hundreds of sidequests, fishing, chocobo racing and more, Final Fantasy XV will keep you very busy this Christmas period. Square Enix put at the start of the game, Final Fantasy XV is a Final Fantasy for newcomers and veterans of the series, and they are right. Perfection is hard to get, but this comes as near as you're ever going to get.

--------------

**Gamerheadquarters** - Jason Stettner - [8.2 / 10](http://articles.gamerheadquarters.com/review521finalfantasyxv.html) (XB1)

>Final Fantasy XV is an intriguing tale that follows the adventures of these close friends in an incredible world. The music is absolutely fantastic as well providing extra life to the story. I did find some aspects of the story to be a bit off, this being mainly in the tone considering the gravity of what was happening in the world. While smooth I also found the combat to be repetitive after awhile and the game could have used some better checkpoints. It was annoying to restart a dungeon at times and instead of battling through it again, I'd resort to just running by everything. That aside, the story was at its best during smaller interactions and the more intimate scenes with the group were great.

--------------

**Gadgets 360** - Rishi Alwani - [8 / 10](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/final-fantasy-xv-review-1630801) (PS4)

>Is Final Fantasy XV everything it ought to be? For fans, yes. Without question, this is the Final Fantasy game you’ve been waiting for. That's actually surprising given how tumultuous its decade-long development as been. For first-timers, it depends how tolerant you are of narrative failings. Look past that, and you’re treated to fantastic moment to moment gameplay, and an intricate set of systems that will have you coming back for more.

--------------

**Niche Gamer** - Michael Jordan - [7 / 10](http://nichegamer.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xv-review/) (PS4)

>Everything outside the story missions is a lot of fun, but the story missions themselves are a massive disappointment. It almost seems like there were two games being developed at the same time.

>The first is an amazingly interesting world-exploration game filled with great characters, interesting concepts, with the potential to expand; or a nonsensical, linear story game that feels it does not need to explain major portions of itself and leaves the player asking themselves “Why?” constantly. The world exploration, side quests, hunts, and clever travel banter is worth the purchase but the main story is not.

--------------

**Pure Playstation** - Kyle Durant - [6.5 / 10](http://pureplaystation.com/review-final-fantasy-xv-ps4/2016/12/) (PS4)

>The story and writing really let Final Fantasy XV down. Even the least favorite entries of the series have a coherent narrative albeit some unlikable ones. Characters are either here for no reason or haven't been developed in any way and certain actions/lack of knowledge between our main heroes really deprive this experience. I'm just glad the gameplay, combat, and interesting open world to explore redeemed Final Fantasy XV from obscurity. I take no pleasure in feeling this way about the highly anticipated title and I literally fell into a small depression after I beat the story. There are good ideas to like here but none of it comes together better than a high school literature project. If gameplay and exploration isn't enough to sate you (ala No Man's Sky) then this title may well be one to avoid.

**Goomba Stomp** - Mike Worby - [8.8 / 10](http://www.goombastomp.com/features/15-days-of-final-fantasy/final-fantasy-xv-satisfying-schizophrenic-ride/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV somehow transcends its many flaws in order to become a classic in its own right. Though any reviewer worth their salt would be hesitant to rate it too highly, due to its many faults, by any stretch of the gaming medium, Final Fantasy XV has clear and obvious merit, and, as such, cannot be dismissed or derided completely, even with its problems.

--------------

**ZTGD** - Jae Lee - [8 / 10](http://www.ztgd.com/final-fantasy-xv/review/) (PS4)

>With such a lengthy and troubled development cycle, it was really anyone’s guess how FFXV would turn out in the end. Even though I’m relatively pleased with the outcome as the four friends carry the moment to moment gameplay with grace, the disjointed and lackluster storyline leaves an indelible mark on what is otherwise an incredibly well crafted RPG well worth experiencing.

--------------

**PCMag** - Gabriel Zamora - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.pcmag.com/review/350114/final-fantasy-xv-for-playstation-4) (PS4)

>Final fantasy XV has solid open-world exploration, enjoyable action, and plenty of content, but it's packaged together with awkward gameplay decisions and a mess of a story.

--------------

**Arcade Sushi** - Jason Fanelli - [8.5 / 10](http://arcadesushi.com/final-fantasy-xv-review-playstation-4/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV is an ideal experience for a new age of the franchise, and I’m looking forward to diving back in to see what I missed the first time.

--------------

**MMORPG.com** - Robert Lashley - [9 / 10](http://www.mmorpg.com/final-fantasy-xv/reviews/into-the-light-1000000463)

>Final Fantasy XV is by no means a perfect game. There is a lot of potential and some of it does feel squandered but even with it’s shortcomings I truly enjoyed the adventure. The developers took risks and some of them paid off while others feel a little flat. I look forward to all of the upcoming free updates as well as the DLC and experiencing how the world evolves. The magic of the franchise is still there and I emotionally connected with this game the same now as I did with some of the other great entries at different points through my life. I may have ended up skipping a few along the way but XV definitely brought the allure and luster back. This really is a Final Fantasy for both new and old hats to the franchise alike.

**Wccftech** - Chris Wray - [8.5 / 10](http://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xv-review-the-long-road/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV is a true return to form for the series. The main story of the game is passable, but surpassed by the fantastic tale of Noctis and his three friends, Gladiolus, Prompto and Ignis. The world they live in, the interconnectivity and just how alive it feels makes for a great game, warts and all.

--------------

**TrueAchievements** - Kevin Tavore - [3.5 / 5 stars](https://www.trueachievements.com/n25960/final-fantasy-xv-review) (XB1)

>Final Fantasy XV is a game about a journey between friends and for a journey, it's a fine one. The game has got issues ranging from poor character development to dull combat and generic side quests, but it's also something special thanks to memorable friends and amazing music. The developer wanted to make a game for fans and newcomers alike and they made many changes to the typical Final Fantasy formula. The result is a game that is not like what you would expect, but for those who want to find something to love here, there's something to find.

--------------

**High-Def Digest** - Sophia Edwards - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://games.highdefdigest.com/24457/final_fantasy_xv_ps4.html) (PS4)

>While it occasionally buckles under its own ambition and the game falters somewhat as the plot ramps up, overall 'Final Fantasy XV' is a beautiful, exciting game that I dearly loved. It may not be the best game I've played this year, but it is almost certainly my favorite, and Square Enix has built an incredible, extremely unique open-world. While I'm not sure I want 'FFXVI' to follow suit and be an open-world like this one, I'd absolutely love to see them expand upon some of the ideas presented here in future. A remarkable return to form for a franchise that many felt had lost its way.

--------------

**The Jimquisition** - Jim Sterling - [8 / 10](http://www.thejimquisition.com/final-fantasy-xv-review/) (PS4)

>Final Fantasy XV, despite significant and glaring problems, is still a lovely time that managed to make me like Final Fantasy again. It’s a character piece, and the characters we spend our time with are fully realized and play off each other so well. It’s a lighter journey that nonetheless knows when to get serious, spurred by a charismatic nemesis and a quartet of lovable, beautiful boys.

I'm using the PC credits, which are slightly different than the Xbox credits. I'll be breaking this up into people who still work at Bioware and people who are elsewhere. At the bottom I’ll leave a few things I found interesting while doing this research. Again, this is not everyone who worked on the game. I left out some of the more administrative roles at Bioware and didn’t look at the the other companies or the voice actors who worked on the game. 

With that said, let’s jump in.


## At Bioware

Dean Andersen worked as a 3D artist for the game. Andersen did additional art for Jade Empire before becoming art director for Dragon Age. He next worked as assistant director of art and animation for Dragon Age Awakening, Dragon Age 2 and Mass Effect 2. In 2010 Andersen became director of creative development at Bioware and worked on Mass Effect 3 and Inquisition. Andersen is currently creative manager of Bioware’s Montreal studio.

Alain Baxter worked in quality assurance for the game. Baxter became the QA lead for Jade Empire and did additional production for Mass Effect. Baxter was part of the core design team for Dragon Age and was one of the project managers. Baxter was project development director of Dragon Age 2, a project manager for Mass Effect 3: Citadel and most most recently was a development director for Inquisition. 

Owen Borstad worked as a tools programmer for the game. Borstad worked as the programming lead for the PC version of Mass Effect and was the lead programmer for some of the DLC for Dragon Age. Borstad last worked as a multiplayer and online programmer for Inquisition. He seems to still be at Bioware.

Patrick Chan worked as a graphics programmer for the game. Chan was the lead graphics programmer for Jade Empire and worked as a programmer for Dragon Age (Graphics), The Old Republic (Gameplay) and Inquisition (Platform). 

David Falkner worked as one of the lead programmers and was part of the core design team. Falkner was last lead programmer on Mass Effect 3 and did additional programming for Inquisition. He seems to be working on the new Bioware IP.

Dan Fessenden worked as a programmer for the game. Fessenden last worked as a technical designer for Andromeda.

Aaryn Flynn worked as a programmer for the game. Flynn became director of programming at Bioware before becoming general manager of Bioware Edmonton in 2009. In 2015 Flynn became general manger for all of Bioware.

Nathan Frederick worked in quality assurance. Frederick is currently QA lead at Bioware, and has worked on Jade Empire, Mass Effect 1 + 2 and the Dragon Age series.

Derek French worked as live team producer. French has worked as a producer and in studio operations. Most recently French worked in developer-publishing support for Andromeda.

Steven Gilmour worked as the lead animator and was part of the core design team. Gilmour has continued to work as the lead animator for Bioware games and is currently working on the new Bioware IP.

Matthew Goldman worked making additional art for the game. Goldman worked as art director before leaving at the end of 2005 to work at Ensemble Games on Halo Wars. Goldman returned to Bioware in 2009 and worked as a senior artist on Dragon Age and art director on 2 and Inquisition. 

Keith Hayward worked in quality assurance. Hayward also worked in QA for Jade Empire, and was a technical or level designer for Mass Effect series and Inquisition.

Now, for a few interesting things I found doing this

* There were 7 members of the core design team. 6 are still at Bioware.

* I looked at 117 people for this thread. 38 are still at Bioware and 79 are elsewhere. That's 32% of the staff still at Bioware (which is the same percent that I found for Halo 2) after 14 years.

* There were at least two unannounced games at Bioware that were canceled. One was a second DS game following Sonic Chronicles with multiplayer elements. The other was a game that seemed to focus on fluid movement that was in development in 2008.

* Two different people left Bioware to work on Halo Wars and returned to Bioware after the game was finished.

* Multiple people on the team have been/are part of a musical group.

* A fair amount of people joined Capcom Vancouver

* All three Witcher games have KOTOR connections. 1 and 2 in PR and marketing, and 3 in community manager.",1493561482.0

***AngryCentaurGaming*** - [Jeremy Penter](http://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter)|Wait for Sale ~ [Wait For Sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhyvG2bluik)|*This is a 'Wait For Sale'. For Far Cry games, it's always two steps forward one step back and the improvements here are keen, but what my gameplay always came down to was the fact that the spawning system was just so out of control and everything felt so messy over time. Any engagement I wanted to have would always be infected by some type of badger or creature leaping in and attacking everybody, and at first that was fine, but when it stopped characters from being able to talk to me because they get halfway through their sentence and then some animal would attack and it reset everybody, that just started to get a little bit bothersome.*|PS4
**Leadergamer** - [Emrah Subaşı](http://opencritic.com/critic/5024/emrah-suba-) - *Turkish*|Essential ~ [Essential](https://leadergamer.com.tr/far-cry-5-inceleme/)|*Far Cry 5 learned its lessons from Ubisoft's mistakes and the game's series. Missions don't repeat themselves and offers fun and long gameplay. Despite minor mistakes, Far Cry 5 deserves to be liked.*|
***Eurogamer*** - [Edwin Evans-Thirlwell](http://opencritic.com/critic/132/edwin-evans-thirlwell)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-03-25-far-cry-5-review)|*Make Montana emergent again.*|PS4
**Pardis Game** - [Alireza Razmjoei](http://opencritic.com/critic/3953/alireza-razmjoei) - *Persian*|Unscored ~ [Unscored](http://pardisgame.net/story-24316-نقد-و-بررسی-اولیه-Far-Cry-5.html)|*Without a doubt, Far Cry 5 is the most varied game in the series. Thanks to smart changes to the exploring formula and of course amazing world of Hope County, we can finally say that Far Cry series has evolved.*|PS4
**The A.V. Club** - [William Hughes](http://opencritic.com/critic/1176/william-hughes)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://games.avclub.com/far-cry-5-cares-less-about-politics-than-being-the-rein-1824053627)|*Montana features some of the most beautiful country in all of America, and Ubisoft has done an amazing job of capturing its rural glory. And the freedom to get credit for just f***** around in this gorgeous world, doing whatever feels most fun, is legitimately intoxicating.*|PS4
**Player2.net.au** - [Matt Hewson](http://opencritic.com/critic/3904/matt-hewson)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://player2.net.au/2018/03/far-cry-5-single-player-review/)|*Is Far Cry 5 just another Far Cry game? Well, yes it is, but at the same time, it is more than that. This is a game that has taken what came before it and improved upon it in every single way. The story is brutal, engaging and utterly enthralling, the main characters are memorable and the gameplay is refined and presented in a clever and natural way. So yes this is just another Far Cry game, it is Far Cry at its peak, the best that Far Cry can be and that is truly something worth playing.*|
**Waypoint** - [Austin Walker](https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/contributor/austin-walker)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/qvxbeb/far-cry-5-review)|*Despite a strong premise and updates to the series formula, FC5 fails to find a compelling identity.*|
**CNET** - [Jeff Bakalar](https://www.cnet.com/profiles/jbakalar/)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/products/far-cry-5-sony-playstation-4/review/)|*Far Cry 5 is an awesome open-world action game, delivering the most fully realized, player-driven entry in the series to date.*|PS4
***Kotaku*** - [Ethan Gach](http://opencritic.com/critic/1454/ethan-gach)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://kotaku.com/far-cry-5-the-kotaku-review-1824076892)|*Far Cry games are laboratories for experimenting, giving you the freedom to do stuff ordinary games won’t, like throw a molotov cocktail at just about anything and watch it burn to the ground. They usually have better shooting than most open world games, and better open worlds than most shooters. Far Cry 5 nails that part of the series’ legacy. The game’s missions flow together organically and let you shift from capturing a cult outpost using an array of explosives and guns to scaling cliffs in search of hidden caches of equipment and lore-filled collectibles. It fails, however, to meaningfully move beyond the rest of the series in merging the violence and chaos these experiments produce with the community of people scattered throughout its world.*|
**Saving Content** - [Scott Ellison II](http://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.savingcontent.com/2018/03/26/far-cry-5-review/)|*Hope County, Montana is the American Dream turned Nightmare. Far Cry 5 is dense with activities, people, places, and events that are never overwhelming, but wrack you with indecision as to what to do next. While Far Cry as a series still struggles with the juxtaposition of its humor and seriousness, it manages to do this well enough to not let them get in the way of each other. Far Cry 5 is a shining example of how to revitalize the open world, as this is the best realized game in the series to date, with a convincing villain and a tale to match its tone. Far Cry 5 will make you a believer.*|PC
**Windows Central** - [Jez Corden](http://opencritic.com/critic/4653/jez-corden)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](http://www.windowscentral.com/far-cry-5-review)|*Ultimately, Far Cry 5 is a relentlessly fun, aggressively varied open world shooter that will keep you hooked for dozens and dozens of hours. The game's world has never felt more alive, brimming with animal ecosystems, serene lakes, and verdant forests, with spectacular scenery just begging to be screenshotted.*|XB1
**Cheat Code Central** - [April Marie](http://opencritic.com/critic/1132/april-marie)|96 ~ [4.8 / 5](http://www.cheatcc.com/ps4/rev/farcry5review.html)|*It might seem like I have a lot of complaints for a game I'm touting as being really good, but the positives of Far Cry 5 outweigh the negative. You can play exactly how you want. You can stealthily take down an entire region, before moving to another. You can run and gun your way through all three simultaneously. The characters that you meet are varied and engaging. There are tons of things to do and see, and plenty of real and virtual people to experience them with. Most of all, Far Cry 5 tells a story that grabs you by the shirt collar and never lets go.*|PS4
**GameSpace** - [Damien Gula](http://opencritic.com/critic/4314/damien-gula)|95 ~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.gamespace.com/far-cry-5/review/)|*Far Cry 5 is an artistic lesson in juxtaposition. On one hand you have a group of devoted followers of a ""message of peace"" that live in violence. You have a calm and charismatic leader who insights calamity. There are communities united in anarchy. Far Cry 5 provokes its audience to think and wrestle with the uncomfortable answers to our own ""what-ifs"" about faith, family, and the power of community.*|PS4
**Hobby Consolas** - [Álvaro Alonso](http://opencritic.com/critic/3755/-lvaro-alonso) - *Spanish*|93 ~ [93 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-far-cry-5-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc-197122)|*Simply put, Far Cry 5 is the best Far Cry game to date. It has the best story, the best progression and introduces a lot of changes (for the good) while maintaining that explosive old formula that works so freaking well. God Bless Hope County.*|PS4
**Oyungezer Online** - [Utku Çakır](http://opencritic.com/critic/3618/utku-ak-r) - *Turkish*|92 ~ [9.2 / 10](http://oyungezer.com.tr/haber/52792-far-cry-5-inceleme)|*Your visit to Hope County will offer an unforgettable experience. I can wholeheartedly recommend Far Cry 5 to everyone.*|XB1
**VGN** - [Tommaso Stio](http://opencritic.com/critic/4176/tommaso-stio) - *Italian*|92 ~ [9.2 / 10](https://www.vgn.it/recensione/54324/far-cry-5-ps4/)|*Far Cry 5 is the result of a strong development made during the past few years by Ubisoft. It really is a mixture of all the strengths belonging to this saga until today. Although this new chapter detaches from a well agreed scheme, as it happened during the third episode with Vaas Montenegro, it is still capable to draw a good starting point for this series. And of course, this is the best Far Cry ever made.*|PS4
**Wccftech** - [Kai Powell](http://opencritic.com/critic/1914/kai-powell)|91 ~ [9.1 / 10](https://wccftech.com/review/far-cry-5-open-world-bliss/)|*If you're wondering whether bringing the madness to our doorstep, making the entire campaign co-op and including an impressive toolbox to create new levels and missions while still retaining that visceral gunplay the series is known for keeps Far Cry 5 fresh and worth playing on Day One, my answer is: yes, absolutely.*|PS4, PC
**IGN Spain** - [Juan García](http://opencritic.com/critic/3435/juan-garc-a) - *Spanish*|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://es.ign.com/far-cry-5-xbox-one/131144/review/far-cry-5-analisis-para-ps4-one-y-pc)|*Far Cry 5 is as good as we were wishing, offering a great campaign with lots of freedom and things to do, a satisfying narrative and surprising multiplayer options through Far Cry Arcade. A pretty complete pack.*|XB1
**COGconnected** - [Paul Sullivan](http://opencritic.com/critic/808/paul-sullivan)|90 ~ [90 / 100](http://cogconnected.com/review/far-cry-5-review/)|*The characters and story really make Far Cry 5 a brave product.*|PS4
**God is a Geek** - [Chris White](http://opencritic.com/critic/582/chris-white)|90 ~ [9 / 10.0](http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/far-cry-5-review/)|*The best Far Cry yet, with well written characters, lots of freedom to play how you want, and a lot of fun to be had on your own or with a friend.*|PS4
**Press Start** - [Toby Berger](http://opencritic.com/critic/1261/toby-berger)|90 ~ [9 / 10 stars](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2018/03/26/far-cry-5-review-bliss-filled-retreat/)|*Far Cry 5 is an absolute blast from beginning to end, chock full of things to do and involve yourself in. The narrative is interesting, and everything you do in Hope County feels meaningful in some way or another — making for an experience that feels as rewarding as it does enjoyable.*|PS4
**SA Gamer** - [Garth Holden](http://opencritic.com/critic/2217/garth-holden)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://sagamer.co.za/review-far-cry-5-ps4)|*Far Cry 5 is the height of the series and gives new legs to exploration in open world games while keeping the freeform tools to take down places as you see fit. Welcome to Hope County, you will be here a while.*|PS4
**USgamer** - [Mike Williams](http://opencritic.com/critic/299/mike-williams)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/far-cry-5-review)|*Far Cry 5 is a game that struggles in trying to serve two purposes. On one hand, there's a dark, horrific tale of a cult taking over a small town. On the other, it's a playground of destruction, letting players fly and drive around, blowing up things with a bear and a dog. Both sides are good, but they don't really meet in the middle. If you can survive the tonal whiplash, you'll find a great game here and Far Cry Arcade only makes it better.*|PS4
**TheSixthAxis** - [Gareth Chadwick](http://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/03/26/far-cry-5-review/)|*Far Cry 5 is another improvement to a series that hit its stride quite a long time ago. It gets a recommendation not because of any of its individual features, but because they all combine together into a game that becomes paradoxically funny and horrifying, occasionally at the same time. It depicts a part of America lovingly with its tongue very firmly glued to its cheek, but when I close my eyes, I still see Joseph Seed staring back at me.*|PS4
**We Got This Covered** - [David Morgan](http://opencritic.com/critic/4511/david-morgan)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5 stars](http://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/far-cry-5-review/)|*Ubisoft have cherry-picked everything that has made the Far Cry series successful, and distilled it into a single, laser-focused package.  Far Cry 5 probably isn't going to blow anyone's mind, but it provides a continuously fun experience that avoids the repetition and formulaic nature of past titles.*|PS4
**PlayStation Universe** - [Garri Bagdasarov](http://opencritic.com/critic/840/garri-bagdasarov)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/far-cry-5-review-ps4/)|*Far Cry 5 is the best Far Cry to date. The great additions and refinements made to the franchise are fantastic. Along with the inclusion of Far Cry Arcade, which extends your play time, Far Cry 5 is the ultimate open-world first person shooter.*|PS4
***GameSpot*** - [Edmond Tran](http://opencritic.com/critic/1422/edmond-tran)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/far-cry-5-review-in-progress/1900-6416885/)|*[Provisional Score] With smart changes to exploration, discovery, and progression, Far Cry 5 makes engaging and experimenting with its gorgeous open world more exciting than ever.*|PC
**CGMagazine** - [Cole Watson](http://opencritic.com/critic/1928/cole-watson)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://www.cgmagonline.com/reviews/far-cry-5-sony-ps4-review/)|*Far Cry 5 was a blast from start to finish, pulling me into the experience instantly with an Americana rich world full of memorable characters and built with a strong core of addictive first-person gameplay.*|PS4
**Attack of the Fanboy** - [William Schwartz](http://opencritic.com/critic/596/william-schwartz)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5 stars](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/far-cry-5/)|*We didn't get it with the last two entries in the series, but Far Cry 5 feels like the generational leap that fans have been waiting for.  This installment certainly feels like the biggest in terms of content and it just might be the best Far Cry game to date.*|XB1
**Saudi Gamer** -[ صالح بازرعة](http://opencritic.com/critic/3302/-) - *Arabic*|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://saudigamer.com/review/far-cry-5/)|*Far Cry 5 delivers on what has made the series special, with freeform gameplay, a hostile environment replete with colorful characters and a generous amount of content in both missions and activities, in addition to numerous gameplay tweaks and improvements. It might not be a huge departure from the series, but it definitely is the most polished one so far.*|PS4
**TechRaptor** - [Samuel Guglielmo](http://opencritic.com/critic/1991/samuel-guglielmo)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://techraptor.net/content/far-cry-5-review)|*Far Cry 5 combines a wonderful setting and interesting characters with extremely fun gameplay, a fantastic open world full of great side quests, and lovely presentation. It also has a powerful level editor that could make some real gems. This is a new standout for the series, as it's easily the best Far Cry has been.*|PS4
**GamingTrend** - [Ron Burke](http://opencritic.com/critic/483/ron-burke)|90 ~ [90 / 100](http://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/the-rise-of-terror-in-hope-county-far-cry-5-review/)|*With new gameplay mechanics, overhauled progression systems, a strong narrative, and the Guns/Friends for Hire system, Far Cry 5 is the overhaul that the series desperately needed. It is easily the best of the series, and represents a positive step in a new direction. Come for the storyline, stay for the co-op chaos.*|PS4
**GamingBolt** - [Shubhankar Parijat](http://opencritic.com/critic/1198/shubhankar-parijat)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/far-cry-5-review)|*Far Cry 5's open-ended and free-form brand of exploration, chaotic and emergent combat, immersive setting, and inherently fascinating narrative premise all come together in what is easily the best Far Cry game ever.*|PS4
**Game Rant** - [Dalton Cooper](http://opencritic.com/critic/260/dalton-cooper)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5](https://gamerant.com/far-cry-5-review/)|*Far Cry 5 may not have much in the way of revolutionary new ideas, but it streamlines Ubisoft's open world formula and delivers one of the best games in the series.*|PS4
**3DNews** - [Алексей Лихачев](http://opencritic.com/critic/4018/-) - *Russian*|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://3dnews.ru/967472)|*A wonderful continuation of the series. Far Cry 5 adjusted a well-known formula enough to make the chase after brilliant antagonists very fun and exciting.*|PS4
**VideoGamer** - [Colm Ahern](http://opencritic.com/critic/577/colm-ahern)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://www.videogamer.com//reviews/far-cry-5-review)|*In its quieter moments Hope County is a picturesque backdrop to terrific Prepper Stash puzzles, and an over-the-top fantasy playground when the volume is turned up. Taking on Eden's Gate is compelling, horrific, and an awful lot of fun.*|XB1
**AusGamers** - [Steve Farrelly](http://opencritic.com/critic/1378/steve-farrelly)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://www.ausgamers.com/games/far-cry-5/review/)|*And so what we get in the end is a Far Cry that is both structured and full of open player-agency and emergent activity. It’s a game whose game-world is designed for you to love and adore, to become intimate and at one with; to be equally terrified of.*|XB1
**Fenix Bazaar** - [Gaetano Prestia](http://opencritic.com/critic/3159/gaetano-prestia)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://fenixbazaar.com/2018/03/26/far-cry-5-review-theres-hope-for-us-yet/)|*[Provisional Score] Brimming with confidence, overflowing with content, and firmly established among the genre’s best, Far Cry 5 stakes early claim as one of the year’s best. You don’t want to miss the sheer insanity of Hope County, Montana.*|PS4
**Stevivor** - [Ben Salter](http://opencritic.com/critic/3160/ben-salter)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/far-cry-5-review-god-guns-goons-welcome-hope-county/)|*Far Cry 5 is the thoughtful next step in a series renowned for shooting first and thinking second. The villains are devious, the world is intriguing and the wild animals remind you who owns the land. It takes the Far Cry blueprint and expands the highlights while changing the sliders on aspects that became overused to craft not only the best Far Cry game, but one of the best open worlds to explore this generation, whether alone or with a little help from a friend (or AI dog).*|XB1
**Dualshockers** - [Lou Contaldi](http://opencritic.com/critic/1777/lou-contaldi)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://www.dualshockers.com/far-cry-5-ps4-pro-review-pc-xbox-one/)|*Far Cry 5 isn't revolutionizing open world gaming, but it is a perfection of one of Ubisoft's most noteworthy series. With a captivating scenario, diverse gameplay options, breathtaking background, and a colorful cast of characters, Far Cry 5 is primed as one of 2018's earliest Game of the Year contenders, and potentially the best title in the series to date. Through more thoroughly leaning into the concepts of open-world design, Ubisoft has managed to craft a game that will really scratch your itch for exploration.*|PS4
**GearNuke** - [Khurram Imtiaz](http://opencritic.com/critic/2810/khurram-imtiaz)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://gearnuke.com/far-cry-5-review-ps4/)|*Far Cry series has finally made its return after a long wait, and it’s a bigger and more ambitious attempt on the same old classic Far Cry formula that the fans have grown to love across the numerous games.*|PS4
***IGN*** - [Daemon Hatfield](http://opencritic.com/critic/228/daemon-hatfield)|89 ~ [8.9 / 10](http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/26/far-cry-5-review)|*Far Cry 5 is another wide-open playground with all the necessary ingredients for causing a real ruckus: loads of enemies and allies, temperamental wildlife, and plenty of explosions.*|PS4, XB1
**Cerealkillerz** - [Gabriel Bogdan](http://opencritic.com/critic/3388/gabriel-bogdan) - *German*|89 ~ [8.9 / 10](http://cerealkillerz.org/far-cry-5-ps4-review-little-big-hope-county/)|*Despite a frustrating AI and a strong focus on Online Co-Op/Far Cry Arcade, Far Cry 5 is probably the best Far Cry experience so far. From a intuitive exploration over a varied open world and lots of amusing and crazy moments this game got everything that fans love about the series. It's still open how much long-term motivation the map editor and live events will offer but Far Cry Fans will be entertained for about 15-20 hours.*|PS4
**Elite Gamer** - [Vinny Fanneran](http://opencritic.com/critic/4098/vinny-fanneran)|89 ~ [8.9 / 10](https://elitegamer.com/2018/03/26/far-cry-5-review-wildlands-does-north-america/)|*A believable but no less intense story with tight gameplay set in a notably detailed and beautiful open world. Ubisoft have done an incredible job of refreshing another of their biggest franchises.*|XB1
**Pittsburgh Post-Gazette** - [Max Parker](http://opencritic.com/critic/1351/max-parker)|88 ~ [8.8 / 10](http://communityvoices.post-gazette.com/arts-entertainment-living/the-game-guy/item/41301-far-cry-5-review-a-new-wild-world)|*There are few open world games that can match the pure escapism of the ""Far Cry"" presentation. With a few sanded edges, the gameplay can match that presentation.*|
**IGN Italy** - [Gianluca Loggia](http://opencritic.com/critic/3496/gianluca-loggia) - *Italian*|86 ~ [8.6 / 10](http://it.ign.com/far-cry-5-ps4/138254/review/far-cry-5-la-recensione)|*Far Cry 5, following the steps of the previous episodes, offers a very large map to explore and a lot of things to do, with a good first person shooter experience and interesting action/stealth possibilities. The game is not perfect in all of its aspects, but it's often very funny and always enjoyable, with a very fascinating and unique antagonist.*|PS4
**PowerUp!** - [Leo Stevenson](http://opencritic.com/critic/3173/leo-stevenson)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](https://powerup-gaming.com/2018/03/26/far-cry-5-review/)|*Far Cry 5 is a brilliantly put together, sandbox game. Its focus remains on the various shades of human sanity, but rather than focus on the easily recognized evils, it forces players to look at a far more insidious kind.*|PS4
***GamesBeat*** - [Jeff Grubb](http://opencritic.com/critic/1047/jeff-grubb)|85 ~ [85 / 100](https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/26/far-cry-5-review-its-about-filling-in-the-gaps/)|*Far Cry 5 is mechanically sound and varied. You'll find something that entertains you, and Ubisoft has nailed all of the underlying elements of character and world progression. At the same time, it squanders some decent writing because it can't decide what kind of game it is.*|
**Worth Playing** - [Redmond Carolipio](http://opencritic.com/critic/291/redmond-carolipio)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](http://worthplaying.com/article/2018/3/26/reviews/107930/)|*What I found there was a redneck action odyssey I didn't ask for and never knew I wanted, until I found myself in the late hours of the night raiding enemy outposts with a trained bear and a shotgun-bearing pyromaniac.*|PS4
**Xbox Achievements** - [Richard Walker](http://opencritic.com/critic/679/richard-walker)|85 ~ [85 / 100](http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/far-cry-5/review/)|*From its tense opening to its blistering conclusion, Far Cry 5 is another cracking installment in the series, streamlining some of the hunting elements and putting co-op up front for both the campaign and the bottomless Far Cry Arcade. The narrative and characters will live on in the memory once you're done and dusted too, as will the insane random minute-to-minute moments that always succeed in making Far Cry so unique.*|XB1
**The Games Machine** - [Ivan Conte](http://opencritic.com/critic/3691/ivan-conte) - *Italian*|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/far-cry-5/far-cry-5-recensione-pc-ps4-xbox-one/)|*We cannot deny that Far Cry 5 is another ""more of the same"", warts and all, but the religious fanatic setting is spot-on, and Montana in simply wonderful (and Joseph Seed is one of the best villains the series has ever had). The open-world approach of the game works as usual, and the more you look at it as a big, sumptuous playground, the better. The Arcade mode has a lot, a lot of potential that will show its best in the upcoming weeks and months, when the community will start toying with the powerful editor. Enough as it is, Far Cry 5 is an excellent chapter in the series.*|PS4
**Heavy.com** - [Collin MacGregor](http://opencritic.com/critic/2112/collin-macgregor)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](https://heavy.com/games/2018/03/far-cry-5-review/)|*The level of freedom and creativity offered to players alongside the shockingly rich story makes Far Cry 5 an extremely memorable ride.*|PS4
**Gadgets 360** - [Rishi Alwani](http://opencritic.com/critic/1352/rishi-alwani)|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/far-cry-5-review-xbox-one-x-ps4-pc-windows-1828775)|*These issues notwithstanding, Far Cry 5 is a welcome entry in a series that's been consistently entertaining over the years. The campaign is filled with memorable characters, robust progression, and action galore that all combine to make it a treat to play.*|XB1
**Gameblog** - [Gianni Molinaro](http://opencritic.com/critic/3738/gianni-molinaro) - *French*|80 ~ [8 / 10](http://www.gameblog.fr/tests/3014-far-cry-5-ps4-xb1-pc)|*It seems like Far Cry 5 tries hard to be different in some ways. But in the end, it is obvious it doesn't want to - it can't  - step too far from its predecessors. There's a feeling that even though its world is new, appealling, offers some good tweaks, a magnificient set of allies and villains, and a potentially unlimited content in Arcade mode, we still have the same game flawed with the same A.I. problems, we still complete the same kind of missions and see the same animations. As we sure can have fun and witness a fantastic ending, this can be forgiven. Until next time.*|PS4
***GamesRadar+*** - [Leon Hurley](http://opencritic.com/critic/984/leon-hurley)|80 ~ [4 / 5 stars](https://www.gamesradar.com/far-cry-5-review/)|*A polished and refined installment that values your time more than the previous games and keeps the focus on entertaining you throughout.*|
**Spaziogames** - [Matteo Bussani](http://opencritic.com/critic/3768/matteo-bussani) - *Italian*|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/recensioni_videogiochi/console_multi_piattaforma/22228/far-cry-5-la-recensione-del-capitolo-allinsegna-del-fanatismo-religiosa.aspx)|*Far Cry 5 brings the player in a Montana Valley controlled by a religious fanatic group . The gameplay is solid and it is related to the past of the series. The game lasts 25 hours, guided by a non-linear storyline, and arcade mode is a solid way to increase the offer of the game.*|PC
**Metro GameCentral** - [GameCentral](http://opencritic.com/outlet/75/metro-gamecentral)|80 ~ [8 / 10](http://metro.co.uk/2018/03/26/far-cry-5-review-american-violence-7417274/)|*The best Far Cry yet and one of the best open world shooters of any kind, with an impressive variety of missions and non-linear structure.*|PS4
**Zoomg** - [Mohsen Vaziri](http://opencritic.com/critic/3547/mohsen-vaziri) - *Persian*|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://www.zoomg.ir/2018/3/25/273317/far-cry-5-review/)|*Far Cry 5 is one of the best entries in this series. Guns for hire is a great addition to the game and the world always have something to offer. If the game had better AI and story had focused only on main antagonist Far Cry 5 could be something like Far Cry 3.*|PS4
**Hardcore Gamer** - [Chris Shive](http://opencritic.com/critic/1804/chris-shive)|80 ~ [4 / 5](https://www.hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=294249)|*Far Cry 5 doesn't deviate too much from the Far Cry formula, simply expanding upon what the series is known for.*|PS4
**M3** - [Billy Ekblom](http://opencritic.com/critic/3359/billy-ekblom) - *Swedish*|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://m3.idg.se/2.1022/1.699913/far-cry-5)|*Far Cry 5 is an epic soundbox experience, driven by the joy of exploration and all-out chaotic gunplay. It's all good fun, but also very familiar, and we can't help but wonder what would have been if Ubisoft put more story-driven elements into the game.*|PS4
**GamePro** - [Hannes Rossow](http://opencritic.com/critic/3625/hannes-rossow)|80 ~ [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/far-cry-5-ubisoft-laesst-die-kirche-im-dorf,3327784.html)|*A usual entertaining Far Cry game, that leaves a lot to be desired in terms of villain and story.*|PS4
**GameMAG** - [xtr](http://opencritic.com/outlet/459/gamemag) - *Russian*|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://gamemag.ru/reviews/far-cry-5)|*Far Cry 5 plays best in co-op with a friend thanks to many crazy situations and fun moments. The basic story is not bad, but Ubisoft is copying itself and amount of recycled elements can upset someone. Still, excellent graphics, helicopter missions, treasure hunts and many other things make Far Cry 5 a good game.*|PS4
**GameSkinny** - [Ty Arthur](http://opencritic.com/critic/2872/ty-arthur)|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://www.gameskinny.com/7p0n3/far-cry-5-review-almost-as-crazy-as-real-montana-but-a-lot-more-fun)|*Ready to plow through herds of bison with a death tractor and then get into a flamethrower fight before taking some relaxation time to go fishing? That's Far Cry 5 in a nutshell.*|XB1
**Twinfinite** - [Chris Jecks](http://opencritic.com/critic/92/chris-jecks)|80 ~ [8 / 10](http://twinfinite.net/2018/03/far-cry-5-review/)|*Far Cry 5 is exactly that – more Far Cry. If you’ve never been a fan of the series, this doesn’t do anything to change your mind. If you loved liberating outposts and blowing shit up in the Himalayas, you’ll enjoy doing it in Hope County, too. Its sprawling world, varied missions, and memorable characters all make for an incredibly entertaining experience, and helped me to overlook the niggling technical issues and occasional frustrating fetch quests in my 30+ hours in Montana.*|PS4
***Easy Allies*** - [Brandon Jones](http://opencritic.com/critic/1433/brandon-jones)|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5FwTjFb2nU)|*Far Cry 5 will try to convince you the world is coming to an end. While the threat of the Eden’s Gate cult is ever-present, what we value most from our time traveling through Hope County are the individual encounters with clever quest-givers, our favorite specialists, or a trusty co-op buddy. It’s a shame the story unnecessarily brings things down to such a dark place, spontaneously interrupting your thrill-seeking pursuits with nothing but bad vibes. Far Cry 5 is like the 4th of July. There’s some serious subject matter being considered, but the experience is mostly about blowing stuff up.*|PS4
***PC Gamer*** - [Christopher Livingston](http://opencritic.com/critic/710/christopher-livingston)|80 ~ [80 / 100](https://www.pcgamer.com/far-cry-5-review/)|*The wonderful chaos of the open world and your choice of how to tackle it is occasionally stifled by bad boss fights and worse boss speeches.*|PC 
***Gamestar*** - [Dimitry Halley](http://opencritic.com/critic/3633/dimitry-halley) - *German*|79 ~ [79 / 100](https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/far-cry-5-kult-geht-anders,3327790.html)|*Despite the interesting cultist scenario, Far Cry 5 only remains a good shooter with a miserably disappointing story line.*|PC
**Gamersky** - [不倒翁蜀黍](http://opencritic.com/critic/4897/-) - *Chinese*|78 ~ [7.8 / 10](http://www.gamersky.com/review/201803/1028703.shtml)|*Playing Ubisoft's Far Cry 5 is just like chewing McDonald's Big Mac. It's really appetizing but never surprises me. I already know what it tastes like before actually biting, considering all the Big Mac are made by the same recipe. So does Far Cry 5.*|XB1
***Game Informer*** - [Jeff Cork](http://opencritic.com/critic/1034/jeff-cork)|75 ~ [7.5 / 10](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_5/b/playstation4/archive/2018/03/26/far-cry-5-game-informer-review-big-sigh-country.aspx)|*Virtually everything about Far Cry 5 is thoroughly okay. For a series that has provided so many thrills and surprises, that's a major disappointment.*|PS4
***Destructoid*** - [Raymond Porreca](http://opencritic.com/critic/2577/raymond-porreca)|75 ~ [7.5 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-far-cry-5-495917.phtml)|*Far Cry 5 is a solid first-person shooter set in a vibrant, breathtaking location. It plays well, looks great, and is packed with enough content to keep players invested in Hope County for a good, long while. Though Joseph Seed and Eden's Gate work better in theory than in practice, the Montana-based doomsday cult marks a departure for the franchise that pays off.*|PS4
**Areajugones** - [Pablo Espinosa](http://opencritic.com/critic/4030/pablo-espinosa) - *Spanish*|75 ~ [7.5 / 10](https://areajugones.sport.es/far-cry-5/analisis/)|*Far Cry 5 is an amazing action game that keeps the essence of the saga. However, its weak plot and map division are elements that make this game inferior to its previous installments.*|PS4
**PlayStation LifeStyle** - [Chandler Wood](http://opencritic.com/critic/178/chandler-wood)|75 ~ [7.5 / 10](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2018/03/26/far-cry-5-review-darkness-in-hope-county-ps4/)|*Far Cry 5 takes steps forward by upping the stakes with a sinister villain and bold new setting, while also stumbling backwards with its non-linear approach and separation of character progression from the world.*|PS4
**Game Revolution** - [Jason Faulkner](http://opencritic.com/critic/448/jason-faulkner)|70 ~ [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/378267-far-cry-5-review-welcome-to-no-hope-county)|*If you liked the other Far Cry games, you'll like this one, because it's more of the same. Some of the series conventions have been taken away (like having to climb towers, thank God), or improved, but it's still very much a Far Cry game.*|PS4
**Digitally Downloaded** - [Ginny W.](http://opencritic.com/outlet/65/digitally-downloaded)|70 ~ [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2018/03/review-far-cry-5-sony-playstation-4.html)|*It never really realises the absurdity of the story that its telling even as it leans into absurd humour in plenty of other areas in the game.*|PS4
**Push Square** - [Glen Fox](http://opencritic.com/critic/4891/glen-fox)|70 ~ [7 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/far_cry_5)|*The best thing we can say about Far Cry 5 is that it's competent, and the worst that it's far too safe.*|PS4
***Polygon*** - [Ben Kuchera](http://opencritic.com/critic/1500/ben-kuchera)|65 ~ [6.5 / 10](https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/26/17164878/far-cry-5-review-ps4-pc-xbox-one)|*What’s left if you have the stomach to ignore the story? A very enjoyable game with an immense number of things to do, a beautifully recreated portion of the United States, and a collection of missions with wildly varying tones and structure. It’s a finely tuned open-world game stapled onto a story that’s insultingly bad.*|PS4, XB1, PC
**Guardian** - [Keza MacDonald](http://opencritic.com/critic/230/keza-macdonald)|60 ~ [3 / 5 stars](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/26/far-cry-5-review-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc-ubisoft)|*A mission to save the US from destruction by a charismatic leader flits between flamethrowing fun and graphic torture in a tonally unpredictable vision.*|
***Giant Bomb*** - [Jeff Gerstmann](http://opencritic.com/critic/663/jeff-gerstmann)|60 ~ [3 / 5 stars](https://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/far-cry-5-review/1900-781/)|*A decent video game undermined by bad pacing, weak characters, and a wishy-washy world view. Play it cooperatively with a friend, ignore the characters and their motivations, and you'll probably have a good time.*|PC
**Slant Magazine** - [Justin Clark](http://opencritic.com/critic/1331/justin-clark)|50 ~ [2.5 / 5 stars](https://www.slantmagazine.com/games/review/far-cry-5)|*Whether intentionally or not, the game gives glory to a brand of grassroots militia fetishism that, just days before the its release, millions of Americans marched in the streets to oppose. Far Cry 5 posits that people would need to be brainwashed to follow men like Joseph Seed, blind to how deep Christian fanaticism already runs, and how many would follow such a man if he only said the word ""please.""*|PS4

|[**AngryCentaurGaming**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg) \- [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter)|Buy \~ [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65bOLMVAXHU)|*First of all, I gotta go say this: If you have Game Pass just go get the game. Everybody else, it is well worth buying. It is worth buying at this price, it is a very enjoyable title, very few bugs, a unique world, and enough content to keep a lot of RPG players busy. You can go through it and maybe 20-25 hours if you just golden pathed it. But if you don't and start going to the side and if you crank that difficulty up, there is a lot of quests here, many of them hidden. I ended up finding a good number of quests sort of off the beaten path. And what you get is just a very enjoyable game, one that has sort of a nice stealth-disguise system, excellent conversation, and enjoyable characters throughout.*|XB1|

|[**TrustedReviews**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/326/trustedreviews) \- [Ryan Jones](https://opencritic.com/critic/6159/ryan-jones)|Review-In-Progress \~ [Review-In-Progress](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds)|*With a wacky dark humour, an expansive upgrade system and branching storylines that make every action feel significant, Obsidian Entertainment looks to set a new bar for RPG games.*|PS4|
|[**EGM**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/38/egm) \- [Josh Harmon](https://opencritic.com/critic/166/josh-harmon)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](https://egmnow.com/the-outer-worlds-review/)|*The Outer Worlds is an impressive spiritual successor to Obsidian's work on Fallout: New Vegas, mixing familiar design elements and the same zany attitude with an imaginative new universe and even deeper role-playing. While you can breeze through the main questline a bit quicker than in similar games, this is the sort of RPG experience you'll want to play through multiple times, with multiple builds, to see all the systems and narrative paths on offer.*|PS4|
|[**We Got This Covered**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/19/we-got-this-covered) \- [Dylan Chaundy](https://opencritic.com/critic/2321/dylan-chaundy)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](https://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/outer-worlds-review/)|*Dizzyingly deep, painstakingly polished, remarkably replayable, and marvelously moreish, The Outer Worlds is one of the most refined and well-written RPGs of the generation*|PS4|
|[**Stevivor**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor) \- [Steve Wright](https://opencritic.com/critic/3165/steve-wright)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/outer-worlds-review-obsidian/)|*The Outer Limits has something for everyone — like intricately designed RPGs that have come before it, I found myself plotting my next moves while at work or even playing hockey, desperate to get back into its world and continue my journey.*|XB1|
|[**TechRaptor**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor) \- [Robert Scarpinito](https://opencritic.com/critic/4537/robert-scarpinito)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-review)|*Obsidian created a universe that's easy to get lost in. The Outer Worlds oozes personality and charm, and the robust character creator encourages multiple playthroughs just to see how different archetypes affect the gameplay.*|PS4|
|[**Game Informer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/35/game-informer) \- [Joe Juba](https://opencritic.com/critic/1029/joe-juba)|93 \~ [9.3 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-outer-worlds/the-outer-worlds-review-good-company)|*Finding your way through (or around) various problems is fun, and a streak of silly humor keeps the tone light enough to counterbalance the darker themes*|PS4|
|[**Xbox Achievements**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements) \- [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb)|92 \~ [92 / 100](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds/review/)|*The Outer Worlds is not only a breath of fresh air and easily one of Obsidian's best ever games, but it's an experience that can truly wear the player choice badge with pride. From the RPG elements to how you play, The Outer Worlds truly is your adventure. Just don't kill anyone's parents in it, okay?*|XB1|
|[**COGconnected**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected) \- [Alexander Thomas](https://opencritic.com/critic/1943/alexander-thomas)|91 \~ [91 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/outer-worlds-review/)|*The Outer Worlds is a first-person shooter like no other. Offering an open world sandbox in which the entire game is your play-thing, I was easily sucked in and didn’t want to leave.*|PS4|
|[**Bloody Disgusting**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/685/bloody-disgusting) \- [Neil Bolt](https://opencritic.com/critic/838/neil-bolt)|90 \~ [4.5 / 5 stars](https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3589910/review-outer-worlds-fantastic-sci-fi-rpg-full-wit-wickedness/)|*It’s a game that keeps on giving as you can miss so much depending on your choices, and in that sense, it’s very much got a classic game feel to it. It’s a mixture of eras poured into a satirical sci-fi romp and it’s such a joy to experience. The Outer Worlds may not be exactly what I thought it would be, but I’m so glad it turned out to be what it is.*|PS4|

The Outer Worlds is more limited from a size standpoint compared to a lot of other open world adventures, but it makes up for it in charm and a succinct vision without much bloat.*|PS4|

Raley](https://opencritic.com/critic/4313/garrick-d-raley)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.gamespace.com/featured/the-outer-worlds-review-for-ps4/)|*I think anybody that enjoyed playing the Fallout games, as well as anyone that has enjoyed the Mass Effect titles, would unequivocally enjoy their time playing The Outer Worlds. I had so much fun exploring every nook and cranny, scouring out-of-the-way locations for loot, taking everything that wasn't nailed down, and immersing myself in the otherworldy locations around Halcyon.*|PS4|

With its sights set squarely on player choice, Obsidian delivers a brilliantly crafted sci-fi adventure that's packed with witty writing, great characters, and a fantastic degree of freedom. Add solid combat and rewarding exploration to the mix, and you've got the recipe for an RPG that begs to replayed time and time again. An essential purchase for fans of the genre.*|PS4|

The Outer Worlds doesn’t tell you a story, it gives you a world full of interesting characters and asks you to tell your own.*|PC|

Its only flaws reside in the combat system and gunplay, but these are easely counterbalanced by the excellent writing and the many possibilities offered to the players. Let's hope Obsidian will explore this setting further, possibly with a much needed sequel.*|PC|

The wealth of lore and world-building details could be a little overwhelming for brand new players, but a little confusion early on shouldn't stop anyone from taking The Outer Worlds for a spin.*|XB1|

You can be yourself from every choice to every build, branching out to experience unique interactions and perks from companions. There's no game out there quite like The Outer Worlds, and you should not miss out on the ride.*|PS4|

And considering that new RPGs from either of those influential developers are still years away, this game couldn’t have been timed any better. It’s not as explorable as one big open world but it still packs in a large portion of flexible quests and conflicts within its series of smaller ones. And the combat, character, and companion systems have enough new spins on existing ideas to make it feel like an homage with its own personality rather than a copy.|PC|

It's not perfect, but it's creative, succinct, compelling and funny in all the right ways. I sincerely hope that this signals the beginning of a new, ongoing franchise because the people and stories of the Halcyon Colony will stick with me for a long time to come.*|PS4|

It's a smaller game, one that focuses on replay value and role play fantasy to really get the most out of the experience.  It's a dense game though, where there's plenty of lore packed into smaller sandbox style areas.  It's up to you to poke around in the corners of these areas to get the most out of it.*|PS4|

Obsidian has built a vibrant and freeing world that is fresh, exciting, and ripe with galactic potential that will hopefully continue being explored in sequels. Even with its shortcomings, its easy to see Obsidian's newest RPG bordering on instant classic status.*||

Obsidian managed to produce a title that is completely carried and elevated by its world(s) and characters. With the amount of interesting interactions filled in each conversation, The Outer Worlds will always beg to be revisited. Sadly, The Outer Worlds shot for the moon and only landed among the stars, thanks to combat that feels like shooting a BB gun at walls of sponge.*|PS4|
|[**RPG Site**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/322/rpg-site) \- [George Foster](https://opencritic.com/critic/2113/george-foster)|80 \~ [8 / 10](http://www.rpgsite.net/review/9110-the-outer-worlds-review)|*Obsidian have crafted a smart, witty, deep RPG experience that feels confident in its own shoes. It keeps its focus on having good role-playing mechanics, whilst still managing to have an involved combat system that improves on what we’ve seen done in the genre before.*|PS4|
|[**TheSixthAxis**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis) \- [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick)|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review/)|*The Outer Worlds is the game that fans have wanted Obsidian Entertainment to make for the better part of a decade. The story is the main attraction here, with Obsidian's witty writing coming to the fore in an interesting and funny interstellar setting. If that's what you look for in your RPGs, The Outer Worlds will not disappoint.*|PS4|
|[**Twinfinite**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/21/twinfinite) \- [Hayes Madsen](https://opencritic.com/critic/1792/hayes-madsen)|80 \~ [4 / 5](https://twinfinite.net/2019/10/the-outer-worlds-review/)|*As a more compact Fallout-like experience The Outer Worlds really works, and I’m already hoping that we’ll get to return to the Halcyon Colony again someday.*|PS4|

Obsidian Entertainment delivers this small window into that alternate reality, a game that prizes picking the right skills to tackle weird and wild situations. The Outer Worlds shines in the writing, but the combat doesn't equally rise to the occasion. Likewise, the planets you visit could use a few more quests or interesting spots to explore. The Outer Worlds is still a fun romp though, something that will hopefully build to something bigger in the future.*|PC|
|[**Spiel Times**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/694/spiel-times) \- [Arkadyuti Bandyopadhyay](https://opencritic.com/critic/6766/arkadyuti-bandyopadhyay)|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://www.spieltimes.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds/)|*Despite having quite a few flaws, the game still stands out in the RPG genre, with the game's writing being instrumental in getting it there.* |PC|

They lack depth, but they are fluffy and easy to enjoy. As I look back on some screenshots as Pippin laser blasts a poor marauder into a pile of dust, I realise that's what The Outer Worlds is to me. If you meet it on those terms, I think you'll enjoy it.*|PC|
|[**Wccftech**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/304/wccftech) \- [Alessio Palumbo](https://opencritic.com/critic/1304/alessio-palumbo)|78 \~ [7.8 / 10](https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/)|*The Outer Worlds is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from Obsidian. The first-person action RPG features a great setting, fantastic writing and remarkable, complex characters to meet. The moment-to-moment gameplay isn't as exciting, though, failing to measure up with the best in the genre. Still, there's plenty to like here as long as you know what you're getting into, not to mention the potential to do much better in a sequel, particularly if the developers had a higher budget to work with.*|XB1|
|[**PCGamesN**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/169/pcgamesn) \- [Dustin Bailey](https://opencritic.com/critic/1612/dustin-bailey)|70 \~ [7 / 10](https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-outer-worlds/review)|*Obsidian's RPG fulfills its potential, but only in fits and starts. Sure, its worst moments are only ever as bad as workmanlike RPG-making, but they make the stretches between some instances of genuine greatness a little more disappointing*|PC|
|[**The Digital Fix**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/17/the-digital-fix) \- [Stephen Hudson](https://opencritic.com/critic/4545/stephen-hudson)|70 \~ [7 / 10](https://www.thedigitalfix.com/gaming/content/22965/the-outer-worlds/)|*Despite an intriguing setting and some solid gun combat, The Outer Worlds borrows too much from the series it's heavily influenced by, leaving it feeling void of originality.*|PS4|
|[**GamingTrend**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/102/gamingtrend) \- [Bryan Lawver](https://opencritic.com/critic/5026/bryan-lawver)|65 \~ [65 / 100](https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/gilded-space-age-the-outer-world-review/)|*For better or worse, The Outer Worlds is a perfectly middle-of-the-road open-world RPG. It doesn't take any big risks, but that also keeps it from falling on its face. Despite some great writing, the game doesn't have much to say about the corporate dystopia it establishes, ultimately playing it too safe to justify the premise. Obsidian's expertise with the genre makes The Outer Worlds a competent RPG, if not an especially interesting one.*|PS4|

|**AngryCentaurGaming** \- [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter)|Buy \~ [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdGBcljUnMs)|*A great game, held back a bit by repeating missions structure and a couple small issues.*|PS4|
|**VG247** \- [Alex Donaldson](https://opencritic.com/critic/1621/alex-donaldson)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.vg247.com/2018/09/04/spider-man-review-ps4-marvel/)|*Spider-Man is at its best when you're mid-flow. It's a game that can capture that awesome trance-like feeling where you're so in tune with the rhythm of swinging and hopping between buildings or dodging, countering and attacking enemies that everything else melts away. That's when it feels most special, and it's then that what Insomniac has achieved here is most plain. Much of its design is familiar, but it appears here in a refined, polished form that makes it an easy recommendation.*|PS4|
|**Eurogamer** \- [Christian Donlan](https://opencritic.com/critic/753/christian-donlan)|Recommended \~ [Recommended](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-09-04-marvels-spider-man-review)|*A rare harmony of developer and licence makes Insomniac's open-worlder a total treat.*|PS4|
|**Polygon** \- [Chelsea Stark](https://opencritic.com/critic/3792/chelsea-stark)|Recommended \~ [Recommended](https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/4/17814774/spider-man-review-ps4-marvel)|*Filled with heart-pounding, high-flying action, Spider-Man is a polished, fun and sometimes frustrating PS4 exclusive*|PS4|
|**Ars Technica** \- [Sam Machkovech](https://opencritic.com/critic/2302/sam-machkovech)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/spider-man-ps4-review-does-whatever-a-spider-can-and-then-some/)|*Want a Marvel Studios twist on open-world superhero action? Then Spider-Man is a must-buy. Otherwise, try it.*|PS4|
|**Kotaku** \- [Ethan Gach](https://opencritic.com/critic/1454/ethan-gach)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://kotaku.com/spider-man-the-kotaku-review-1828796781)|*As a playground for one of the most idiosyncratic superheroes of all time, Marvel's Spider-Man is sheer bliss. It's a sandbox platformer first and foremost, and a damn good one. Throughout playing the game I was constantly hounded by the question of whether this—sublime superhero traversal in a gorgeous, idealized version of New York—were enough. After countless hours later spent cleaning up every last icon on the map, I'm convinced they are.*|PS4|
|**Skill Up** \- [Ralph Panebianco](https://opencritic.com/critic/5428/ralph-panebianco)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bbLmIjI-wc)||PS4|
|**CNET** \- [Jeff Bakalar](https://www.cnet.com/profiles/jbakalar/)|Unscored - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/marvel-s-spider-man-review/?utm_source=reddit.com)|*Insomniac Games has laid an excellent foundation for more Spider-Man games down the road. This first entry demonstrates that the veteran studio can tackle Spidey's combat in a compelling way and create some genuinely astonishing action sequences with top-tier visuals to match. I'll be looking for more gameplay depth and variation to round out the entire experience next time and more motivation to see Spider-Man's next chapter all the way through. By no means is Spider-Man dead on arrival, it just leaves some room for improvement. This feels like a game that will have a great sequel.*|PS4|
|**Gadgets 360** \- [Rishi Alwani](https://opencritic.com/critic/1352/rishi-alwani)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/spiderman-review-ps4-download-game-length-release-date-1911146)|*Clocking in at around 30 hours to complete Spider-Man's main storyline, and more if you decide to go after everything else the game has to offer, Spider-Man for PS4 isn't just triumph for video games. It's quite possibly the definitive interpretation of the superhero in any medium.*|PS4|
|**GameZone** \- [Cade Onder](https://opencritic.com/critic/2098/cade-onder)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.gamezone.com/reviews/review-marvels-spider-man-is-nothing-short-of-spectacular/)|*With an emotionally rich story, gameplay that fulfills childlike dreams of being a superhero, and an engaging world with no shortage of puddles, Marvel's Spider-Man is not only the definitive Spider-Man game but one of the best games of the generation. Insomniac's not playing the ""greatest hits"" of Spider-Man, they're making a new era of the webhead that will go down as a groundbreaking age in superhero gaming.*|PS4|
|**Daily Mirror** \- [JC Suttun](https://opencritic.com/critic/4401/jc-suttun)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/spider-man-ps4-review-marvels-13189735)|*With a fresh take on the character in both story terms and gameplay, Insomniac have delivered a superb experience that harks back to when Rocksteady revitalized Batman with Arkham Asylum. Marvel's Spider-Man is a brilliant, thoroughly needed entry in the superhero genre that is a must play whether you're a hardcore comics fan, casual Spidey aficionado or simply a lover of action adventures.*|PS4|
|**Press Start** \- [Brodie Gibbons](https://opencritic.com/critic/3662/brodie-gibbons)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2018/09/05/spider-man-review-ps4/)|*It's hard to fault Marvel's Spider-Man as Insomniac has taken their game to the next level. As a developer, they have gone from strength to strength and Spider-Man is a culmination of their past hits. There's a stunning verticality that compliments the game's watertight mechanics and, despite the literal boundaries, still makes the city seem boundless. If you're a Marvel die-hard, there's enough fanfare here to sink a ship as Spider-Man emerges as the new gold standard. Spider-Man is, without question, the best superhero game ever.*|PS4|
|**COGconnected** \- [Paul Sullivan](https://opencritic.com/critic/808/paul-sullivan)|100 \~ [100 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/spider-man-review/)|*I can’t stop thinking about this game. If I’m not playing it, I want to be. The web-slinging is brilliant, the combat is deceptively deep and diverse, and there are a million things to do. The story is emotional, resonant, and teases fans of the series in countless ways. It’s one of the best looking games of the year, and honestly, one of the best games I’ve ever played, full stop.*|PS4|
|**Cheat Code Central** \- [Jenni Lada](https://opencritic.com/critic/342/jenni-lada)|98 \~ [4.9 / 5.0](http://www.cheatcc.com/ps4/rev/marvelsspidermanreview.html)|*When I played Marvel’s Spider-Man, one thing was clear: Insomniac Games did its homework. The lore is spot on and the pacing makes it feel like someone is going through Spider-Man comics brought to life. The missions show how amazing Spider-Man is at beating up groups of enemies, stealthily managing situations, investigating, inventing, and besting bosses. The sidequests give you excuses to explore the city and swing through the skies. I do wish that the differences between difficulty levels was a little more obvious, as I felt the Friendly difficulty level might not have been amiable enough to allow less skilled or younger players to enjoy the adventure. Overall, Marvel’s Spider-Man does the hero justice.*|PS4|
|**Areajugones** \- [Juan Linares](https://opencritic.com/critic/3449/juan-linares) \- *Spanish*|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://areajugones.sport.es/spider-man/analisis-y-video-analisis-de-marvels-spider-man/)|*Marvel's Spider-Man is one of the best exclusive games for the PS4 and one of the best games in 2018 so far. Its world has managed to surprise us due to the huge amount of content it possesses as well as because of its funny and deep gameplay. Finally, its visual level is movie-like and keeps the player engaged by means of a great story.*|PS4|
|**Game Informer** \- [Andrew Reiner](https://opencritic.com/critic/1030/andrew-reiner)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/spider-man/spinning-an-amazing-web)|*The story shines as brightly as the gameplay – both deliver heart-pounding excitement.*|PS4|
|**PlayStation Universe** \- [John-Paul Jones](https://opencritic.com/critic/843/john-paul-jones)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/ps4-spider-man/)|*A welcome return for PlayStation's original superhero icon, Insomniac Games have not just given us another sublime PlayStation exclusive but also the best superhero blockbuster the PS4 has ever seen. Spider-Man is a thunderous, essential triumph that bleeds cinematic splendor from every digital pore. Every PS4 owner needs to have Spider-Man in their collection.*|PS4|
|**GamesBeat** \- [Mike Minotti](https://opencritic.com/critic/1057/mike-minotti)|95 \~ [95 / 100](https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/04/marvels-spider-man-review-spideys-best-game-yet/)|*Marvel’s Spider-Man is the best super hero game since Batman: Arkham Asylum. The swinging, combat, and New York City itself come together to create a Spider-Man experience that is exciting and faithful to the character. If you’ve ever been a fan of Spidey, you need to check out his newest digital adventure. This is now the best Spider-Man game, taking the crown from Spider-Man 2. It is also one of the PlayStation 4’s best exclusives and one of the best super hero games ever.*|PS4|
|**Gaming Nexus** \- [Charles Husemann](https://opencritic.com/critic/531/charles-husemann)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/5777/Spider-Man/)|*Insomniac has delivered one of the best Spider-Man games to date by nailing all of the details—big and small.*|PS4|
|**God is a Geek** \- [Chris White](https://opencritic.com/critic/582/chris-white)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-ps4-review/)|*Everything I hoped it would be and more. Marvel's Spider-Man provides us lots to do, a great story, and some of the best visuals available on the PS4.*|PS4|
|**Just Push Start** \- [Grant E. Gaines](https://opencritic.com/critic/901/grant-e-gaines)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.justpushstart.com/2018/09/marvels-spider-man-review/)|*Marvel’s Spider-Man isn’t perfect, but that doesn’t stop it from being a fantastic experience. The story takes a while to get going but the end is more than worth the wait. Add in a fun, fluid and flashy combat system and it makes for a delightful journey. Sure, at times it drags, like during the forced stealth sections, but these are not enough to ruin the experience. Between all these things, fantastic graphics, a good selection of costumes and more, I can not suggest Marvel’s Spider-Man enough. Even if you’re like me and not the biggest Spider-Man fan, it’s a good enough experience to make it worth your time.*|PS4|
|**Stevivor** \- [Steve Wright](https://opencritic.com/critic/3165/steve-wright)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/spider-man-review-hero-game-needed/)|*Spider-Man is a heroic masterpiece, and one certainly worth playing.*|PS4|
|**Easy Allies** \- [Brandon Jones](https://opencritic.com/critic/1433/brandon-jones)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlFfpYw5fjE)|*Insomniac Games has used their power responsibly while translating their vision of Spider-Man, and they’ve created his largest and most detailed adventure to date. They’ve taken lessons from their previous action-adventures, along with recent successful franchises in the super hero genre, showcasing what’s possible not only for Spider-Man, but for all comic book characters in this generation of games.* [Written](https://easyallies.com/#!/review/marvels-spiderman)|PS4|
|**Oyungezer Online** \- [Yasin İlgün](https://opencritic.com/critic/3619/yasin-lg-n) \- *Turkish*|93 \~ [93 / 100](http://oyungezer.com.tr/haber/54182-marvel-s-spider-man-inceleme)|*Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man masterfully succeeds in every attempt it makes to tell an ""Amazing, Spectecular"" story. A must play!*|PS4|
|**Worth Playing** \- [Redmond Carolipio](https://opencritic.com/critic/291/redmond-carolipio)|93 \~ [9.3 / 10](http://worthplaying.com/article/2018/9/4/reviews/110793/)|*Marvel's Spider-Man does what a lot of good art does, which is examine techniques and concepts that work well, and then blend and refine them to create something unique to itself and possibly greater. I've made this point before: Art and artists have built on and inspired each other since the beginning of time. So yes, I've heard and seen the Spidey/Arkham hot takes, and I ended up not caring at all because at no point did I forget I was playing a Spider-Man experience. I was too busy swinging around in Manhattan, with buildings whipping by as I tailed a police pursuit, thinking about how right it all felt.*|PS4|
|**GameSpot** \- [Edmond Tran](https://opencritic.com/critic/1422/edmond-tran)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-review-amazing-fantasy/1900-6416975/)|*A spectacular cinematic presentation and sensational core mechanics help Insomniac's take on a Spider-Man game shine, in spite of some unimaginative open-world activities.*|PS4|
|**GamesRadar+** \- [Leon Hurley](https://opencritic.com/critic/984/leon-hurley)|90 \~ [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.gamesradar.com/marvel-spider-man-ps4-review/)|*An immensely enjoyable and fun to play superhero adventure.*|PS4|
|**EGM** \- [Josh Harmon](https://opencritic.com/critic/166/josh-harmon)|90 \~ [9 / 10](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/marvels-spider-man-review/)|*Marvel's Spider-Man mixes the prestige ambitions of a Sony exclusive with the hyperkinetic fun of a great superhero game. It's not a pairing you'd expect to work, but it mostly does here, though some aspects of the open-world design, like repetitive side content, let down the overall package.*|PS4|
|**NEOsite** \- [Paweł Musiolik](https://opencritic.com/critic/3745/pawe-musiolik) \- *Polish*|90 \~ [9 / 10](http://www.neosite.pl/recenzje/3139/recenzja-spider-man-ps4.html)|*Spider-Man from Insomniac is for games what Homecoming is for movies. A piece of great game with amazing graphics. Fans of Man-Spider will be ecstatic. The others will be delighted with the quality of the whole game. Strong contender for GOTY.*|PS4|
|**Shacknews** \- [Kevin Tucker](https://opencritic.com/critic/1844/kevin-tucker)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/107038/marvels-spider-man-review-simply-spectacular)|*Marvel's Spider-Man is at once a fantastic action game, a dramatic story-driven adventure, and a love letter to fans of Marvel's ever-endearing wall-crawler. It's also one of the strongest titles in Insomniac Games' catalog, and will no doubt be counted not only among the best games of 2018, but also among the best PlayStation 4 exclusives ever released.*|PS4|
|**TrueGaming** \- [عمر العمودي](https://opencritic.com/critic/3265/-) \- *Arabic*|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.true-gaming.net/home/377883/)|*The swing between New York's buildings has never been so great. No previous game of Spider-Man has provided this kind of excellence with play style and storytelling.*|PS4|
|**USgamer** \- [Mike Williams](https://opencritic.com/critic/299/mike-williams)|90 \~ [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/spider-man-review)|*Insomniac Games takes Marvel's most popular character for a spin and the results are fantastic. The developer establishes its own Spider-Man with a unique supporting cast and a beautiful recreation of New York to play around in. This is an absolutely beautiful game, with solid combat and a great story. Most of all, it really sells the feeling of being Spider-Man. The gaming history of Spider-Man has been uneven, but this is an amazing entry in that history. Pun intended.*|PS4|
|**Daily Dot** \- [AJ Moser](https://opencritic.com/critic/1794/aj-moser)|90 \~ [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/marvel-spider-man-game-review/)|*Every prominent character featured comes across as a natural fit for the world Insomniac have built, as well as Marvel's detailed history. In a similar way, this feels like the most authentic Spider-Man game that's ever been made. It captures every aspect of the hero and his secret identity that fans have come to love, all while delivering a lengthy experience that feels like a childhood dream of defying gravity finally come to fruition.*|PS4|
|**Hardcore Gamer** \- [Adam Beck](https://opencritic.com/critic/873/adam-beck)|90 \~ [4.5 / 5](https://www.hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=310757)|*Insomniac Games has created the single greatest Spider-Man game and one of the best based on a comic book.*|PS4|
|**Critical Hit** \- [Darryn Bonthuys](https://opencritic.com/critic/1229/darryn-bonthuys)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.criticalhit.net/review/marvels-spider-man/)|*Marvel's Spider-Man is charming and energetic, action-packed and surprisingly capable of tugging on your heart strings to deliver a one-two punch to the emotional gut. If you had to sum up Marvel's Spider-Man in one word, nothing would be more apt than…amazing.*|PS4|
|**Next-Gen Gaming Blog** \- [Ben Ward](https://opencritic.com/critic/2308/ben-ward)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.nextgenbase.com/spider-man-review/)|*Overall, Spider-Man is the game that a lot of people hoped it would be. An incredible traversal system that will have ironically been prototyped on a competitor’s exclusive title, a franchise with instant mainstream appeal and a story that, without giving anything away, sets things up nicely for a sequel without feeling lacking, all combine to make Spider-Man a must-play for 2018.*|PS4|
|**PlayStation LifeStyle** \- [Chandler Wood](https://opencritic.com/critic/178/chandler-wood)|90 \~ [9 / 10](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2018/09/04/marvels-spider-man-ps4-review/)|*Marvel's Spider-Man doesn't innovate on the open-world genre, but Insomniac doubled down on creating a spectacular Spider-Man fantasy. It simply feels good to travel through Peter Parker's New York as the webslinger, even if whatever Spidey-suit you choose is covering a competent and entirely expected open-world formula. Filled with more emotion, heart, and humanity than we've seen in superhero adventures before, Insomniac doesn't need to reinvent the open-world wheel. Marvel's Spider-Man embraces the man behind the mask and gives us the best interactive Spider-Man experience to date.*|PS4|
|**Hobby Consolas** \- [Álvaro Alonso](https://opencritic.com/critic/3755/-lvaro-alonso) \- *Spanish*|90 \~ [90 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-marvels-spider-man-ps4-insomniac-games-296383)|*With the speed, agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid, Insomniac brings back the beloved super hero with a game that lacks novelty, but shines in every aspect. Marvel's Spider-Man is amazing, spectacular, sensational and superior to any other wall-crawling, web-slinging video game.*|PS4|
|**Push Square** \- [Glen Fox](https://opencritic.com/critic/4891/glen-fox)|90 \~ [9 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/marvels_spider-man)|*Ultimately, Marvel's Spider-Man is a must-buy, because no matter how you feel about our webbed superhero, this is just an insanely fun game to play, and it's so well put together. Just like the Arkham games did for Batman, this pretty much provides the definitive version of the Spider-Man universe outside of the comics, and leaves us begging to explore more of it in the inevitable sequel. Webslinging is bliss, combat is fantastic fun, and the extra content and collectibles are varied and infrequent enough not to overwhelm. What's more, the plot and characters are an unexpected surprise, with some fantastic performances that are genuinely touching. Marvel's Spider-Man is one of the best games of 2018 so far, and every PS4 owner will feel proud to own it as part of their library.*|PS4|
|**GamingTrend** \- [Pierce Turner](https://opencritic.com/critic/5378/pierce-turner)|90 \~ [90 / 100](http://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/insomniac-thwips-up-the-dream-spider-man-review/)|*I've 100 percent completed the game and unlocked the platinum trophy, but I can't stop swinging through the city and saving people. By the end, it really is your city with your people to help, your landmarks to admire, your jungle to swing though. This is the new benchmark for Spider-Man games and I can't wait to see what Insomniac does next.*|PS4|
|**TheSixthAxis** \- [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick)|90 \~ [9 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/04/marvels-spider-man-review/)|*Marvel's Spider-Man does a spectacular job of making you feel like the ultimate Spider-Man. From swinging through the city at high speed to fighting off legions of enemies by zipping between them and pulling them into the air, its gameplay looks like a scene from the films. It's remarkably well realised in terms of its world, design, and even technically, with short loading times and a rock solid framerate even on the base PlayStation 4. If Spider-Man is your thing then this is an essential purchase.*|PS4|
|**Destructoid** \- [Chris Carter](https://opencritic.com/critic/431/chris-carter)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-spider-man-519782.phtml)|*Spider-Man isn't just a great superhero game, it's a proof of concept for Insomniac as a company. This project shows that they can basically handle pretty much any universe, because if you can accurately recreate Peter Parker's nimbleness and gentle heart you can do anything: and with multiple teasers at the end, I think they'll get that chance.*|PS4|
|**MonsterVine** \- [Spencer Legacy](https://opencritic.com/critic/2164/spencer-legacy)|90 \~ [4.5 / 5](http://monstervine.com/2018/09/marvels-spider-man-review-a-brand-new-day/)|*Marvel's Spider-Man completely understands both the character of Peter Parker, and what it is that makes a Spider-Man game fun. Though it has more than a few technical hiccups, Spider-Man is a fantastic action game that can only improve with future installments.*|PS4|
|**Attack of the Fanboy** \- [William Schwartz](https://opencritic.com/critic/596/william-schwartz)|90 \~ [4.5 / 5 stars](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-ps4-review/)|*Spider-Man games have a long history of being disappointing on some level, but Insomniac has crafted a game worthy of the name.*|PS4|
|**Twinfinite** \- [Chris Jecks](https://opencritic.com/critic/92/chris-jecks)|90 \~ [4.5 / 5](https://twinfinite.net/2018/09/marvels-spider-man-review/)|*After 30 hours, I've wrapped up Spider-Man's story, completed a substantial amount of its side content, and have almost got every suit mod and skill in the game, and I just want to keep playing. Though it has a few minor blemishes here and there, they're never significant enough to really detract from the overall experience.*|PS4|
|**IGN Spain** \- [Juan García](https://opencritic.com/critic/3435/juan-garc-a) \- *Spanish*|88 \~ [8.8 / 10](https://es.ign.com/marvels-spider-man-ps4/138721/review/analisis-de-marvels-spider-man-para-ps4)|*Probably the best Spider-Man game ever done, but still far from being perfect. Insomniac has made an excellent sandbox but its repetitiveness and some technical issues makes this game a bit less stellar.*|PS4|

""Spider-Man"" for PS4 does more than enough to make comic fans and webhead fans happy. It clears the middling bar for Spider-Man games. It's the best Spider-Man game ever made. But, its uninspired narrative keeps it from reaching the heights of the ""Arkham"" series. Admittedly, that's a tough series to top. This is just the beginning for this new vision of Spider-Man and his journey, and his best tales may be waiting around the corner.*|PS4|

Insomniac Games' first foray into the world of Marvel handily delivers on all of that. But what I didn't expect from Spider-Man was to come away feeling just as fulfilled to have inhabited the life of Peter Parker. Aside from a few odd pacing issues, which momentarily took me out of the experience of being a superhero, and a world of optional missions that don't always quite live up to the heft of the main story, Insomniac has delivered a Spider-Man story that both surprised and delighted me, coupled with gameplay that made me feel like Spider-Man nearly every step of the way. The Wall Crawler's open world doesn't consistently deliver the thrilling moments of its main campaign, but the foundation laid here is undoubtedly a spectacular one.*|PS4|

It's a shame, because the combat system and the swinging are two of the best aspects of the game, and the team should have focus on creating more original and complex side adventures, quests and activities to take advantage of the biggest features of Marvel's Spider-Man.*|PS4|

There's also so much content in there that people who want to get that all-important 100 per cent completion have many hours of play time to look forward to. The value of Spider-Man as entertainment can't be questioned, but given that this is a blockbuster experience that has brought in a mammoth amount of resourcing, it was also always going to offer that. Spider-Man was never not going to deliver on its promise, and as much as I enjoyed my time with it, I still hold out hope that at some point the industry will start to question whether empty, superficial fun really is the peak of what its biggest projects can offer.*|PS4|

Buckle in. This post is a biggie, this time covering Rockstar’s latest entry in the series about grand theft…and auto, ""*Grand Theft Auto V""*. There were so many questions about what possible direction this franchise could go, with many rumours seemingly just spouting nonsense and seeing what gained traction, but there were some common themes amongst the leaks. Whether this meant that this was all genuine information, or whether they just all started copying each other, no one will know – although I believe in the latter.

Of course, naturally, with this being Rockstar’s biggest franchise and people desperate for just about any piece of information they could get, legitimate or otherwise, there were hundreds of rumours and leaks for this game, and I will do my best to sift through the endless supply of such and talk about the ones worth mentioning.

Let’s jump in, and here is a **spoiler warning** just in case.  

# May 4, 2010 – E3 Leak Reveals “Grand Theft Auto: Vice City 2”

Way back in 2010, [Game Reactor](https://www.gamereactor.eu/images/?textid=3618&id=210831) shared the alleged lineup for 2010’s E3 event, detailing many games that are going to be revealed, including “*Grand Theft Auto: Vice City 2*”. Other interesting mentions in this “leak” include a new “*Half-Life*”, a sequel to “*Bully*”, and a premature announcement of “*Kingdom Hearts* 3”. 

**Outcome?** *Fake*. Never trust E3 leaks.  

# 26 July, 2010 – Is ""GTAV"" Heading to Hollywood?

[VG247](https://www.vg247.com/2010/07/26/rumour-gta-v-is-set-in%E2%80%A6/) shares with the world the first real hint that the game is headed back to America’s sun-spoilt West Coast. While the article linked does have the tease in a conversation format, it does make mention of Hollywood and that an announcement could be coming soon. Separately, it seems [Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/rockstar-definitely-researching-hollywood) reached out to their own sources and were able to confirm that while Rockstar had been scouting out the Hollywood area, they were unable to confirm for what actual franchise it was for. This wouldn’t be the first time Rockstar has taken ""*GTA""* to Los Angeles, with ""*San Andreas""* already staking that claim.

**Outcome?** *Confirmed.*

As we all know, ""*GTAV""* was set in Los Angeles, and this was our first clue to such.

# February 28, 2011 – Rockstar Registers Web Domains

Courtesy of [XboxAchievements](https://www.xboxachievements.com/news/news-7677-Are-These-Grand-Theft-Auto-V-Web-Domain-Names-.html), due to the original source being taken down, readers are able to treat themselves to a handful of domain names that Rockstar had publicly registered. While on the surface these do not appear to have any mention on the game, as correctly speculated in the article, these turned out to be related to in-game websites and businesses. The one’s registered were;

>[CashForDeadDreams.com](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Cashfordeaddreams.com) \- buy second-hand items from the elderly  
>  
>[SixFigureTemps.com](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Sixfiguretemps.com) \- a job site to make money fast  
>  
>[HammersteinFaust.com](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Hammersteinfaust.com) \- an employment firm business in the game  
>  
>[LifeInvader.com](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Lifeinvader) \-the game's social networking service

The only one registered that doesn’t seem to make an appearance in the game is StopPayingYourMortgage.net, although typing this into an actual browser will take you to Rockstar’s ""*GTAV""* site.

Outcome? Confirmed. As we can see, majority of these actually end up in the game, and I am sure I didn’t even have to provide proof for LifeInvader.

# March 8, 2011 – Casting Call Leaked, Rockstar’s Next Game Codenamed “Rush”

[GameWatcher](https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/2011-07-03-grand-theft-auto-v-cast-leaked) reports that Rockstar have put out a casting call for an “interactive project”, which has been code-named “Rush”. The call seeks performers for the following roles;

>  
>Ira Bernstein – 56 yrs old – publicist for an actress known as America’s newest sweetheart who just so happens to love animals, orphans, drugs and sex. He’s always trying to hide her latest indiscretion.  
>  
>Kevin De Silva – 18 yrs old – Albert’s fat, FPS playing gamer son. Smokes a lot of weed, has anxiety issues and a card for a bad back, very soft, very opinionated. Into making racist comments while playing online.

>Taes Translator – 45 yrs old – VERY STRAIGHT LACED Chinese translator, terrified of his boss’s dad. Male, awkward. Needs to speak Chinese.

A big thank you to [GTA Fandom](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Rush_Casting_Call) for being able to compare the casting call with the game’s final release. Here is a table for those who want to see it;

[Comparison between the casting call and the in-game characters](https://imgur.com/a/CHubDHh)

What else is interesting is that Trevor Phillips, one of the game’s main protagonists, was referred to as Simon here, while Albert De Silva in-game is instead Michael De Santa.

**Outcome?** *Confirmed*. Although the names have changed, you can definitely see the resemblance of many of the characters in the game, and that the majority did appear albeit under a different name.

# March 29, 2011 – Stuntman “Typo” Places ""GTAV"" on his Resume

Declan Mulvey just might have made a typo when he placed ""*Grand Theft Auto V""* on his [resume](https://imgur.com/a/nLjEHGh), saying he did stunt work for the game. However, once eagle-eyed internet sleuths noticed this, according to [Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-02-28-grand-theft-auto-v-leak-a-typo) he told CVG (which I cannot find the article), that it was simply a typo and meant to write “Grand Theft Auto IV”. What is interesting is that this was never corrected, and that he was never in the credits for that game - I think he simply made an oopsie.

**Outcome?** *Confirmed*. Definitely not a typo, as he is credit in ""*GTAV* ""and is not credited in ""*GTAIV""*.

# June 5, 2011 - Play as a Cop in ""GTAV""

As shared on [GTAForums](https://gtaforums.com/topic/478304-gta-5-possible-rumors/), one very controversial rumour regarding the game is that it would feature a story where you play as a rookie cop, working your way up in the ranks to either being the biggest detective in the city, or a cop-gone-rogue. I won’t post the whole “leak” word-for-word, but it sounds like it would have played a lot like L.A. Noire, Rockstar’s detective game also set in Los Angeles.

Based on the rumour, you would start the game as a rookie cop fresh out of the academy, named “Rock or Brock”, and as the story moves along, the player would find himself challenged by his partner who is working in the criminal underworld. The further you progress, the more you would find out that your partner is dirty, but you have a choice to either work with him illegaly or to investigate him - with the endgame resulting in either the player becoming the captain of the police force, or a “dirty cop Kingpin”. Post game, you would continue performing these roles, either abiding and enforcing the law as the captain, or selling contraband and performing other illegal tasks as a kingpin.

Gameplay wise, you would have to respond to dispatches over the radio, perform traffic stops, aid civilians, participate in car chases and even menial traffic tasks such as fining those with faulty brake lights, or speeding. The further you progress, the more involved you get with drug dealers, pimps, and organised crime. If a player wants to stray to the dark side, they can plant and steal evidence, beat informants, and sell drugs and guns.

Other minor details include the return of some characters from *San Andreas* such as “CJ”, being able to go through SWAT training, helicopter training, performing traffic duty, being able to carry a baton, mace, and taser, and being able to handcuff characters through rotating the analogue sticks.

Obviously, you will learn more details about this leak by opening the above forum post, but at the time this was not well received by all, some questioning why a game made famous for allowing players to commit the crimes they want, would now have them play on the other side of the law.

**Outcome?** *Fake*. Nothing turned out to be true, although it did “guess” that the weapon wheel from *Red Dead: Redemption* would return.

# June 20, 2011 – 2012 Release “Pretty Likely” for ""GTAV""

Sources close to Rockstar Games have confirmed with [GameSpot](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-v-development-well-under-way/1100-6320305/) that development is “well under way”, and that a 2012 release is looking pretty likely. Additionally, Gamespot reports that the final touches are being worked on now, such as minigames, and that the scale of the game is vast, saying “It’s the big one”.

Outcome? Plausible. As we know, the game launched in 2013, and it was a “big one”.

# October 25, 2011 – Rockstar Announce ""Grand Theft Auto V""

[Rockstar Games](https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/128788090969001984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E128788090969001984&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgtaforums.com%2Findex.php%3Fapp%3Dcore%26module%3Dsystem%26controller%3Dembed%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FRockstarGames%2Fstatus%2F128788090969001984%3Fs%3D20) announce ""*Grand Theft Auto V""* on Twitter.

# October 25, 2011 – Kotaku Confirm LA setting, Possible Multiple Playable Characters

On the same day that the game is announced, [Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-v-will-be-set-in-los-angeles-may-star-5853279) is able to confirm that ""*GTAV""* will be set in Los Angeles, according to their source who is familiar with the game. As well as talking about the setting, they have other sources that the game will feature multiple playable characters -something that was somewhat touched on with ""*GTAIV*’""s expansions. Not much else to report here.

**Outcome?** *Confirmed*. The game, as we all know, features three playable characters and is set in Rockstar’s version of LA.

# November 2, 2011 – ""Grand Theft Auto V"" Trailer drops

[Get nostalgic here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkkoHAzjnUs&feature=youtu.be)

# November 4, 2011 – Los Santos Map Leaked by Employee?

Thanks to [iGTA5](https://www.igta5.com/forums/topic/810-leaked-los-santos-map/) we can see that an employee apparently shared a version of the game’s map on Twitter, which is viewable [right here](https://imgur.com/a/9gSSfDO). It does show Los Santos and Vinewood, but we know that this map isn't an accurate representation of the released version - it *could* be an early version, but I doubt it. Shortly after posting, the account named “toronotoJack233” got deleted.

**Outcome?** *Fake.*

# November 5, 2011 – UK Magazine Leaks ""GTAV"" Information

As reported on [VG247](https://www.vg247.com/2011/11/05/rumor-supposed-gta-v-information-outed-by-uk-playstation-magazine-employee/), it seems that an employee of a Playstation-focused magazine has leaked some information about the recently announced ""*GTAV*"". There is quite a lot of information, but it basically comes down to;

* A massive world pushing console hardware to the very limits, including more details in the world than ever before such as more NPCs interacting in the world, higher populated areas, and more scenery than any other game. Will also feature interior locations including a mall, college campus, police station, hospital, and underground sewers
* Improved shooting mechanics
* Climbable elements such as ladders and overhangs
* Animals in game
* Cars can be upgraded and repaired, but also have to manage fuel use
* No dating aspect, phone only used for being asked to complete missions
* Rupture a fuel line, then shoot the gas to ignite the fuel line
* Mini-games such as bowling and darts are gone. Now there is basketball, weight training, arm wrestling, cage fights, triathlons, water races, abseiling, sky diving, rock climbing, canoeing
* No children NPCs
* You can use human shields in combat
* There must be witnesses to a crime for you to get a wanted level
* Skills are based on what you do, so for example, the more you ride a motorbike, the better your motorbike skill
* Weather effects include torrential rain fall, sunshine, and even earthquake tremors should feature

It is possible that this is a legitimate leak, some of the points made are representative of some aspects of the final game. However, just looking we can see stuff like rock-climbing, canoeing, and abseiling did not feature, or neither did earthquake tremors. There also was no need to focus on refuelling vehicles, nor was there the ability to use human shields in combat.

**Outcome?** *Plausible*. It is possible that some of this information genuinely came about as a leak, although I don’t feel confident enough in the content to say a verified leak – especially as this came after the trailer.

# November 8, 2011 – More “Leaks” at GTAForums

Another big pile of leaks, this time from a user called OpenSuvivor, and now on the GTAForums. However, the post had been deleted pretty swiftly by the forum moderators, so we will be using this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/m5tdq/opensurvivor_leaks_thread_at_gtaforums/) as our source of information.

Another big list of stuff that I encourage you to read, even if just for old time’s sake. Some interesting notes though mention;

* ""*GTAV""* is landlocked, not an island map, expect to see heavy snow areas with tonnes of snowfall, and deserts
* Bowling is returning
* The story features Mexican drug cartels, and you will be able to cross the border into Mexico
* The protagonist is a divorced male in his mid-50s named Ray, and has two children – Daniel and Skyler, who are both about 10 years old
* The Yucca Desert is on the eastern part of the map, and is infinitely long

As we know, 99% of this list is just completely inaccurate, making it easy to determine the validity of this “leak”. Having said that, it’s still fun to read, and of course at the time there is just no way of knowing if it really is fake.

**Outcome?** *Fake*. I don't think it is coincidence that these recent fake leaks all came out after the trailer.

# March 28, 2012 – Former Rockstar Employee Reveals Information

Another “insider” leak, this time coming from “a friend of someone who recently got sacked from Rockstar North for general misconduct”. While the original document is no longer viewable, it is possible to find out what was written thanks to [Playstation Lifestyle](https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2012/03/28/rumor-former-rockstar-employee-leaks-gta-v-details-including-main-character-and-release-date/). Straight away, looking back, we can make a pretty quick judgement about the validity of this “leak”.

Firstly, they mention that the protagonist “will be one character, and one character alone”. This character’s name is Albert De Silva, and he has a kid Kevin who is pretty much your typical gamer who smokes weed. Our protagonist is the man that we saw in the first trailer, and he will not die at the end of this game.

Next we know that multiplayer lobbies can hold 32 players on Xbox 360 and PS3, and that you will be able to form gangs that level up with reputation, rather than XP. There is an underworld that has a working economy, and the players can take drugs – which will have side effects.

We learn (again) that the map is five times as large as the ""*GTAIV""* map, and that planes are now flyable in this game, unlike the previous ""*GTA""* entry. Guns and cars will also be customisable in this game, allowing suppressors on weapons, and nitrous on cars. Gunfights are now meant to be more realistic, and shooting will be more difficult out of cars due to shaking cameras.

The most interesting piece of information is the mention of the game aiming to be released in May 2013. A release date hadn’t been formally announced at this point by Rockstar, but an end of 2012 release I believe was the consensus at the time.

**Outcome?** *Fake.* Some of these points are a mix whole truths and entirely inaccurate, while some also blur the line.  For example, they got the main character part correct (as we know that Albert was Michael’s name in development), but they were incorrect in stating one character and that he will not die (for as we know it is possible he can). Multiplayer lobbies only held 16, and there was no underworld economy.

# April 10, 2012 – Rockstar Employee’s CV Leaks October 2012 as Release Date

Character animation developer for Rockstar, Alex O’Dwyer, mentions on his CV that he had worked on ""*Grand Theft Auto V""*, and that it is expected to release during October 2012, as viewable [here](https://imgur.com/a/VbB1r3A). Since this was spotted, it has since been removed, with no comment from O’Dwyer or Rockstar. What is interesting, is that if this is also a legitimate leak, it would have also confirmed a PC version of the game.

**Outcome?** *Confirmed*. While the launch dates did end up being incorrect, the mention of the PC version and taking into consideration that he did work on the game, I believe that it is possible that October 2012 was a launch goal internally at Rockstar – at least at one point.

# May 15, 2012 – ""GTAV"" Vehicle List Found in ""Max Payne 3""

A user on [GTAForums](https://gtaforums.com/topic/510202-gta-v-vehicleside-lines-found-in-mp3-files/) had allegedly found the vehicle list for ""*Grand Theft Auto V""* within the game files of ""*Max Payne 3*"", outlining the types of trains, cars, boats, helicopters, and bikes that players would be able to use. Vehicles of note included a cable car, a chair lift, a ski-mobile, and an APC. If memory serves me correctly, these are some of the vehicles mentioned that did not make it into the final game, while on the other hand there are dozens of vehicles that are not mentioned here that are in the game.

**Outcome?** *Fake.*

# September 9, 2012 – Our First Gameplay Leak?

A popular video that I personally remember doing the rounds before the game’s release was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiFyFrAmW1w) video here, which shows a car being driven through the incredibly detailed desert, before getting into a helicopter. The map shows an incredibly detailed mountain range, and a desert populated with scenery. It definitely seems like something that would be in the style of the *""GTA""* series, and one I somewhat believed when I first saw it.

**Outcome?** *Fake*. As it turns out, this was just a fan-made video, that has gone over multiple name changes throughout the years – I believe a comment mentioned that this title had once been renamed to suggest it was a ""*GTAVI*"" leak.  

# October 28, 2012 – Polish Site Leaks “GTAV” Promotion Material and Release Date

The promotional material and release date had seemingly been made public – not through Rockstar but a Polish site (a site from Poland…not that stuff you shine stuff with). The posters include Franklin and his dog (at the time I believe he wasn’t revealed), as well as characters preparing to rob the jewellery store (revealed days earlier, per [Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/this-grand-theft-auto-v-artwork-promises-pest-control-5954524)). The tagline on the posters suggest that the game is available in Spring 2013 – (March, April, May for us southern hemisphere-ers), which at the time seemed likely as it was pretty clear the game was not coming out in 2012. It is also interesting that “*Red Dead: Redemption*” was also released in Spring of 2010 – so it isn’t entirely unfeasible to suggest the same for “*GTAV*”. 

**Outcome?** *Confirmed*. I believe this is a genuine leak, the artwork is too legitimate, as well as the release date being able to be confirmed by the following…  

# October 30, 2012 – Rockstar Announce Spring 2013 Release Date

[Rockstar Games](https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/45951/grand-theft-auto-v-is-coming-spring-2013.html) are “proud to announce that Grand Theft Auto V is expected to launch worldwide spring 2013 for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3”.   

# January 31, 2013 – Rockstar Announce September 17, 2013 Release Date

[Well that was quick.](http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/48591/grand-theft-auto-v-is-coming-9172013.html)  

# August 23, 2013 – “GTAV” files discovered on Playstation Store

As [Venture Beat](https://venturebeat.com/2013/08/25/sony-apologizes-as-gta-v-assets-leak-online/) reports, users who had preordered “*GTAV*” on the European version of the PlayStation Store were able to download some files as they had become available on the 22nd of August. Users mined these details, being able to discover the [game's soundtrack (here is a reddit thread about it)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1kyndb/complete_gta_v_soundtrack_leaked_list_of_songs/), while the game’s main theme was leaked as well - video of such has since been deleted. Due to the nature of the files, the leaks were primarily audio files, and did not leak to any actual gameplay leaks. 

A day later, Playstation [provided a comment](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/08/24/grand-theft-auto-v-update/) on the matter, saying;  
 

>Regrettably, some people who downloaded the digital pre-order of Grand Theft Auto V through the PlayStation Store in Europe were able to access certain GTA V assets. These assets were posted online. We have since removed the digital pre-order file from the PlayStation Store in Europe. We sincerely apologize to Rockstar and GTA fans across the world who were exposed to the spoiler content. GTA V is one of the most highly anticipated games of the year with a very passionate following, and we’re looking forward to a historic launch on September 17.

**Outcome?** *Confirmed.*      

# September 10, 2013 – Strategy Guide Leaks Map 

The world were able to discover just how big the game was when the map for the game was [taken](https://imgur.com/a/Ikqfhb0) from the game’s official strategy guide. The map was posted onto reddit for all to see [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/1m3h8b/mustresistdontwanttospoil/), and many were impressed – one user liking the map to a “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle”. The guide was originally meant to release with the game’s release on the 17th of September, but it seems once retailers received their copies they were able to scan and share some of the information. 

**Outcome?** *Confirmed.*  

&#x200B;

# September 17, 2013 - Grand Theft Auto V Released

#   

# September 22, 2013 – Micro-transactions Discovered

Reddit user u/1880 seemed to discover why it was so hard for players to earn cash in the game and [discovered a file](https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/1mx8a6/so_i_might_have_found_why_its_so_hard_to_make/) that references “cash cards”, ranging from $100,000 to $1,250,000. A copy of the file was uploaded [here](https://pastebin.com/raw/S0Maeh28). However, these ""cash cards"" were unable to be accessed – despite the game being playable. The original post is quite hopeful that it is just something that was scrapped in development as it “seems very un-Rockstar-y” to the poster.  

Unfortunately, reddit user u/Nouveau_Compte was able to provide proof that it was only for online, shared on the same thread. 

**Outcome?** *A sad confirmation.*   


# Closing Thoughts & Some Housekeeping

  
That was a big read, featuring a good mix or confirmed and fake leaks - hopefully giving you the hint to stay vigilant as rumours start to increase in frequency for *Grand Theft Auto VI*. Having said that, you'll never know what you read that does turn out to be true.  Here are a couple other links that you might also find interesting, but didn't include in the post;

 [GTA V Location Teased in GTAIV Manual](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vice-city-linked-to-grand-theft-auto-v-teaser/1100-6239776/) 

 [New Casting Call for GTAV](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-v-linked-to-new-casting-call/1100-6306283/) 

It seems Rockstar games seem to have a high number of rumours, leaks, and just plain lies, given their reputation and the popularity of their games. I can also tell you, the next GTA game that I am working on a post for, already has more sources and ""leaks"" than I found for GTAV...but this post won't be ready any time soon. 

Some other housekeeping notes, I just want to find out a few things;  


* Are you liking the long posts, or would you rather them split up over a Part 1, Part 2 type thing?
* Would you like to see some games revisited, such as Destiny, and cover the post-launch leaks?
* What games do you want to see?

Other things, these posts might start slowing down - but fear not! They are still being worked on, got a few more in the pipeline. I am also going to limit these posts to games that have only been released. For those who are asking, the idea of a video format is also being explored.  

Here are some previous editions of this series;  


*  [Fallout 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/gm7yla/fallout_4_a_look_back_at_the_major_leaks/)
*  [Destiny](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/gj32y9/destiny_a_look_back_at_the_major_leaks/)
*  [Assassin's Creed: Valhalla](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/gdjw1w/a_retroactive_look_at_the_leaks_behind_assassins/)   
*  [Red Dead Redemption 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/gfdao0/red_dead_redemption_2_a_look_back_at_the_major/) 

Thanks for reading, appreciate any and all feedback.

## Telegraph - 5/5

[Review](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/dark-souls-3-review/)

Author: Sayem Ahmed 

>But with its unrelenting dedication to an artistic vision that’s reflected through gameplay mechanics, difficulty and visual design, Dark Souls 3’s approach should be applauded, despite any shortcomings. It is one of the most fascinating games you’ll play this year, or any other, a high-profile game that still dares to go against the grain despite its ever growing popularity.

## IGN - 9.5/10

[Review](http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review)

Author: Chloi Rad 

>If Dark Souls 3 truly is the last in the series as we know it, then it’s a worthy send-off. Weapon arts allow stylish and versatile new moves without tarnishing the purity of the combat system. Lothric’s awe-inspiring locations provide visually stunning arenas for rigorous exploration and fierce face-offs with hosts of deadly enemies and even deadlier bosses. While not all the risky changes land as neatly as others, Dark Souls 3 is a powerful journey and the sequel the series truly deserves.

##PCGamer - 94/100

[Review](http://www.pcgamer.com/dark-souls-3-review/)

Author: James Davenport

>I’m surprised he did at all. The added fidelity in Dark Souls 3 could have just been a simple upgrade in texture detail, but FromSoftware treats the extra space like a wider canvas, pushing their themes and story through every possible avenue—sound, music, enemy design, animation, dialogue, item descriptions, environmental cues—with more finesse and frequency than ever before. Dark Souls 3 gracefully pushes the series’ notoriously difficult action towards a greater artfulness that tests far more than reflexes. I was challenged to read environments and props like a novel, to empathize with Lothric’s imperfect inhabitants, and to ask whether or not I was trying to save anything worth saving. But there are no easy answers here, only 40-plus hours of tense action, awe-inspiring exploration, certain death, and big, bleak, beautiful questions. 

## Game Informer - 9.3/10

[Review](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dark_souls_iii/b/playstation4/archive/2016/04/04/familiar-but-fascinating-fantasy.aspx)

Author: Daniel Tack 

>Dark Souls III successfully replicates the winning formula of the Souls series, a wondrous combination of majestic boss battles, incredible layered environments full of secrets, and precise combat that can make other action RPGs difficult to play once you’ve mastered the art. If you’ve never played the series, this is a great place to begin, offering a bit more direction in the early game before opening up. If you’ve already played the series, you can feel confident that From Software hasn’t lost its touch.

## WCCFTech - 9.2/10

[Review](http://wccftech.com/review/dark-souls-iii-review/)

Author: Dave Aubrey

>My journey through Lothric to meet with the Lords of Cinder took me through unforgettable vistas and resulted in more than a few sleepless nights where all I could think about was pushing through another corridor, seeking out another bonfire. It’s an experience that the established Souls fans already know they can’t miss, while for those curious about Dark Souls, eager to discover what all the hype is about, this is the perfect starting point.

>It might not be everyone’s favorite Souls game, but it just might be mine and I can guarantee that Dark Souls III will dominate more than a few Game of the Year lists in 2016.

## HardcoreGamer - 4.5/5

[Review](http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/04/04/review-dark-souls-iii/200825/)

Author: Adam Beck

>Dark Souls III is shorter than what we’ve come to expect, but it’s also more consolidated to give players exactly what they’re looking for without any unnecessary fluff. There’s still some mishandled bonfire locations and shortcuts spread throughout the world, but this is still a major step-up in level designs and boss battles. It will bring nostalgia back to a game that isn’t even five years old yet, moving through a world that feels oddly familiar, yet at the same time new and refreshing. For those who haven’t been able to get into Dark Souls in the past, your mind won’t be swayed here as the third installment is mechanically the same with only slight alterations to combat and progression. Fortunately those already tightly entrenched in the series won’t have anything to scoff at. Significantly improved over its predecessor, Dark Souls III will have players immersed in the deep and rich fiction that From Software is known for.

Author: Jim Sterling 

>Any player who’s been through this mill is prepared to die, but once more, that fantastic beacon of hope urging players to press forward and overcome each obstacle is shining as bright as ever. Because that’s what Dark Souls is all about – perishing, persevering, and prevailing.

>No game series comes close to doing what Dark Souls does, and Dark Souls III has done it again.

>It’s an undead favorite.

## PlayStation LifeStyle - 8.5/10

[Review](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review-fire-ps4/#/slide/1)

Author: Paulmichael Contreras 

>Dark Souls III is another punishingly hard game in an era of hand-holding that masochists will appreciate. While enemy AI is laughably dumb, those same enemies can take you down in no time flat. This is a game that forces you to learn its intricacies and quirks, and use them all to your advantage. Sporting a wonderful environment full of color, suffering, death, and a small amount of hope, fans can expect to sink several dozen, if not hundreds, of hours into the game, if they haven’t already. From Software knows how to make challenging games that reward those who invest the time needed to properly engage enemies, and Dark Souls III continues in that tradition.

## Destructoid - 8.5/10

[Review](http://www.destructoid.com/review-dark-souls-iii-350397.phtml)

Author: Chris Carter 

>If Dark Souls III truly is the last game for now, it makes perfect sense, since it's just as much of a love letter to fans as it is a culmination of the series. I may not have like this iteration as much as the rest, but it's still streets ahead of most current action games and deserves a warm spot on your shelf by the bonfire.


## GameSpot - 8/10

[Review](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-souls-3-review/1900-6416397/)

Author: Mike Mahardy 

>There are several possible endings to Dark Souls III, and although most are anticlimactic, they drive home the loneliness of the paths we took. The old lords have abandoned their posts, and in the hunt to usurp them, we descend into those dark valleys, and climb those imposing peaks. This is the essence of Dark Souls III: periods of doubt, followed by great reward. The journey may be rocky, but there's a throne waiting at the end.

## Attack of the Fanboy - 4/5

[Review](http://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/dark-souls-3-review/)

Author: Kyle Hanson

>A grand, epic, sweeping, and extremely lengthy adventure awaits players in Dark Souls 3. The switch to current gen consoles has allowed the game to flourish, with the best visuals ever for the series. This comes at a bit of a cost, sadly, as performance can be sluggish on rare occasions. The gameplay is still pure Dark Souls bliss though, and if you enjoyed it in the past, you will eat up every single hour of this game. For those looking to get into the series, this one is a good place to start, as it does a better job of funneling players along the proper path. It is still an open world though, and getting lost is not only inevitable, but also part of the fun. While everything you loved is back, some problems also return, such as a not-so-great targeting system and other missing features. Those seeking something wholly new will be disappointed, but if you want more of the Dark Souls gameplay that you love, this is exactly what you’ve been asking for.

Author: Philip Kollar 

>At this point, most Souls players know what they're looking for in a new entry. Your personal expectations for the series will play a key part in your enjoyment of Dark Souls 3. If you play these games for the intense, controller-clenching combat and the excitement of invading other players' worlds, then there's a lot here to keep you busy and happy. But in so many important ways — its world design, its pacing, the technology powering it — Dark Souls 3 falls short of the mark. Do you play for the joy and stress of exploring dangerous, intricately crafted places full of hidden elements and endless side paths? Then I suspect you'll join me in being a little let down with the direction this sequel has gone in.

## Eurogamer - Essential

[Review](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-04-dark-souls-3-review)

Author: Rich Stanton

>This is a truly epic journey, from your first faltering steps across gloomy cliffs to striding like a lord-slayer through Lothric Castle. Like all epics it has endless diversions, quarrels, unexpected companions, and great big fights. Is it the finest Souls game yet? I don't know; it might be. I can say this, though: Dark Souls 3 is a fabulous game, and a fitting conclusion to the greatest trilogy of modern times.

## Rock Paper Shotgun - No Score

[Review](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/04/04/dark-souls-iii-review-pc/)

Author: Adam Smith

>My complaints are minor, given the quality of the game as a whole, and some of them are directed toward elements that make this entry more approachable than its predecessors.

>An experience where you begin to question if such a traversal move is possible, can it be done &#x2013; is that really the way forward? The answer is almost always yes, and in this regard the sheer speed, fluidity, and scope of Ori's fundamental movement &#x2013; that is moving the analogue stick so the glow-y spirit thing can do its thing &#x2013; is phenomenal.

Even when the NPCs of the world don't really make a big impact and the game suffered from some bugs and loading issues before Day One, every Xbox One/PC owner should definitely get this game.

>So far, Ori and the Will of the Wisps has taken my breath away. It's possibly one of the most aesthetically gorgeous games I've ever played, even if some parts do feel like they've been ripped straight from the first game and the soundtrack is masterful in every sense of the word.

>With the need to go bigger, Ori and the Will of the Wisps loses some of the simplicity and innocence of the original game, but it steps up in turn with bite and refinement. It's the perfect companion to Ori and the Blind Forest, and is an early defining moment of the decade to come.

It refines The Blind Forest's mechanics, expands on the world, and throws in a whole bunch of new moves and concepts. But in an era that's rich with ""emotional platformers,"" Will of the Wisps doesn't do anything to make itself stand out. It's a fine, if not forgettable, experience.

>Ori and the Will of the Wisps is the worthy sequel of one of the best games ever published on Xbox One: a stellar return by Moon Studios, one that confirms the talent of a very unique software house. Too bad for some technical flaws and for a code that appears to be a lot less polished than expected: even as it is Will of the Wisps remains a game that's impossible to miss, stating once again the importance and the diversity of this franchise inside the Xbox galaxy.

>Ori and the Will of the Wisps marks a thrilling return to the unique, gorgeous world created by its predecessor. In many ways it is more of the same, but only in the best ways possible, as Will of the Wisps succeeds in retaining all of the high points of Ori and the Blind Forest, while making great improvements and updates across the board. It’s an emotional journey with a lovely story about friendship and family that looks incredible, sounds lovely, and feels really great to play. Sequels have the unenviable task of being both the full embodiment of and improvement over their progenitors, and Will of the Wisps absolutely delivers on this difficult task. It’s every bit the follow-up you would want to see, and it stands in its own right as an excellent game.

It's a modern fairy tale with a lesson that should be accepted by everyone and applied without reservation in the everyday life. So be careful: playing Ori and the Will of the Wisps could make you a better person.

>Ori and the Will of the Wisps builds on its predecessor's near-perfect Metroidvania platforming and grows the concept to wonderful effect. A game that's as much about rebirth, hope and wonder as it is death and decay, Will of the Wisps is a beautiful, enchanting piece of fantasy, and an instant classic.

>Fans of the first game, as well as platformer and metroidvania fans in general need to give Ori and the Will of the Wisps their time. As long as the performance issues are completely ironed out in the near future, this is one platformer that’ll long be remembered.

>Ori and the Will of the Wisps triumphs despite some rough edges, with what might be the most satisfying and evocative platformer ever made.

-------------

**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [9 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2020/3/10/reviews/118454/)

>Ori and the Will of the Wisps is bigger and more polished than the original title. I can't recommend playing it before the original, if only because the plot relies on you having played the first game. Otherwise, this is an absolute must-play for fans of the genre. Some minor quibbles and a few annoying bugs hold it back, but hopefully, those will be addressed by the day-one patch. If you've been waiting for Will of the Wisps, you'll be extremely pleased.

>Backed by an amazing art style, a great soundtrack and a selection of heartwarming characters to take you through the story, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is pure platforming perfection.

But I still have a ways to go before completing it. Maybe the plot will win me over. Maybe the world will do something surprising and evoke something besides Mad Max. But even if it doesn’t, I still like Rage 2. Artistically, it’s uninspired. But mechanically, it’s one of the best shooters I’ve played in years. Fun wins out.*|PC|
|[**PowerUp!**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/577/powerup-) **-** [Leo Stevenson](https://opencritic.com/critic/3173/leo-stevenson)|Review-In-Progress \~ [Review-In-Progress](https://powerup-gaming.com/2019/05/13/rage-2-review/)|*So far, I am really enjoying Rage 2 yet something just doesn't sit right*|PS4|
|[**ACG**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg) \- [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter)|Buy \~ [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVdjRj94o_Y)|*I would, say on the PC, this is worthy of a purchase right now. There is some performance issues, absolutely, but I have to say the combat is phenomenal. It feels excellent, I like the weapons, there is a bevy of upgrades, and multiple difficulties you can choose. If you mainline this thing, it's not the longest game. But if you want to continue to play on, you can do that and the fiction slightly matches that or do most of that content prior to going to the end, you can do either one. There are some weaknesses here, I hope to see some patches, but this was a blast to play, despite any other issues I ended up having, and I did have some, there was never a time where I really sat back and said ""I'm not enjoying myself"", which I can't say for a lot of other games.*|PC|
|[**MMoinGame**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/695/mmoingame) \- [Kharzak](https://www.mmoingame.com/author/karzhak/) \- *Spanish*|94 \~ [9.4 / 10](https://www.mmoingame.com/reviews/analisis-review-rage-2/)|*If Doom and Mad Max had been lying in the same bed, the result would have been called RAGE 2.*|PC|
|[**USgamer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/66/usgamer) \- [Mike Williams](https://opencritic.com/critic/299/mike-williams)|80 \~ [4 / 5 stars](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/rage-2-review)|*In Rage 2, you move fast and kill faster. It's the synthesis between id Software's 2016 reboot of Doom and Avalanche Studios' Mad Max, bringing together some of the best ideas from both. Moment-to-moment play on foot is fantastic with each weapon and ability just opening up your options for destruction. Driving could be improved and it's a little on the shorter side, but Rage 2 is a damned good time.*|PC|
|[**Destructoid**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/90/destructoid) \- [Chris Carter](https://opencritic.com/critic/431/chris-carter)|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-rage-2-552045.phtml)|*I was pleasantly surprised with the shooter chimera that is Rage 2, which ended up being open world mini-Doom 2016. It's not going to make anyone a believer in shooters or the free roam format, but folks already predisposed to those vices will find plenty to sink their teeth into.*|PC|
|[**The Games Machine**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/497/the-games-machine) \- [Simone Rampazzi](https://opencritic.com/critic/5475/simone-rampazzi) \- *Italian*|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/rage-2/rage-2-recensione/)|*The collaboration between id Software and Avalanche Studios brought us a nice open-world first person shooter, despite a bunch of issues with the world building and a shallow plot.*|PC|
|[**IGN**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign) \- [Dan Stapleton](https://opencritic.com/critic/201/dan-stapleton)|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/13/rage-2-review)|*With its large open world and vast array of upgrades to earn,* *Rage 2* *feels very much like an antidote for Far Cry fans who have overdosed on that particular style and want a new take on the large-scale shooter-RPG idea. Though Avalanche hasn’t quite figured out what makes a world feel alive and dynamic or how to make good use of its vehicles, it absolutely nails the moment-to-moment combat thanks to a Doom-inspired energetic pace that few shooters manage to pull off. Combined with a steady stream of great weapons, abilities, and upgrades, its firefights are constantly reinvigorated even as mission objectives become repetitive.*|PC|
|[**IGN Spain**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/471/ign-spain) \- [David Soriano](https://opencritic.com/critic/3431/david-soriano) \- *Spanish*|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://es.ign.com/rage-2-pc/149507/review/analisis-de-rage-2-para-ps4-xbox-one-y-pc)|*Rage 2 excels as FPS for its agile gunplay mixed with killer skills. It is a pity that the open world, despite the effort to present different biomes, has so little to offer.*|PC|
|[**Hobby Consolas**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas) \- [Álvaro Alonso](https://opencritic.com/critic/3755/-lvaro-alonso) \- *Spanish*|77 \~ [77 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-rage-2-ps4-xbox-one-pc-420147)|*If you're looking for something to blow things up, using super powers and crazy weapons, then you're going to love Rage 2. Just don't look any further, because there's nothing more to see.*|PC|
|[**IGN Italy**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/477/ign-italy) \- [Francesco Destri](https://opencritic.com/critic/3495/francesco-destri) \- *Italian*|77 \~ [7.7 / 10](https://it.ign.com/rage-2-pc/154436/review/rage-2-la-recensione)|*Rage 2 is a pleasure to play if you like to shoot and destroy things, but don't ask for much more in terms of gameplay ... you would be disappointed*|PC|
|[**Everyeye.it**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it) \- [Francesco Fossetti](https://opencritic.com/critic/2988/francesco-fossetti) \- *Italian*|77 *\~* [7.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-rage-2-nuovo-shooter-avalanche-id-software-43772.html?cactus=thejackal)|*Perhaps the most painful aspect concerns the structure of the campaign. The main missions are interspersed with phases of pure ""grinding"" in which it is necessary to increase the level of the three allied ""factions"". If the number of hours needed to complete the story had already seemed low, you should know that the main quest is actually composed of a really unjustifiable number of missions (you don't get to a dozen).*|PC|
|[**Worth Playing**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing) \- [Cody Medellin](https://opencritic.com/critic/4182/cody-medellin)|75 \~ [7.5 / 10](http://worthplaying.com/article/2019/5/13/reviews/114266/)|*Rage 2 is an engaging game that's hindered by a number of annoyances.*||
|[**GameSpace**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/464/gamespace) \- [Jatobi](https://www.gamespace.com/author/jatobi/)|75 \~ [7.5 / 10](https://www.gamespace.com/reviews/rage-2-review-welcome-wasteland/)|*Rage 2 is a great game for the right reasons.  If you're looking for a game with a phenomenal story, you're in the wrong place. The story is boring to me, and rather short at 13 hours of leisurely gameplay. At the very least it doesn't drop off the planet like Rage did.  Gameplay is fun, and vehicle combat works well, giving you an open world Mad Max-esque experience that is simply enjoyable and hard to put down.*|PS4|
|[**PlayStation Universe**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe) \- [Timothy Nunes](https://opencritic.com/critic/846/timothy-nunes)|75 \~ [7.5 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/rage-2-review-ps4/)|*Rage 2 has room to grow, but it's also a great game to pick up and play. Combat is visceral in all the right ways, and exploration is always rewarding. A few technical issues and a general sense of sameness keep it from pure excellence, but Rage 2 still represents a good time.*|PS4|
|[**Game Informer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/35/game-informer) \- [Daniel Tack](https://opencritic.com/critic/1031/daniel-tack)|70 \~ [7 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/rage-2/a-blunted-bloodbath)|*Rage 2 fails to deliver any interesting characters, environments, or activities. Solid shooting and cool weapons lift up the other elements of this title*|PC|
|[**PCGamesN**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/169/pcgamesn) \- [Harry Shepherd](https://opencritic.com/critic/3338/harry-shepherd)|70 \~ [7 / 10](https://www.pcgamesn.com/rage-2/pc-review)|*The pace of id and Avalanche's FPS is neutered by a dull open world and thin story but, in an unbridled whirlwind of gruesome gibs, you probably won't care.*|PC|
|[**Attack of the Fanboy**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/116/attack-of-the-fanboy) \- [William Schwartz](https://opencritic.com/critic/596/william-schwartz)|70 \~ [3.5 / 5 stars](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/rage-2-review/)|*As a shooter Rage 2 is incredible.  It's everything around that core competency that brings the game down.  A lack of narrative, world building, and questionable design decisions in terms of progression leave the experience feeling flat.*|XB1|
|[**PC Gamer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/162/pc-gamer) \- [Andy Kelly](https://opencritic.com/critic/137/andy-kelly)|70 \~ [70 / 100](https://www.pcgamer.com/rage-2-review/)|*Some of the best first-person shooting on PC, but the rest of the game struggles to keep up with it.*|PC|
|[**GameSpot**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot) \- [Michael Higham](https://opencritic.com/critic/3617/michael-higham)|60 \~ [6 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rage-2-review-walker-wasteland-ranger/1900-6417138/)|*The wild, exceptional combat of Rage 2 contends with some of the genre's greats, but it's disappointing that the game's world squanders its potential.*|PC|
|[**GamesRadar+**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-) \- [Ford James](https://opencritic.com/critic/2925/ford-james)|60 \~ [3 / 5 stars](https://www.gamesradar.com/rage-2-review/)|*Rage 2 has a fun core gameplay loop, but everything around it falls flat on its face*||
|[**Slant Magazine**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/318/slant-magazine) \- [Justin Clark](https://opencritic.com/critic/1331/justin-clark)|60 \~ [3 /  5 stars](https://www.slantmagazine.com/games/review-rage-2-brings-the-flair-but-it-barely-fills-its-open-world/)|*It’s a game that works wonders in small, appreciable bursts of neon violence, engaging enough to see its comparatively brief story through to its conclusion. When it’s all over, however, it’s hard not to be disappointed in how little use the Wasteland has for you when you’re not dealing in lead.*|PS4|
|[**Shacknews**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/62/shacknews) \- [Josh Hawkins](https://opencritic.com/critic/279/josh-hawkins)|50 \~ [5 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/111682/rage-2-review-do-not-resuscitate)|*For now, Rage 2 feels like the final shrill beep on the ECG before the flatline hits. The last flutter of life the series had to offer, squandered away.*||

>Respawn has successfully entered the battle royale genre with Apex Legends, allowing itself to take notes from its predecessors and come in and build upon the foundation laid before them. By refining the formula rather than making a significant effort to reinvent the battle royale wheel, this studio has proven themselves as unmistakable masters of their craft with both the Titanfall series and now Apex.

>The battle royale genre has become a crowded field, with many developers and publishers attempting to cut their own piece of the pie since PUBG and Fortnite skyrocketed the genre. Now, Respawn Entertainment decided to throw their hat into the arena with their own game that was leaked and released in under a week, Apex Legends. As a free-to-play game, Respawn Entertainment has successfully created an incredible game using the formula.

**3DNews** - Алексей Лихачев - *Russian* - [8 / 10.0](https://3dnews.ru/976177)

>An exciting adventure full of surprises, secrets and interesting stories. Another successful experiment from Ubisoft.

**AngryCentaurGaming** - Jeremy Penter - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjY9s3UsFUg)

--------------

**Areajugones** - David Cruz García - *Spanish* - [9.4 / 10.0](https://areajugones.sport.es/assassins-creed-odyssey/analisis/)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey is the culmination of a franchise that still knows how to stand its own ground. The RPG options have been expanded and the open world is even deeper. The title set in Greece is a very serious candidate for the GOTY award.

--------------

**Attack of the Fanboy** - William Schwartz - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey gives the very best modern open-world RPGs a run for their money when it comes to the sheer amount of content and level of quality found across the board.

--------------

**Cerealkillerz** - Gabriel Bogdan - *German* - [9 / 10.0](https://cerealkillerz.org/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-die-wohl-groesste-spielwiese-der-antike/)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey surprises with probably the best storyline of the series so far that takes you with major decision options and strong protagonists through a well made Ancient Greece. The different story arcs and different endings are well integrated and even the often necessary grind is lightened up through the deep personalities of Kassandra and Alexios. The Game and the series could still use some better balancing for the progression during the game and the fights but besides that Odyssey takes the right steps forward for the series.

--------------

**COGconnected** - Paul Sullivan - [78 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey, for better or worse, feels like a palette swap of Origins.

--------------

**ComiConverse** - Jordan Samuel - [4 / 5 stars](https://comiconverse.com/assassins-creed-odyssey-game-review-24674)

>Without a doubt, the most robust game in series history as Ubisoft Quebec delivers a player driven Spartan adventure.

--------------

**Critical Hit** - Geoffrey Tim - [9.5 / 10.0](https://www.criticalhit.net/review/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/)

>Assassin's Creed's gradual evolution to RPG is complete. While it remains familiar, the deeper combat, dialogue choices and consequences have upended Assassin's Creed's stealthy roots to deliver a sprawling, multi-tiered historical RPG epic. It's the culmination of the series own journey, and only fitting it be called Odyssey.

--------------

**Destructoid** - Brett Makedonski - [9 / 10.0](https://www.destructoid.com/review-assassin-s-creed-odyssey-524254.phtml)

>Alexios is one of the most memorable protagonists in all of Assassin's Creed, even if I never once actually thought of him as an assassin. In a lesser game, he'd probably be forgettable. But Assassin's Creed Odyssey is superb in nearly every aspect. It's the most impressive Assassin's Creed, even though sometimes it feels like it's Assassin's Creed in name only. It's as broad as Atlas' shoulders and as strong as Hercules. This time, Ubisoft hit a real Homer.

--------------

**Digitally Downloaded** - Ginny W. - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2018/10/review-assassins-creed-odyssey-sony.html)

>Like the Iliad, Dionysus, Lysistrata and other great works of art, your feats in Assassin's Creed Odyssey are incredulous in the best way possible, and it's honestly more entertaining for it.

--------------

**DualShockers** - Logan Moore - [9 / 10.0](https://www.dualshockers.com/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-xbox-one-ps4-pc/)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey isn't just one of the best Assassin's Creed games there has ever been, it's one of the most exceptional action RPGs that I've played this console generation. While only a few years ago I was left wondering what this franchise's future would be, now I'm more excited than I have been in quite some time to see where Ubisoft continues to take Assassin's Creed from here.

--------------

**EGM** - Michael Goroff - [8.5 / 10.0](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey lives up to its namesake. By fully investing in becoming an action RPG, Odyssey's characters, combat, story, and scope are beyond anything the series has accomplished so far. Its ambitions might get the better of it sometimes, like in how it divides its story moments or in how the leveling system can get out of hand, but the overall experience is, simply put, epic. Even when the game's pacing hits a speed bump, there are plenty of engaging and rewarding side quests and distractions to keep you busy.

--------------

**Eurogamer** - Tom Phillips - [Recommended](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-10-01-assassins-creed-odyssey-review-a-vast-and-generous-voyage)

>Colossal in size, lavish in scope, Odyssey feels like a series landmark and Ubisoft's biggest ever game.

--------------

**Forbes** - Paul Tassi - [8.5 / 10.0](https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2018/10/01/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-ps4-demi-god-tier/)

>Origins was delightful and Odyssey hits almost all the same notes, so there's a lot to like about it as well. But this series needs a bit of breathing room, and I hope it gets another bit of rest after this.

--------------

**Gadgets 360** - Rishi Alwani - [9 / 10](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-the-best-since-assassins-creed-2-1925064)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey is an enjoyable romp through Ancient Greece. Its changes are both subtle and sweeping and they come together to make one of the best entries in the franchise since Assassin's Creed 2 on the PS3 and Xbox 360.

--------------

**Game Informer** - Joe Juba - [8.3 / 10.0](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/assassins-creed-odyssey/fighting-for-glory)

>Infiltration, combat, and exploration are all fun in the moment. However, the repetitive objectives and lack of crafted moments make the gameplay blur together as the hours pass

--------------

**Game Rant** - Denny Connolly - [4 / 5 stars](https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-odyssey-reviews/)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey pushes the franchise further away from action and into true RPG territory with dialogue options, branching talent trees, and an addicting armor system.

--------------

**Game Revolution** - Michael Leri - [3.5 / 5 stars](https://www.gamerevolution.com/review/437939-assassins-creed-odyssey-review-greek-repeat)

>Although it crafts a wonderful narrative in an awe-inspiring world, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, through its stubbornness and familiarity, sometimes feels like a ""best of"" compilation of its predecessors without being the best of them.

--------------

**Game Volt** - Ahmed Hassan - *Arabic* - [8.8 / 10.0](https://gamevolt.net/2018/10/01/review-assassins-creed-odyssey/)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey for the first time of the series since ages coming with a pleasant experience and It always makes you ready and motivated to know what's going to happen in the next step and the next detour, it's a beautiful game that encourages you to explore and enjoy your time around Greek Islands.

--------------

**GameCrate** - Leo Parrill - [8.5 / 10.0](http://www.gamecrate.com/reviews/review-assassins-creed-odyssey-almost-perfects-formula/20921)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey hits all the notes a sequel should. It's bigger, prettier, the existing mechanics have been improved, and there's plenty more added. It tells an engaging story, with an excellent protagonist (play Kassandra), all in a beautifully realized setting.

--------------

**GameMAG** - xtr - *Russian* - [9 / 10](https://gamemag.ru/reviews/assassins-creed-odyssey)

>Assassin's Creed: Odyssey is the largest and most complex game in the series. In terms of scale, structure and possibilities it can be compared with Skyrim, and it's just wonderful.

--------------

**Gamerheadquarters** - Jason Stettner - [8.8 / 10.0](https://articles.gamerheadquarters.com/assassinscreedodysseyreview.html)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey is an excellent next step for the franchise expanding upon the strong mechanics from Origins.

--------------

**Gamers Heroes** - Blaine Smith - [9 / 10](http://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/)

>You'll struggle to find a more immersive and rewarding setting in which to forge your own odyssey. A detailed environment combining both the realistic and mythical aspects of Ancient Greece, everything comes together to deliver a narrative-driven, open-world RPG that rivals the biggest names in the genre. Put simply, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is the complete package.

--------------

**Gamersky** - 不倒翁蜀黍 - [8 / 10.0](https://www.gamersky.com/review/201810/1106906.shtml)

>Assassin's Creed: Odyssey re-presents the magnificent view of ancient Greece with an amazing scale and unique perspective. It's much marvelous than any of its prequels, and of course, Odyssey is the best one in Assassin's Creed series of all time. However, the harsh level limit greatly restricts my exploration and forces me to improve levels or obtain loots by finishing a large number of repeated side quests, and it makes me feel dizzy, bored and sad.

--------------

**GamesBeat** - Jeff Grubb - [No Verdict](https://venturebeat.com/2018/10/01/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-in-progress-impossibly-dense/)

>Assassin's Creed: Odyssey is dense, detailed, and varied. It is more dense, detailed, and varied than I considered possible for a video game before playing this. It is a stunning accomplishment, and the 500-to-1,000+ people who worked on it should feel proud.
>
>It has its problems. Combat is clunky, the menus are a slog, and leveling feels off. But those issues never made me want to stop playing. I want to keep playing right now.

--------------

**GameSpace** - Sythrael - [9 / 10.0](https://www.gamespace.com/reviews/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/)

>To wrap it all up, I am very much enchanted by this game. It is not without its flaws, for certain, but I didn't find any that broke the game or my appreciation and excitement for it. I feel that the step that Ubisoft Quebec took to make this experience more immersive and personal for gamers was a strong move, and they did it with style and a competence that greatly benefits the game as a whole. If these are the kind of evolutions we have to look forward to in the future, I eagerly await the next releases from them. Until then, go forth and let the drachmae roll in.

--------------

**GameSpot** - Alessandro Fillari - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-wonder-and-glory/1900-6416999/)

>While its large-scale campaign--clocking in at over 50 hours--can occasionally be tiresome, and some features don't quite make the impact they should, Odyssey makes great strides in its massive and dynamic world, and it's a joy to venture out and leave your mark on its ever-changing setting.

--------------

**GamesRadar+** - Sam Loveridge - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/)

>Perfects everything Origins did and enhances them in ways you never thought an Assassin's Creed game could. Odyssey has it all.

--------------

**Gaming Nexus** - Nathan Carter - [9.5 / 10.0](https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/5799/Assassins-Creed-Odyssey/)

>Not since Breath of the Wild have I enjoyed an open world game this much. With so much to see and do, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is one of, it not the best, game in the Assassin's Creed franchise—and absolutely a game of the year contender.

--------------

**GamingBolt** - Shubhankar Parijat - [9 / 10.0](https://gamingbolt.com/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-lets-do-the-odyssey)

>This is one of the best Assassin's Creed games Ubisoft has ever made, joining the likes of Assassin's Creed 2 and Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood at the very top of the franchise's hierarchy. While its choice and consequence mechanics aren't radical reinventions, they add a great deal of agency and variation to the proceedings, while a beautiful and varied setting, a meaningful progression system, a ton of enjoyable content, and the series' best combat system all come together to deliver a memorable odyssey.

--------------

**GearNuke** - Khurram Imtiaz - [9 / 10.0](https://gearnuke.com/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-ps4/)

>The story is undoubtedly the most enjoyable part of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, helped by the choice-driven narrative that delivers a significant impact on how certain key story elements play out in the game. It is all further bolstered by simple action RPG mechanics that are not too complex but still fun to mess around. All things considered, this is clearly the most comprehensive and ambitious Assassin's Creed game to date.

--------------

**God is a Geek** - Nicola Ardron - [8 / 10.0](https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/)

>A huge, ambitious game building on the solid foundations of Origins to deliver a game that feels like another positive step towards a very interesting future for the franchise.

--------------

**Hardcore Gamer** - Chris Shive - [3.5 / 5.0](https://www.hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=313828)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a worthy follow-up to Origins, incorporating new gameplay ideas while following the same formula as its predecessor.

--------------

**Hobby Consolas** - Álvaro Alonso - *Spanish* - [90 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-assassins-creed-odyssey-ps4-xbox-one-pc-308293)

>With Odyssey, Ubisoft has crafted the biggest Assasin's Creed to date. A colossal open world, action RPG, that can go toe to toe with the biggest names in the genre. If you're a fan of this kind of games, don't miss it.

--------------

**IGN** - Brandin Tyrrel - [9.2 / 10.0](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/01/assassins-creed-odyssey-review)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey's open-world adventure through ancient Greece is a gorgeous thrill, and the best the series has ever been.

--------------

**IGN Spain** - David Soriano - *Spanish* - [9 / 10.0](https://es.ign.com/assassins-creed-odyssey-xbox-one/139900/review/analisis-de-assassins-creed-odyssey-para-ps4-xbox-one-y-pc)

>If you liked Origins, you'll love Odyssey even though its novelties do not end up having the importance that they should.

--------------

**Kotaku** - Heather Alexandra - [No Verdict](https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-odyssey-the-kotaku-review-1829425897)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey's defining characteristic is how often it seems to be anything other than an Assassin's Creed game.

--------------

**PlayStation Universe** - John-Paul Jones - [9.5 / 10.0](https://www.psu.com/reviews/ps4-assassins-creed-odyssey/)

>A glorious sum of newly implemented RPG systems, refined traditional series beats and boasting one of the most entertaining stories in recent memory, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is simply the best in the series and one of the finest open-world adventures available.

--------------

**Polygon** - Colin Campbell - [No Verdict](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/10/1/17920288/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-ps4-xbox-one-windows-pc)

>For all its faults, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is one of the best explorable game worlds yet made.

--------------

**PowerUp!** - Leo Stevenson - [9.1 / 10.0](https://powerup-gaming.com/2018/10/01/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-its-all-greek-to-me/)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey is, without doubt, the best this series has ever produced.

--------------

**Press Start** - James Mitchell - [9 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2018/10/01/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-an-absolute-wonder-to-discover/)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey successfully builds upon the already strong foundation that Origins set to provide yet another Assassin's Creed experience that still feels fresh and, more importantly, fun to explore and dive into. Even better, it does all this without the typical bloat you'd expect, although Conquest Battles do feel like a missed opportunity. Despite this minor letdown, Odyssey eclipses Origins in practically every way, and is easily the best Assassin's Creed yet.

--------------

**RPG Site** - Kazuma Hashimoto - [7 / 10](http://www.rpgsite.net/review/7829-assassin-s-creed-odyssey-review)

>Assassin's Creed: Odyssey is a solid attempt to create a new epic, but it also falls foul of similar missteps to its predecessors.

--------------

**SA Gamer** - Garth Holden - [9.5 / 10.0](https://sagamer.co.za/review-assassins-creed-odyssey-ps4)

>Odyssey takes what Origins started and sharpens it to a fine edge. This is bigger, better, bolder and still has time to be intimate and grounded in the middle of a massive war and tale of intrigue.

--------------

**Softpedia** - Silviu Stahie - [9 / 10.0](https://www.softpedia.com/reviews/games/playstation-4/assassin-039-s-creed-odyssey-review-522969.shtml)

>Odyssey builds upon the foundations of a beloved franchise and I like the way it's going forward. If Ubisoft doesn't get too greedy and takes its time to build a proper game, the next one is going to be even better, although I have to say that it's going to be difficult since this one is almost perfect.

--------------

**Stevivor** - Matt Gosper - [9 / 10.0](https://stevivor.com/reviews/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-greece-lightning/)

>I honestly enjoyed my time with Assassin's Creed: Odyssey. It adds new elements to the franchise's recipe that I enjoy, and some of the story beats look to be leading future instalments in a really interesting direction.

--------------

**The Escapist** - Arthur Gies - [6 / 10](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/2018/10/01/review-assassins-creed-odyssey/)

>A progressive Assassin's Creed saddled with signicficant baggage.

--------------

**TheSixthAxis** - Gareth Chadwick - [8 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/01/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey throws so much stuff at you, it's difficult to sift through it all. It's a beautiful game to look at and the story is intriguing, but it feels like a game that could have been a little more ambitious if given more time to develop. There's good ideas, from the branching story and character choice to the return of ship-based combat, but its ambitions also fray around the edges in a way that Origins didn't.

--------------

**Twinfinite** - Zhiqing Wan - [4.5 / 5.0](https://twinfinite.net/2018/10/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/)

>It's strange, because Odyssey barely even feels like an Assassin's Creed game. Take away Layla Hassan and the ""Assassin's Creed"" brand from the title, and I'd just look at this game as a really strong, standalone historical fiction video game.

--------------

**USgamer** - Mike Williams - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/assassins-creed-odyssey-review)

>Building upon the foundation established in Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey brings together that title's RPG adventure with the ship-bound exploration of Black Flag. Choice and consequence feature heavily in Odyssey, with the player guiding Alexios or Kassandra through a massive journey to reunite their family and kill a lot of people. Not every feature is perfect, with things like recruitment and Conquest Battles needing a bit of work, but overall Odyssey is a grand next step for the journey Origins started.

--------------

**VGN** - Tommaso Stio - *Italian* - [9 / 10.0](https://www.vgn.it/recensione/74633/assassins-creed-odyssey-ps4/)

>After 10 years, the Assassin's Creed series keeps developing and becomes a RPG with lots of mission chapters, objects to unlock and characters to discover.
>Be ready for a turn of events, a system entirely calibrated on the single player experience and of course an exemplary gaming world. Looking back, we all know how some chapters have been increasingly amazing; it is hard not to consider this one as the best episode of the entire series. This is probably the best Assasin's Creed ever created, although most traditional aspects of its brand have now disappeared.

--------------

**VGProfessional** - Nazih Fares, Mazen Abdallah - [9 / 10.0](https://www.vgprofessional.com/videogames/review-assassins-creed-odyssey/)

>With a new world to discover, Assassin's Creed Odyssey continues on the path set by Origins, giving more choice to the players, with a bigger focus on RPG and the comeback of naval warfare. A definitive evolution of the series, and shouldn't be missed.

--------------

**VideoGamer** - Michael Harradence - [8 / 10](http://www.videogamer.com//reviews/assassins-creed-odyssey-review)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey sees the franchise at its strongest and most ambitious yet. With a compelling story, solid RPG mechanics, and heaps of content to soak up, you'll be spending months immersed in its sprawling Greek sandbox.

--------------

**We Got This Covered** - Jon Hueber - [5 / 5 stars](https://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/)

>Assassin's Creed Odyssey is an epic, historical RPG that uses elements of Assassin's Creed to tell a different kind of origin story, and the results are stunning in almost every way.

--------------

**WellPlayed** - Edward Darling - [9 / 10.0](https://www.well-played.com.au/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/)

>Assassin’s Creed’s shift to Ancient Greece also includes a more personal experience, action on the high seas and even deeper mysteries

--------------

**Windows Central** - Jez Corden - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.windowscentral.com/assassins-creed-odyssey-review)

>If you enjoyed Assassin's Creed IV's naval combat and Assassin Creed Origins' shift to an RPG-like progression system, Odyssey is a match made in Elysium. Odyssey does not revolutionize the franchise, but it's a capable entry that will satisfy fans for dozens and dozens of hours.

--------------

**Worth Playing** - Redmond Carolipio - [8.8 / 10.0](http://worthplaying.com/article/2018/10/1/reviews/111079/)

>With that said, after dozens of hours, I still have yet to really scratch the surface of the true Odyssey narrative because as I mentioned before, there are multiple story arcs to follow. One concerns Kassandra and her true family roots, another involves a massive conspiratorial web that spans all of Greece, and yet another involves the greater picture of the pieces of Eden and the Assassins' mission. Windows into each of those arcs are found throughout the map — within the missions and into the cinema scenes and dialogues. This is the kind of game where you could wipe out days of time paying attention to one piece of the greater story, with the true joy coming when you get to take a step back and see the story you've built.

>A case of refinement rather than dramatic change, Assassin's Creed Odyssey nonetheless injects even more depth and detail into the series, with dialogue choices and the ensuing consequences that follow proving a worthwhile addition. If you enjoyed Origins, Assassin's Creed Odyssey will scratch the same itch, and then some. A sensational sequel that's thankfully not a Greek tragedy.

**Zoomg** - Meysam Khalilzadeh - *Persian* - [8.5 / 10.0](https://www.zoomg.ir/2018/10/1/297046/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/)

>New features like dialogue system and additions to the gameplay have made Assassin's Creed Odyssey a better and greater experience compared to Origins. Odyssey also has a great story with different endings and complete collection of mythical creatures or enemy types. in the end, Odyssey may have some bugs or camera problems, but it is surely one of the greatest Assassin's Creed ever.

It’s Bloodborne but faster, with fewer crutches yet somehow more fair. It’s also one of the best games released so far in what’s already looking like a strong 2019.*|PS4|
|[**Polygon**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/87/polygon) \- [Dave Tach](https://opencritic.com/critic/1501/dave-tach)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/3/21/18274733/sekiro-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc)|*I have to put in a lot of work and effort to meet Sekiro on its own terms, but what might feel ponderous in a lesser game becomes rewarding in one created with this much care. Sekiro meets me with just as much effort and enthusiasm as I’ve put into it. It lets me know I’m capable and skilled, and that I can figure it out.*|PS4|
|[**Mysca**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxr3wUlAVGva2Bul8AkAolw) \- [Mysca](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxr3wUlAVGva2Bul8AkAolw)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkeAa-pYk_o)|*Combat complexity applies difficulty, not the other way around. This game understands that, applies that and masters it to a new level I’ve not seen reached before.*|PS4|
|[**Kotaku**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/276/kotaku) \- [Natalie Degraffinried](https://opencritic.com/critic/6083/natalie-degraffinried)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://kotaku.com/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-the-kotaku-review-1833579694)|*Ultimately, the question I had coming in was, “Will this be worth it?” After moving through countless cycles of life and death, tensing, raging, and finally, conquering my challenges and letting go of my anger like Buddha, I decided that it was.* |PS4|

|[**Daily Star**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/686/daily-star) \- [Rebecca Stow](https://opencritic.com/critic/4972/rebecca-stow)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/reviews/766807/Sekiro-Shadow-s-Die-Twice-Review-FromSoftware-adventure-is-a-game-to-die-twice-for)|*While Sekiro certainly shares DNA with the previous Soulsborne games, fundamental sword-fighting battle mechanic changes leave it feeling fresh. However, as the old saying goes, when you live by the sword, you die by the sword, and players need to be aware that this is a game that will see you die many, many times.*|PS4|
|[**Saudi Gamer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/455/saudi-gamer) \- [Saleh Bazarah](https://opencritic.com/critic/3302/-) \- *Arabic*|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://saudigamer.com/review/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/)|Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a welcome change for the developer solidifying FromSoftware's skills and expertise in tackling bigger challenges and improving on past successes. A superb effort all around; whether it's the intricate combat system, the world and how you explore it, or the relentless challenge by the world and its bosses, this is an epic journey that never lets go of you. If you're looking for a challenging game with blisteringly fast action that you'll have to work hard to conquer then Don't Think Twice.||
|[**Fandom**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/580/fandom) \- [Jordan Oloman](https://opencritic.com/critic/2320/jordan-oloman)|100 \~ [5 / 5](https://www.fandom.com/articles/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review)|*Sekiro is an electrifying power trip that demands a lot from the player, but if you let it grip you it will be hard to pull its rickety wooden hand from your wrist. Every time I put words to paper I’m emboldened once more to head back in there. I’m inspired and terrified thinking about the friends I’ve made, bereft with Rot Essence, praying for me to surpass the next fork in the road so I can bring them back to life.*|XB1|
|[**Windows Central**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/515/windows-central) \- [Asher Madan](https://opencritic.com/critic/4654/asher-madan)|100 \~ [5 /  5 stars](https://www.windowscentral.com/sekiro-xbox-one-review)|*It's definitely harder than Dark Souls, but the sense of satisfaction you feel after defeating powerful titans is a reward in itself. The more you play, the stronger you become. The story and gameplay take you in new directions, but Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice's difficulty may limit its appeal. Unlike previous FromSoftware games, it lacks multiplayer so you can't summon allies to help you.* |XB1|
|[**Telegraph**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/28/telegraph) \- [Tom Hoggins](https://opencritic.com/critic/1367/tom-hoggins)|100 \~ [5 /  5 stars](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review-thrilling-ferocious-ninja-adventure/)|*A thrilling, ferocious ninja adventure that puts modern video game convention to the sword*||
|[**PowerUp!**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/577/powerup-) \- [Leo Stevenson](https://opencritic.com/critic/3173/leo-stevenson)|99 \~ [9.9 / 10](https://powerup-gaming.com/2019/03/22/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review-a-brand-new-beast/)|*Mechanically, it’s simply one of the best, most playable and most rewarding video games to be released this, or any other generation. The level at which From Software is operating in crafting Sekiro Shadows Die Twice is absolutely mind-boggling.*|PS4|
|[**WellPlayed**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/382/wellplayed) \- [Jordan Garcia](https://opencritic.com/critic/2455/jordan-garcia)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.well-played.com.au/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review/)|*Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an incredible game that was crafted from the ashes of a Tenchu reboot*|PS4|
|[**GamingTrend**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/102/gamingtrend) \- [Bryan Lawver](https://opencritic.com/critic/5026/bryan-lawver)|95 \~ [95 / 100](https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/immortal-blade-sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review/)|*Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice manages to live up to its monstrously high expectations in nearly every way. Its high-risk combat system is as satisfying as it is punishing, and its level design begs you to explore every inch of the world. While its locations and enemies aren't as varied as in previous From Software games, you'll hardly notice when you're locking swords with opponents across several beautiful settings. Sekiro tells an intriguing tale about loyalty and mortality packed with surprises and easy-to-miss side stories.*|PC|
|[**IGN**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign) \- [Brandin Tyrrel](https://opencritic.com/critic/206/brandin-tyrrel)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/21/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review)|*Sekiro evolves From Software’s formula into a stylish stealth-action adventure that, naturally, emphasizes precision and skill in its combat. It walks the line between deliberate and patient stealth and breakneck melee combat against threats both earthly and otherworldly. Its imaginative and flexible tools support a more focused experience that shaves down some of From Software’s overly cryptic sensibilities without losing its air of mystery. Sekiro is an amazing new twist on a familiar set of ideas that can stand on its own alongside its predecessors.*|PS4, XB1, PC|
|[**Atomix**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/458/atomix) \- [Alberto Desfassiaux](https://opencritic.com/critic/3348/alberto-desfassiaux) \- *Spanish*|95 \~ [95 / 100](https://atomix.vg/review-sekiro-shadows-die-twice/)|*Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a masterpiece that you can not miss for nothing.*|PS4|
|[**Easy Allies**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/394/easy-allies) \- [Brad Ellis](https://opencritic.com/critic/2554/brad-ellis)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-xeYJZpH4Y)|*Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an exhilarating journey that demands your full attention. Taking advantage of stealth and mastering its posture-based swordplay is immensely satisfying. Meanwhile, the wonderful, expansive world is a joy to explore thanks to intriguing design and the emphasis on grappling to new heights. Sekiro often feels daunting, leaving you bloodied and broken at its feet, but overcoming each challenge it throws your way fills you with a triumphant sense of accomplishment.* [Written](https://easyallies.com/#!/review/sekiro-shadows-die-twice)|PS4|
|[**Hobby Consolas**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas) \- [David Martinez](https://opencritic.com/critic/2884/david-martinez) \- *Spanish*|94\~ [94 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-sekiro-shadows-die-twice-ps4-xbox-one-pc-proceso-391839)|Sekiro refines (and redefines) the traditional gameplay of the ""Soulsborne"" with the implementation of stealth, the verticality of its levels, a deep and demanding combat style and ""softening"" the elements of RPG. It is an intense experience like few ... but not suitable for all types of players due to its difficulty. |PS4|
|[**Glitched Africa**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/687/glitched-africa) \- [Marco Cocomello](https://opencritic.com/critic/2466/marco-cocomello)|92 \~ [9.2 / 10](https://glitched.africa/reviews/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review/)|*Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a phenomenal experience. It is a long and perilous journey of about 45-50 hours that should keep you busy well into the New Game+. It lacks a multiplayer aspect which is quite a let down for me but everything else is simply perfection. It works so well together and it is all delivered in a beautiful package with a refreshing approach to exploration and combat. It is hard, I am not kidding. You will die and die and die but it is the great adventuring, vast exploration and tough challenge in between all the dying that makes Sekiro an exceptional game.*|PS4|
|[**PC Gamer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/162/pc-gamer) \- [Tom Senior](https://opencritic.com/critic/705/tom-senior)|92 \~ [92 / 100](https://www.pcgamer.com/sekiro-review/)|*A brutal, uncompromising action game with sensational sword combat. From Software has done it again.* |PC|
|[**TrueGaming**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/449/truegaming) \-  Mohammed al-Basimi - *Arabic*|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.true-gaming.net/home/391725/)|*Sekiro gave me an overwhelming sense of freedom in gameplay as there is a whole lot of technique and tools that'll make you feel like a true Ninja once you've mastered them.*|XB1|
|[**Attack of the Fanboy**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/116/attack-of-the-fanboy) \- [Kyle Hanson](https://opencritic.com/critic/597/kyle-hanson)|90 \~ [4.5 / 5 stars](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review/)|*Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a truly new expression of the design philosophy that FromSoftware has spent years refining. Shifting gears a bit in the setting, story, and gameplay, the spirit of Dark Souls is still clearly the driving factor here.*|XB1|
|[**Game Informer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/35/game-informer) \- [Daniel Tack](https://opencritic.com/critic/1031/daniel-tack)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/exaltation-amidst-expiration)|*Sekiro is a wild ride through narrative twists and shocking boss battles, and an amazing triumph or crushing defeat is only ever seconds away*|PS4|
|[**GameSpot**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot) \- [Tamoor Hussain](https://opencritic.com/critic/704/tamoor-hussain)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review-steel-yourself/1900-6417107/)|*More so than in previous games, From Software has honed in on the inherent tension found in the challenging nature of its games, and uses it to incredible effect. Sekiro marries the developer's unique brand of gameplay with stealth action to deliver an experience that is as challenging as it is gratifying.* |PS4|
|[**Gameblog**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog) \- [Jonathan Bushle](https://opencritic.com/critic/3740/jonathan-bushle) \- *French*|90 \~ [9 / 10](http://www.gameblog.fr/tests/3350-sekiro-shadows-die-twice-ps4-xb1-pc)|*Sekiro is a wonderfull game, with great fights, a lot of exploration and a nice, very nice artistic direction. A must have.*|PS4|
|[**GameMAG**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/459/gamemag) \- *Russian*|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://gamemag.ru/reviews/sekiro-shadows-die-twice)|*Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is another great game from FromSoftware that changes the usual formula and creates something new and great on a familiar foundation.*|PS4|
|[**TheSixthAxis**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis) \- [Jason Coles](https://opencritic.com/critic/4870/jason-coles)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/03/21/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review/)|*Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an incredible blend of story, gameplay and world design. I don't think it trumps Bloodborne, personally, but it may well be the next best game that FromSoftware has created.*|PC|
|[**Press Start**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/491/press-start) \- [James Mitchell](https://opencritic.com/critic/3659/james-mitchell)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2019/03/21/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review/)|*Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an intelligent reinvention of the tried and true SoulsBorne formula. It successfully manages to strike a delectable balance between difficult and enjoyable, without the frustrating moments players might’ve experienced in Dark Souls or Bloodborne. Owing to its fast-paced combat that rewards an aggressive approach, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is both fulfilling and satisfying and easily the best of FromSoftware’s games yet.*|*XB1*|
|[**Destructoid**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/90/destructoid) \- [Chris Carter](https://opencritic.com/critic/431/chris-carter)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-in-progress-sekiro-shadows-die-twice-545437.phtml)|*Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice innovates to the point where people who are tired of the same old song and dance will find new mysteries to master, but still maintains that strong marriage of world building and sense of pride garnered from besting taxing conflicts. It's another keeper so long as you're ready to strap in for a tough ride.* |PS4|

You’ll despair as it breaks you down, but then you’ll exult as it builds you up. It’s a journey like little else in gaming, and if you’re up for the challenge, you absolutely have to play it.* |PC|

|[**COGconnected**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected) \- [Garrett Drake](https://opencritic.com/critic/4281/garrett-drake)|88 \~ [88 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review/)|*Overall, I can’t get enough of Sekiro despite being terrible at playing it. It’s a great evolution of the Soulsborne experience with impressive new traversal and combat mechanics in a beautiful world loaded with odd characters and challenging enemies.*|PS4|
|[**Fextralife**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/501/fextralife) \- [Fexelea](https://fextralife.com/author/fexelea/)|88 \~ [8.8 / 10](https://fextralife.com/sekiro-review-shinobis-die-many-times/)|*Sekiro is a great realization of a fantastical Shinobi journey, with challenging but rewarding action-packed gameplay and intricate level design that encourages exploration. Sekiro stands on its own next to acclaimed Souls titles and puts FromSoftware on the action stage with a flourish. At first you hit a wall, then you become the wall the game hits against, and it feels wonderful.*|PS4|

Those who are willing to do so will experience the best samurai fights ever. But the way is hard.*|PC|

|[**IGN Japan**](https://www.metacritic.com/publication/ign-japan?filter=games) \- Satoru Kino - *Japanese*|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://jp.ign.com/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/34130/review/sekiro-shadows-die-twice)|*Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice comes with some obvious flaws: Enemy types repeat too often, and we would have liked more variety in the maps. Having to defeat a boss in order to upgrade your character can become a big problem, too. However, as a stealth game, it offers plenty of routes to explore and ways to assassinate your targets. But above all, the sword fighting system comes with genuinely new ideas, including posture gauge and deflecting attacks, making Sekiro’s battles feel like an art in themselves. While the simplified levelling system and increased reliance on exploration make Sekiro feel even more difficult than FromSoftware’s Dark Souls series and Bloodborne, close combat battles have never been this good.*||

A combat system that after each completed battle gives a great, complete feeling where few games even come close. The key to succeeding in Sekiro is simply dedication. Once you take the step and become one with the game you begin to realize that those old, super-hard NES games might not be so crazy anyway.*|XB1|

Harrowing to the point of emotional exhaustion, some players will bounce off after a few of the meaner boss encounters without the now-classic FromSoftware multiplayer. Brave individuals that persevere, though, will dig through a rich, textured game crammed with spectacular levels and enemy encounters.* |PS4|
|[**Slant Magazine**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/318/slant-magazine) \- [Jed Pressgrove](https://opencritic.com/critic/1316/jed-pressgrove)|40 \~ [2 / 5 stars](https://www.slantmagazine.com/games/review-the-somewhat-punishing-sekiro-shadows-die-twice-coasts-on-borrowed-moves/)|*Its boss fights highlight the contrived lengths that FromSoftware has gone to in order to satisfy players' thirst for difficulty.* ||

Over the summer I’m going to try and make one of these threads every week. 

 The top suggestion in the [last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/68fmiw/what_the_people_who_made_star_wars_knights_of_the/) was System Shock from /u/cell91. The game didn’t have as many credits as the previous games I’ve looked at, so I decided to research System Shock 2 as well. Looking Glass and Irrational (at least the traditional version of it) aren't around anymore, so I won’t be breaking this up into sections this time.

Again, this is not everyone who worked on the game. I left out a lot of the management (like managing director and co-founder of Looking Glass Paul Neurath who currently runs Otherside) and voice actors. With that said, let’s jump in 

**Kemal Amarasingham** worked as an audio technician on System Shock 2. After Looking Glass closed Amarasingham co-founded the audio company dSonic. The company has worked on games including Bioshock, Spec Ops: The Line and Eve Online.

**Marshall Andrews** worked in Origin’s QA team for System Shock. Andrews worked at Origin until 1998 in QA and design, and worked on games including the Ultima series and Bioforge. Andrews next joined Ion Storm and worked on Deus Ex in both QA and design. Andrews joined Amaze Entertainment (which was bought by Foundation 9 years later) in 2002, but I’m unable to verify if he’s still there. 

**Charles Angel** worked as one of Origin’s QA leads for System Shock. I’m unable to find out what Angel is currently doing, but I was able to find an [interview](http://www.pcgamer.com/the-designers-of-dishonored-bioshock-2-and-deus-ex-swap-stories-about-making-pcs-most-complex-games/2/) that stated he was at Eidos a year after Deus Ex shipped (and had a very unique solution to a level). 

**Todd Bailey** worked in Origin’s QA team for System Shock. Bailey became a designer, and was a lead designer on Ultima Online: Renaissance. He left Origin in 1999 to work with Wizards of the Coast on an unreleased game. Next Bailey joined Sony Online and worked as a designer on Star Wars Galaxies before joining NCsoft in 2005 to work on Tabula Rasa. He then joined Heatwave Interactive and was game content designer on Gods & Heroes: Rome Rising. Next Bailey worked at EA and Redfly Studios as a designer. He currently works as creative director at Phaser Lock Interactive.

A few notes/tidbits

* This game was much older than the previous games I've looked at which lead to some slightly different results. I had more trouble tracking down some of the people than with previous threads. The people who worked on the games are much more spread out around the industry.

* Some of the most common studios where people went includes Harmonix, Helixe, Ion Storm, Irrational and Mad Doc. Mad Doc and Harmonix are based in the New England area, where the main part of Looking Glass was based (and Ion Storm had offices close to Looking Glass Austin).

* To tie this back to the last few threads I've made, I was able to find ties to Rockstar and Bioware doing this (and to a studio that worked on a Halo game).

* I only noted it for one or two people, but almost everyone who worked on Freedom Force did voices for the game.

>My complaints about the Resident Evil 2 remaster are minimal. An argument could be made that Capcom could have done more, but the spirit of the original has been preserved and in many cases, enhanced. I hope every legacy game in the series gets this loving treatment, as I'll probably be playing them for the rest of my life.

**EGM** - Mollie L Patterson - [9.5 / 10.0](https://www.egmnow.com/all/resident-evil-2-review/)

>More than just a simple remake of a cherished classic, Resident Evil 2 is a reinvigoration of the entire franchise, showing just how much life it still has left without the need to make drastic gameplay or stylistic changes. From start to end, this is a phenomenal showcase of old mixed with new, both giving players the chance to relive an important chapter in the life of the series under fantastic new conditions, while also potentially paving the way for Resident Evil for years to come.

**Game Revolution** - Jason Faulkner - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.gamerevolution.com/review/485467-resident-evil-2-remake-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc)

>Whether you’re a long time fan or a newcomer, Resident Evil 2 remake is an absolutely fantastic game. It’s the best in the series yet and wholly outshined my most optimistic expectations. It doesn’t supersede the original, but it’s an excellent retelling, a wonderful update, and an excellent experience.

--------------

**Gameblog** - Romain Mahut - *French* - [8 / 10](http://www.gameblog.fr/tests/3286-resident-evil-2-ps4-xb1-pc)

>Recreating Resident Evil 2 20 years later was no easy task but Capcom pulled it off. Resident Evil 2 was handled with love and care and it shows. 2019's Resident Evil 2 is a wonderful Survival Horror that is both terrifying and fun to play. Fans old and new will have a great time with the game. Our only, and minor, complaint is that we wish the remake added more new story content to the original storyline. But other than that, Capcom did the original game justice.

--------------

**GamePro** - Dennis Michel - *German* - [90 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/resident-evil-2-remake-im-test,3339648.html)

--------------

**GamesBeat** - Jeff Grubb - [85 / 100](https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/22/resident-evil-2-review/)

>Finally, Capcom has put a lot of game into Resident Evil 2. It has four remixed campaigns — two each for the playable characters Leon and Claire. But Capcom has also revealed plans to add even more. That includes a mode that randomizes where items are as well as new player characters.

--------------

**GameSpew** - Richard Seagrave - [10 / 10.0](https://www.gamespew.com/2019/01/resident-evil-2-review/)

>Put simply, this re-imagining of Resident Evil 2 is everything a Resident Evil fan could ask for, taking the series back to its roots without feeling old. It is single-player survival horror at its finest, and quite possibly the best Resident Evil game ever made.

**GamesRadar+** - Leon Hurley - [4 / 5 stars](https://www.gamesradar.com/resident-evil-2-remake-review/)

--------------

**GameZone** - Cade Onder - [9 / 10.0](https://www.gamezone.com/reviews/review-resident-evil-2-remake-masterfully-modernizes-a-horror-classic/)

>Resident Evil 2 is a definite remake in every sense of the word. It feels familiar but it's also dressed up to be 100% new for both veterans and newcomers alike. Fans will appreciate the smooth controls that still maintain the classic Resident Evil feel, the genuine feeling of horror, the great puzzles, and much more. Capcom has managed to redeliver a classic in a way that sparks new life into the series and survival horror genre.

--------------

**GamingBolt** - Shubhankar Parijat - [10 / 10.0](https://gamingbolt.com/resident-evil-2-review-modern-classic)

>Resident Evil 2 is not only an accomplished remake that should serve as the blueprint for how to re-imagine beloved classics, but is an incredible game in its own right- so much so, that it might even stand as one of the very best games this venerated and decorated franchise has delivered to date.

--------------

**God is a Geek** - Gary Bailey - [10 / 10.0](https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/resident-evil-2-review/)

--------------

**PlayStation Universe** - Adam Byrne - [9.5 / 10.0](https://www.psu.com/reviews/ps4-resident-evil-2-remake/)

>Capcom has achieved the near-impossible with the remake of Resident Evil 2. A remarkable labour of design, iteration, faithfulness, and adaptation; a masterclass in knowing what to change, how to change it, and what to build upon, Resident Evil 2 in 2018 emerges from the shadow of its namesake with consummate ease.

--------------

**Polygon** - Michael McWhertor - [No Verdict](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/1/22/18192509/resident-evil-2-remake-review)

>Capcom, on a far less dangerous scale, has not always known how to handle its own creation. After mutating from quaint horror to buffoonish action to back again, the Resident Evil series has been wildly inconsistent. But back-to-back Resident Evil games that showcase the very best of survival horror is evidence that Capcom may have its monster under control

--------------

**PowerPyx** - DK - [9.6 / 10.0](http://www.powerpyx.com/resident-evil-2-2019-remake-review/)

>A perfect remake or Resident Evil 2 and an amazing game overall. I got what I expected it to be and even more than that. Definitely a recommendation for fans or the series as well as for everybody else.

**Press Start** - James Mitchell - [10 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2019/01/23/resident-evil-2-review-like-reliving-a-perfect-nightmare/)

>Resident Evil 2 takes a masterpiece and twists it until it resembles something completely new without betraying the spirit of the original. 

--------------

**PSX Brasil** - Ivan Nikolai Barkow Castilho - *Portuguese* - [98 / 100](https://psxbrasil.com.br/analises/analise-resident-evil-2/)

>Resident Evil 2 is an excellent game. The Survival Horror that fans wanted so much is here, the technical aspect is impressive and the various campaigns (even if they have very similar elements) increase the lifespan considerably. Although the remake is not exactly identical to the original, the essence of the 1998 game remains present. Resident Evil 2 is a must-have title in your collection.

**Push Square** - Liam Croft - [8 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/resident_evil_2)

--------------

**Rely On Horror** - Rourke Keegan - [10 / 10.0](https://www.relyonhorror.com/reviews/review-resident-evil-2-2019/)

>Packed with nostalgia, new challenges, complex and deep gameplay that doesn’t just adapt but embodies the genre it’s inhabiting, and a AAA presentation that blows every previous RE out of the water — yes, even REmake — I feel confident in this assessment: As it was in 1998, so to shall it be in 2019. Resident Evil 2 is the best Resident Evil game ever made, full stop.

**Rock, Paper, Shotgun** - Matt Cox - [No Verdict](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/01/22/resident-evil-2-review/)

>That’s where Resident Evil succeeds. Not in the drivel spouted from its character’s mouths, but in the bullets spewed from their guns. Or better yet – the clicking of empty chambers, or the spine-chilling scratches of scrabbling overhead. I may hate lickers, but I’m also a little bit in love.

**Saudi Gamer** - Unknown - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://saudigamer.com/review/resident-evil-2-remake/)

**Screen Rant** - Zak Wojnar - [4 / 5 stars](https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-2-review/)

**Shacknews** - Brittany Vincent - [9 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/109460/resident-evil-2-review-return-to-raccoon-city)

>You’ll also come across quite a few surprises in terms of boss encounters and scenes that definitely weren’t in the original game that I won’t spoil here, but suffice it to say, you’ll be left with your jaw hanging open. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t take the opportunity to flesh out or expand on some of the more ambiguous parts of the Resident Evil lore, which I would have liked to see, but given that it does deliver with new content all its own, that’s not a huge issue.

>If 2017’s Resident Evil 7 was a return to form for the long-in-the-tooth horror brand, the Resident Evil 2 remake is proof that Capcom never really lost its touch—it only lost its way.

>Resident Evil 2 is one of the best remakes we've ever seen: it's a bit different from the classical survival horror released in 1998, while still remaining true to the original game.

>Resident Evil 2 is a successful resurrection of the original and it's an action game worthy of every fan of the genre and not only those who loved the original.

--------------

**Twinfinite** - Zhiqing Wan - [4.5 / 5.0](https://twinfinite.net/2019/01/resident-evil-2-remake-review/)

>The Resident Evil 2 remake is, indeed, the best Resident Evil game ever released. I see that now. It brings back everything that fans loved from the PS1 classic, and presents it in a fresh way that's both exciting and nostalgic in a modern age. Survival horror isn't dead, inform the press that Resident Evil really is back.

--------------

**USgamer** - Matthew Kim - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/resident-evil-2-review)

>The sense of fear and terror when playing Resident Evil 2 never leaves you. It's unlike anything else I've encountered in a Resident Evil game previously. I'm just going to go ahead and call it: Resident Evil 2 is the best Resident Evil game in the franchise and represents a series and developer at its peak. Don't be distracted by the pretty graphics and gore, Resident Evil 2 is straight-up dangerous.

--------------

**VideoGamer** - Michael Harradence - [9 / 10](http://www.videogamer.com//reviews/resident-evil-2-review)

>Resident Evil 2 is more than a remake of a classic game, it's one of the most accomplished horror titles you'll play for a long time

--------------

**Wccftech** - Nathan Birch - [8.5 / 10.0](https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-2-remake/)

>Resident Evil 2 is a polished, respectful remake of a survival horror classic that probably would have benefitted from a slightly more daring approach. Hints of a braver revamp are sprinkled throughout, but it doesn't take the risks necessary to join the canon of truly great video game remakes. Make no mistake though, if you loved the original Resident Evil 2, you'll likely love the remake, and new players who can tolerate a few old-school quirks ought to have gruesome good time as well.

**Windows Central** - Jez Corden - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.windowscentral.com/resident-evil-2-xbox-review)

**ZTGD** - Anthony Mann - [10 / 10.0](http://www.ztgd.com/reviews/resident-evil-2-ps4/)

**Areajugones** - Víctor Rodríguez - *Spanish* - [5 / 10.0](https://areajugones.sport.es/fallout-76-fecha-lanzamiento-ficha/analisis-fallout-76/)

>Fallout 76 is a failed experiment. A game that, even with some good points, ultimately fails to deliver an entertaining experience due to its terrible combat system and some technical problems.

--------------

**Atomix** - Alberto Desfassiaux - *Spanish* - [55 / 100](https://atomix.vg/review-fallout-76/)

>Fallout 76 has a lot of technical difficulties that makes it a pretty uncomfortable and frustrating experience. Also, its new ideas doesn't work a lot. A huge disappointment.

--------------

**Attack of the Fanboy** - Kyle Hanson - [2.5 / 5 stars](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/fallout-76-review/)

>Fallout 76 is a bold experiment with one of gaming's biggest and most beloved franchises. Unfortunately the experiment seems like a failure so far.

--------------

**BaziCenter** - Milad Taher Nejad - *Persian* - [5 / 10.0](http://www.bazicenter.com/?p=755632)

>The main problem with Fallout 76 is that it is built by a company who is specialized at creating solid single-player titles, and the result is countless bugs and technical issues. Maybe Bethesda is laying foundation and gaining experience for future MMO titles, or maybe they’ll improve it by releasing patches and stuff, but at its current state, Fallout 76 is a not a title worthy of Fallout name.

--------------

**Cerealkillerz** - Manuel Barthes - *German* - [7.3 / 10.0](https://cerealkillerz.org/review-fallout-76-eine-postapokalyptische-reise-mit-vielen-hindernissen/)

>Although Fallout 76 looks like Fallout 4 right from the start, there are some technical and play-related drawbacks. The V.A.T.S., which acts as the showpiece of the series, comes too short due to the online component, which enormously reduces the RPG portion. Even though this is a multiplayer title that takes place in a huge game world, Fallout 76 looks frighteningly unfinished for a full-price title. Away from these criticisms, you can expect an enormously extensive Appalachia full of adventure, which together with friends offers numerous hours of fun!

--------------

**CGMagazine** - Preston Dozsa - [3 / 10.0](https://www.cgmagonline.com/reviews/fallout-76-ps4-review/)

>Fallout 76 shows potential, but it can’t quite coalesce into a compelling game due to numerous glaring flaws.

--------------

**Cheat Code Central** - Sean Engemann - [3.7 / 5.0](http://www.cheatcc.com/ps4/rev/fallout76review.html)

>Bethesda claims that the Fallout 76 servers will last “forever” and, while it may not take that long to patch bugs and improve the experience, my foray with the launch version has left me with an abundance of bullet points that need attention. My biggest hope is that Bethesda will take our suggestions and criticisms as a call to action to tweak the faulty mechanics and build more features into a game that has a ton of potential.

--------------

**Critical Hit** - Alessandro Barbosa - [4 / 10.0](https://www.criticalhit.net/review/fallout-76-review-mutually-assured-boredom/)

>Fallout 76's mundane quest and lifeless story put too much weight on the aged combat and trivial crafting for them to bear. It's a multiplayer experiment with far too many flaws to put up with, both in its limiting player interactions and its woeful technical polish. Fallout with friends is still an idea that could work one, but that's not what Fallout 76 is serving up.

--------------

**Destructoid** - Unknown - [No Verdict](https://www.destructoid.com/review-in-progress-fallout-76-531390.phtml)

>This is why I'm ultimately enjoying Fallout 76. Yes, the game's systems push back every opportunity they get and that's oftentimes frustrating. This is certainly the entry that strays furthest from what people loved about Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. But Fallout has created a universe where every region's history is worth learning. It holds true for West Virginia, even if I can't shake the feeling that this will be the least memorable of Fallout's stories. Well, unless you and your friends create your own memories.

--------------

**DigitalCentralMedia** - Jordan Micheal - [16%](http://digitalcentralmedia.co.uk/fallout-76-review/)

>Fallout 76 is one of the worst games of this year. It's a huge mess and Bethesda must go back to the basics after this game.

--------------

**EGM** - Nick Plessas - [6 / 10.0](https://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/fallout-76-review/)

>Many of the issues Fallout 76 currently faces could eventually be fixed, which is why this mess is such a pity. The potential is clear, but a reluctance to commit to one direction or another leaves the game in an awkward and broken void.

--------------

**Eurogamer** - Wesley Yin-Poole - [Avoid](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-20-fallout-76-review-a-bizarre-boring-and-broken-mess)

--------------

**Gadgets 360** - Rishi Alwani - [5 / 10](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/fallout-76-review-1948639)

--------------

**Game Informer** - Andrew Reiner - [6 / 10.0](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/fallout-76/over-encumbered)

>When Fallout 76 is working as intended, it's an easy game to lose yourself in, as meaningful discoveries are everywhere. But those moments are often destroyed by glitches, crashes, and technical issues

--------------

**Gameblog** - Jonathan Bushle - *French* - [6 / 10](http://www.gameblog.fr/tests/3225-fallout-76-ps4)

>Fallout 76 is a good coop Fallout in a new charming land, but a poor solo Fallout, and a poor survival game, with poor graphics.

**GameCrate** - Christopher Atwood - [7.5 / 10.0](http://www.gamecrate.com/reviews/review-fallout-76-delivers-radioactive-survival-fun-despite-serious-issues/21461)

>Fallout 76 might have a bright future ahead of it, but ultimately, Fallout 76 is a multiplayer survival game set in the Fallout universe, not a Fallout game where you get to play with your friends.

--------------

**Gamefa** - Mohammad Mahdi Hossein Zadeh - *Persian* - [6.5 / 10.0](https://gamefa.com/514960/%d8%ac%d9%86%da%af%d8%8c-%d8%ac%d9%86%da%af-%d8%b9%d9%88%d8%b6-%d8%b4%d8%af%d9%87-%e2%80%8c-%d9%86%d9%82%d8%af-%d9%88-%d8%a8%d8%b1%d8%b1%d8%b3%db%8c-fallout-76/)

>Fallout 76 is not the game that we expected from Bethesda and its high quality standards of its games (specially with the name of Fallout), but it does not mean that it's completely a bad game. Fallout 76's world is so beautiful with unique art style of Fallout games but on the other hand it's really bad in the story-telling and design. Gameplay is fun but also it isn't perfect. The point is, None of these is the main problem of the game. The main problem with Fallout 76 is that it lost its identity.The problem is that the game has not been able to maintain the boundary between a multiplayer game and a single player game, specially a Fallout. Fallout 76 does not disappoint fans of the series, but those who expected Bethesda to create an amazing game (like almost every Bethesda's games) with the label of Fallout, have to wait more.

--------------

**GameMAG** - ASarafanov - *Russian* - [5 / 10](https://gamemag.ru/reviews/fallout-76)

>Fallout 76 requires serious rework. Strange decisions of game designers make it difficult to comfortably explore an interesting world of the game. Interaction with other players is minimal and absolutely unjustified for an online project. Sometimes it feels that there is no online at all. New mechanics do not look as impressive as we were promised during the early presentations, and the lack of optimization, ton of bugs and a terrible economy spoil the experience. Bethesda needs to rethink its production process, do serious work on all the errors, add normal PvP and full-fledged quests with NPCs.

--------------

**Gamers Heroes** - Johnny Hurricane - [5 / 10](http://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/fallout-76-review/)

>Fallout 76 feels like an early access title and should have been labeled as such. The game was not ready for launch, and even hardcore Fallout fans will have a hard time ignoring its problems.

--------------

**Gamersky** - 楚楠 - [7.6 / 10.0](https://www.gamersky.com/review/201811/1124734.shtml)

>Exploring is still the most interesting part in Fallout 76, but your adventure tour is limited by empty open-world, and outdated graphics performance. It is more like a MMO mod of Fallout 4, rather than a brand-new work.

--------------

**GameSpace** - Robert Baddeley - [7.2 / 10.0](https://www.gamespace.com/reviews/fallout-76-review/)

>Fallout 76 would have been best served by a longer, continuous B.E.T.A. cycle.  Numerous small issues like bugs, stash size, push-to-talk, and other quality of life issues could have been identified before asking people to spend $60 and working on them after release.  Despite this faux pas, there is still a tremendous amount of fun to be had either solo or with friends.  Multiplayer is a wonderful addition to the Fallout franchise and the world created in West Virginia is unique, gorgeous, and fun to explore.  It may not be in line to win any awards but if you enjoyed the previous installation, Fallout 4, it's quite likely you'll find the same fun in Bethesda's Fallout 76.

--------------

**GameSpew** - Richard Seagrave - [2 / 10.0](https://www.gamespew.com/2018/11/fallout-76-review/)

>I really hope Fallout 76 is turned around, I really do. I have a lot of respect for Bethesda for publishing quality single player releases such as The Evil Within 2, but Fallout 76 is just dire. It shouldn’t have seen the light of day, and you shouldn’t buy it

--------------

**GameSpot** - Edmond Tran - [4 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-76-review-scorched-earth/1900-6417040/)

>Fallout's mutation into an online multiplayer hybrid leaves it weak and soulless.

--------------

**GamesRadar+** - Zoe Delahunty-Light - [2.5 / 5 stars](https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-76-review/)

>Fallout 76 has glimmers of the trademark series' sci-fi splendour, but they're few and far between.

--------------

**GamingBolt** - Shubhankar Parijat - [4 / 10.0](https://gamingbolt.com/fallout-76-review-fundamentally-flawed)

>Fallout 76 is not a completely broken game. It's not absolutely devoid of enjoyment, and every once in a while, it can live up to the franchise name it bears. The problem is that that enjoyment is buried under a mountainous pile of long stretches of boredom and emptiness, tedious and mind-numbing quests, baffling design choices, unbelievably bad technical issues, and a host of other problems that turn this into an experience that, frankly, has no business being out on shelves as a full-priced AAA game in its current state. What's concerning is that even if the issues that can be fixed through patches and updates are ironed out, the core fundamentals of the game are deeply flawed.

--------------

**GearNuke** - Humad Ali Shah - [5.5 / 10.0](https://gearnuke.com/fallout-76-review-xbox-one/)

>If I had to describe Fallout 76, I will say it is a flawed idea that never works well. It is simply broken and feels boring but offers a redeeming factor with the open world exploration in some well-crafted environments. The buggy nature of the game is its biggest hurdle and some quality of life changes will go a long way in molding it into something enjoyable in the future.

--------------

**Generación Xbox** - Alberto Rocha - *Spanish* - [7.8 / 10.0](https://generacionxbox.com/analisis-de-fallout-76/)

>With the classical Bethesda core gameplay that all we love, and also the old flaws (with a bunch of new additions) Fallout 76 is possibly the worst modern Fallout, but the worst Fallout is still a title a lot of games would want for themselves.

--------------

**GRYOnline.pl** - Patryk Manelski - *Polish* - [5.5 / 10.0](https://www.gry-online.pl/S020.asp?ID=13070)

>Fallout 76 is a broken, unfinished and ""un-SPECIAL"" game that consists of many cut-down elements. Despite that, it can be enjoyable for players who love to explore the post-apocalyptic world and invent their own, private role-playing story. F76 looks so constrained that it should have been released as a paid DLC to Fallout 4. Shame.

--------------

**Guardian** - Holly Nielsen - [2 / 5 stars](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/nov/19/fallout-76-review-playstation-xbox-pc)

>Half-baked conflict ideas and witless quests to unearth the dead – this soulless sequel is perfect if you enjoy picking up rubbish in a wasteland

--------------

**Hobby Consolas** - Álvaro Alonso - *Spanish* - [65 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-fallout-76-ps4-xbox-one-pc-331311)

>Behind a mess of technical problems and bad decisiones, hides a Fallout: a post-apocalyptic survival game, with mechanics from another era, but undoubtedly fun. If you can see beyond all the mistakes and consider yourself a fan of the universe, you may enjoy Fallout 76 (especially playing with others), but there's still a lo to do to improve.

--------------

**IGN** - Brandin Tyrrel - [5 / 10.0](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/21/fallout-76-review)

>The rich wasteland map of Fallout 76 is wasted on a mess of bugs, conflicting ideas, and monotony.

>Neither in its concept nor in its execution has convinced us the first Fallout Online, which perhaps should have looked a little more in the mirror of The Elder Scrolls: Online for its debut. Will it come back? Only time will tell.

--------------

**Just Push Start** - Oliver East - [3.5 / 5.0](https://www.justpushstart.com/2018/11/fallout-76-review/)

>Whether swapping NPC conversations for other players works is a bit subjective, though the change is not as severe a detriment to the experience as expected. While the roots of Fallout 76 are firmly in Fallout 4 the final gameplay experience is quite different and so there's no guarantee that fans of that game will enjoy it. Fallout 76 is worthy of recommendation with two caveats. You have to go in expecting a light multiplayer survival game in an interesting setting, rather than a deep story-focused role-playing game. On top of this, Fallout 76 is a game that really is better with friends, as that is the real replacement for the NPC dialogue in the world – if you're going in as a solo player you might come away dissatisfied.

--------------

**Merlin'in Kazanı** - Furkan Sakoğlu - *Turkish* - [65 / 100](https://www.merlininkazani.com/Fallout_76-oyun_inceleme-104648p1.html)

>Fallout 76 is one of the games which makes us uncertain. I can't call it a complete trash, but can't call it a good game either. But somehow, I believe in it. If Bethesda keeps working hard on the game, in a year, it will become a game which deserves to be played.

**Metro GameCentral** - GameCentral - [3 / 10](https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/21/fallout-76-review-a-bad-idea-poorly-executed-8162807/)

>A disastrous failure whose technical shortcomings may one day be fixed but whose design failings, and obliviousness to its own potential, suggests a game that is irrevocably broken.

--------------

**Nexus** - Sam Aberdeen - [6 / 10.0](https://nexushub.co.za/nexus/fallout-76.html)

>Fallout 76 boasts an impressive open world in West Virginia, but it's a lonely journey on the country roads. It's greatest aspects are buried under a myriad of nagging technical issues.

--------------

**Niche Gamer** - Brandon Orselli - [6.5 / 10.0](https://nichegamer.com/reviews/fallout-76-review/)

>All in all, Fallout 76 comes off as the core gameplay experience you’d find in Fallout 4, only with multiplayer sort of tacked on somehow. There’s no real overarching story and no NPCs to really speak of, and yet there’s a giant map to explore and collect things while just getting stronger. It’s the modern Bethesda Fallout experience, distilled to that core gameplay loop.

**NoobFeed** - Adam Siddiqui - [55 / 100](https://www.noobfeed.com/reviews/1521/fallout-76-xbox-one-x-review)

>Fallout 76 entices that same feeling of exploring a vast open world full of unknown locations in a vast world. Constantly uncovering hidden areas and finding exotic items is here but it's hindered by the game's massive technical problems and multiplayer balancing problems. Fallout 76 is a technical mess that will have you fighting the game itself.

--------------

**Oyungezer Online** - Emir Ataç - *Turkish* - [6 / 10.0](http://oyungezer.com.tr/haber/55211-fallout-76-inceleme)

>Different, confused but still a Fallout game in its essence. I really hope updates will help Fallout 76 to reach its potential one day.

--------------

**PC Gamer** - Christopher Livingston - [60 / 100](https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-review/)

>A beautifully crafted but ultimately repetitive world, and a disappointment when it comes to options on PC.

--------------

**PCGamesN** - Julian Benson - [5 / 10](https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76-pc-review)

>Fallout 76 isn't to be compared with other Fallouts - it's a spin-off that wants to be something new. Unfortunately, the multiplayer sandbox it tries to be is stagnant and intensely frustrating to play.

--------------

**PlayStation LifeStyle** - Dylan Bishop - [6 / 10.0](https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2018/11/21/fallout-76-ps4-review/)

>I want to love Fallout 76, namely for its addition of co-op play and the representation of a region dear to my heart. I simply can't. I wouldn't say the latest Fallout title is abysmal or even bad, just very middling. It removes many of the series' strong suits and attempts to make up for it by adding in new mechanics or strengthening lesser ones. That move creates interesting situations, but they don't always pay off for the player. The story falters, the crafting and building doesn't fulfill, and the exploration means next to nothing. Fallout 76 is just barely good at best, when you're jaunting around with your friends. But at its worst, it's vapid, basic, and boring, meaning I'd rather see co-op and the wild and wonderful West Virginia in any other adventure.

--------------

**PlayStation Universe** - Garri Bagdasarov - [7 / 10.0](https://www.psu.com/reviews/fallout-76-review/)

>Fallout 76 is a blast to play. It's easily my favorite Fallout title to date.  Fallout 76 has it's fair share of problems but they don't make the game unplayable. Fallout 76 isn't for everyone but for those who stick with it will definitely find what it has to offer.

--------------

**Push Square** - Robert Ramsey - [3 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/fallout_76)

>Fallout 76 is a seriously shoddy attempt at trying to cash in on the multiplayer survival market. Fallout with friends is an intriguing concept on paper, but we can't think of many more ways that Bethesda could have screwed it up. 

--------------

**RPG Site** - Bryan Vitale - [5 / 10](http://www.rpgsite.net/review/8011-fallout-76-review)

**SECTOR.sk** - Branislav Kohút - [7 / 10.0](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/32035/fallout-76.htm)

--------------

**Softpedia** - Andrei Dobra - [6 / 10.0](https://www.softpedia.com/reviews/games/pc/fallout-76-review-523836.shtml)

>With some more time and more inspired gameplay design, it could have been a much better experience. Right now, unfortunately, its great world feels like a missed opportunity that's mostly not fun, only in very few scenarios and for very few people. Bethesda proved with The Elder Scrolls Online that it can turn things around but 76 may require some sweeping changes until it's ready to be recommended to others.

**The Digital Fix** - Stephen Hudson - [5 / 10.0](https://www.thedigitalfix.com/gaming/content/11751/fallout-76/)

>Despite Appalachia's appeal, Fallout 76 is broken mess of a game that, in its current state, feels nothing more than a shamefully unfinished cash-grab that isn't fit to use the Fallout name.

--------------

**The Games Machine** - Daniele Dolce - *Italian* - [6.2 / 10.0](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/fallout-76/fallout-76-recensione-pc-ps4-xbox-one/)

>Putting aside the many technical issues, Fallout 76 offers an empty world in which, paradoxically, there are many things to do, but everything appears to be an end in itself. There is something good in this game, but it's crippled by a bland world design and a non-existent plot. This is a game that may be able to entertain, but boredom is always dangerously around the corner.

**TheSixthAxis** - Jason Coles - [3 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/16/fallout-76-review/)

>Fallout 76 had a lot to say when it was revealed. It was multiplayer, it had the largest world of any Fallout, it was going to be fun. The trouble is that it just doesn't work, the world is too big and empty, and the quest design as uninspired as it gets. If the only way for a game to be entertaining is by having your friends make jokes about it as you journey together, then it has failed at one of the things that most games should be. It has failed at being fun, it has failed at being entertaining in its own right. If you want to hang out with some friends in an a post-apocalypse, then just go to a pub and watch the news.

--------------

**TrustedReviews** - Alastair Stevenson - [3.5 / 5 stars](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/fallout-76)

>Fallout 76 is one of the most interesting entries to the series since Fallout 3. The addition of multiplayer elements to the apocalyptic wasteland should on paper make for a wonderfully immersive, tense experience, and for a good while it does. Playing with buddies looting collapsed shopping centres and derelict towns is a blast and the robust crafting and character development mechanics are excellent.

>Fallout 76 lacks the heart and soul of what is a Bethesda RPG. The exclusion of NPC's and, in general, decent quest givers makes an emotional (or any) connection to the world near-on impossible and manages to shatter any immersion. The inclusion of other humans does nothing to remedy the fact that these core elements are missing. What it does do right, though, is having built by far the most varied and engaging Map yet, which is a pleasure to look at and explore - even if it looks dated up close. Furthermore, teaming up with other people to take on high-end creatures, particularly after the launch of a nuke, makes for compelling gameplay. As can be expected from a Bethesda title, it's riddled with bugs and glitches, many are game breaking, though Bethesda is already working on fixing them. What Fallout 76 really needs is an infusion of NPC's, even if only at a single hub, to give the game purpose.

**Xbox Achievements** - Dan Webb - [65%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/fallout-76/review/)

>Fallout 76 is effectively about base-construction, survival and world-building, not the story and your part in it, which isn’t a bad thing. The execution is though.

Reviews
--------------------

**GamesRadar+** - David Houghton - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.gamesradar.com/titanfall-2-review/) (PS4)

>Intelligent, creative, and never less than thrilling, Titanfall 2 finally realises the series' true potential with verve and polish.

--------------

**NZGamer** - Ben Wilson - [8.2 / 10](http://nzgamer.com/reviews/2520/titanfall-2.html) (PS4)

>Titanfall 2 is the game the original Titanfall was trying to be. A compromise on some multiplayer content has made a better envisioned game with a story that’s resonant in the smaller moments but extraneous in the larger ones. It’s very much a direct translation from Titanfall’s multiplayer. Being uniquely eclectic, Titanfall 2 is designed just well enough, and with enough layers so to not be entirely derivative. Hero simulations are so vastly abundant in this industry - so if you’re going to play one, you might as well choose from those who do it the best.

--------------

**PlayStation LifeStyle** - Paulmichael Contreras - [9 / 10](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2016/10/24/titanfall-2-review-titanic-mayhem-ps4/) (PS4)

>Titanfall 2 is the new king of the FPS hill. Controls are tight, action is fierce, maps are intricately designed, and Titans are badass. The cherry on top is a campaign that is genuinely enjoyable, and one that fans of the first game are likely to be satisfied with, which expands upon the universe of the series. Group all of this together with an ambitious free DLC plan, and the choice of which shooter to buy this holiday season becomes obvious. Titanfall 2 is second to none.

--------------

**Polygon** - Arthur Gies - [7 / 10](http://www.polygon.com/2016/10/24/13377822/titanfall-2-review-xbox-one-PC-ps4-playstation-4) (PS4, XB1, PC)

>Titanfall 2 has the basics down, but loses much of the focus

>Consistency is a problem for Titanfall 2 in general, and it's a game that seems to struggle with a confident direction for its changes. The end result is a collection of fantastic mechanics across its campaign and its multiplayer that often feel hamstrung by difficult to understand design choices. There's clearly more here than before, and the package is offering something more ""complete"" by today's standards. But Titanfall 2 throws the series' dynamics off enough to make for something that just doesn't quite click together as well as it did before.

--------------

**TheSixthAxis** - Stefan L - [9 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/24/titanfall-2-review/) (PS4, PC)

>On the one hand, you have a short, but fun single player that’s more free and open than most FPS campaign, and on the other, a multiplayer that’s an iterative improvement on an already fantastic game. In other words, Titanfall 2 is as exhilarating and refreshing now as the original was back in 2014.

--------------

**USgamer** - Jaz Rignall - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/titanfall-2-ps4-review) (PS4)

>Although it's a little on the short side, and its production values are a bit oldschool, Titanfall 2's single-player campaign is a really enjoyable experience while it lasts. It's very inventive and fun, and a great warm-up for the game's excellent multiplayer component, whose gunplay and controls are absolutely outstanding. All it needs is a few more maps and modes.

--------------

**Xbox Achievements** - Dom Peppiatt - [85%](http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/titanfall-2/review/) (XB1)

>Titanfall’s now-classic speed works so well in this game - Respawn has studied everything that made the original game so enjoyable in multiplayer and built a solid story experience around those elements. The multiplayer is evolving, and whilst some may argue it's getting top-heavy, we truly believe that every alteration Respawn has made to the core Titanfall experience has been for the better, resulting in a stronger, better and more robust sequel.

--------------

**GameSpot** - Mike Mahardy - [9 / 10](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/titanfall-2-review/1900-6416561/?ftag=GSS-05-10aaa0b) (PS4, XB1)

>Titanfall 2 is more measured and intelligent than its predecessor, but just as fluid and kinetic.

--------------

**GamingTrend** - Christian DeCoster - [85 / 100](http://gamingtrend.com/reviews/stand-clean-for-titanfall-titanfall-2-review/) (PS4, PC)

>Overall, Titanfall 2 takes the great ideas of its predecessors and expands upon them to create a far superior experience. While the campaign is a little short, it’s still a lot of fun and incredibly replayable.

--------------

**Hardcore Gamer** - Kevin Dunsmore - [4.5 / 5](http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/10/24/review-titanfall-2/232065/) (PS4)

>Titanfall 2 takes what works with the original and builds on it. The same addicting momentum-based movement system is back and it’s still fun to use. Built on top of this is a campaign that, while not the most original, manages to create a relationship that feels genuine with a unique mission structure that embraces the movement system to create unique gameplay scenarios.

--------------

**Trusted Reviews** - Stuart Andrews - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.trustedreviews.com/titanfall-2-review) (PS4, XB1, PC)

>Titanfall 2’s campaign is one of the best surprises of the autumn 2016 season; smart, superbly-paced and packed with action, it tramples over the likes of Halo 5 and Killzone: Shadow Fall, making this the new sci-fi shooter for CoD: Infinite Warfare to beat.

--------------

**Digital Spy** - Stuart Andrews - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/review/a797595/titanfall-2-review-preview-gameplay/) (PS4)

>This isn't just a worthy sequel to Titanfall, but one that improves upon the original while adding a superb single-player campaign. The latter combines fast-paced action, pilot acrobatics, heavyweight Titan warfare and a surprising amount of heart in one of the most enjoyable solo storylines of the year.

--------------

**Stevivor** - Ben Salter - [8 / 10](http://stevivor.com/2016/10/review-titanfall-2/) (XB1, PC)

>As ridiculous as it sounds, Titanfall 2 is more down-to-Earth than most AAA shooters. There are still big explosions and unrelenting death, but rather than focusing on those, some sincere moments between Cooper and BT rise to the surface.

--------------

**IGN** - Brandin Tyrrel - [Review-In-Progress](http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/titanfall-2-review?page=1) (PS4)

>Respawn has doubled down on its compelling formula of breakneck movement and grandiose scale, tapping the vein of those literal and figurative explosive moments that we brag about afterwards. And this time around, the first game’s lacking single-player component has been addressed with admirable results, offering an engaging trek through a universe that was begging to be fleshed out.

--------------

**GameCrate** - Quibian Salazar-Moreno - [9.0 / 10](http://www.gamecrate.com/reviews/review-titanfall-2-sequel-we-all-wanted/14822) (XB1)

>Titanfall 2 is the sequel that Titanfall fans wanted. A great and satisfying single player campaign. A filled out and content rich multiplayer. And a host of new titans with their own characteristics and specialties. Titanfall 2 is definitely a winner.

--------------

**Game Informer** - Javy Gwaltney - [9.5 / 10](http://www.gameinformer.com/themes/blogs/generic/post.aspx?WeblogApp=playstation4&y=2016&m=10&d=24&WeblogPostName=striking-a-fine-balance&GroupKeys=games/titanfall_2/) (PS4)

>Titanfall 2 is that rare game where both its single-player and multiplayer modes are exceptional and highly entertaining in their own ways

--------------

**AusGamers** - Joaby - [7.3 / 10](http://www.ausgamers.com/reviews/read.php/3561691) (PC)

>I think Titanfall 2 is worth playing, but it's not a must-play game right now. The two levels that I think will influence game design for years to come--they'll still be there next year. But therein lies the rub--with a playerbase split over multiple pointless variants of team deathmatch and a handful of other standard multiplayer modes, the population might not be there next year when you get it. 

>*The final score is representative of the game in this state and may change when the game is live later this week.

--------------

**Game Revolution** - Peter Paras - [4.0 / 5 stars](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/titanfall-2) (PS4)

>18 months after Respawn Entertainment debuted their big proof-of-concept project, Titanfall 2 delivers on the promise made by such an idea, and amazingly, goes even further. The single-player campaign is a blast while the multiplayer is solid if only slightly underwhelming. Kudos to the developer for creating a work of fun that made me chuckle, smile, and feel good. Who knew an iron giant, accompanied by clever level design, would steal my heart?

--------------

**Easy Allies** - Ben Moore - [4 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs8mVm8Irnc) (PS4, XB1, PC)

--------------

**Giant Bomb** - Jeff Gerstmann - [5 / 5 stars](http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/titanfall-2-review/1900-756/) (PS4)

>Titanfall 2 goes for feel above all else, and it feels fantastic.

--------------

**Shacknews** - Cassidee Moser - [Review-In-Progress](http://www.shacknews.com/article/97364/titanfall-2-review-in-progress-the-iron-giant) (PS4)

>Titanfall 2 is good. Story campaign aside, it doesn’t do much to differentiate itself from other military shooters. But the things it does do well give it more life and personality than it had in its previous iteration, and the fact that it feels so damn good to play makes a strong case for it being worth playing.

--------------

**NZGamer** - Ben Wilson - [8.2 / 10](http://nzgamer.com/reviews/2520/titanfall-2.html) (PS4)

>Being uniquely eclectic, Titanfall 2 is designed just well enough, and with enough layers so to not be entirely derivative. Hero simulations are so vastly abundant in this industry - so if you’re going to play one, you might as well choose from those who do it the best.

--------------

**Daily Dot** - Sarah Weber - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/titanfall-2-review/) (XB1)

>Titanfall 2 builds on the promises of the first game in every way imaginable. Rewarding gameplay innovations remain intact, providing consistent thrills in both multiplayer matches and the campaign. Fans of the genre will find themselves blown away by the unique level design, even if the narrative fails to stand tall.

The hair seems to have become much thicker as I think back, but the truth is that if there were even a handful of first-person shooters this strange and spectacular released in any given year, I’d barely find time to play anything else. In a week that has seen speculation about the future of this type of big budget singleplayer game, for all its flaws, this is a reminder of how powerful and vital they can be.*|PC
**Ars Technica** - [Sam Machkovech](http://opencritic.com/critic/2302/sam-machkovech)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-review-a-few-bumps-on-the-road-to-epic-combat/)|*Fans of the predecessor should snap this up ASAP. More casual shooter fans should tread cautiously.*|PC
**Kotaku** - [Heather Alexandra](http://opencritic.com/critic/1942/heather-alexandra)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-the-kotaku-review-1819979622)|*The New Colossus crafts a world that can deliver exciting action and human drama. The messy gunfights give way to something much larger. The New Colossus examines violence, resistance, and the necessity of revolution. It’s bloody and occasionally silly but never stupid or crass. It comes down firmly on the side of punching Nazis and throwing bricks, concluding that such resistance isn’t just cathartic but essential.*|PC
**AngryCentaurGaming** - [Jeremy Penter](http://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter)|Buy ~ [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc9xgfLwzY4)|*This is easily a 'Buy', even though it is a single-player game [and] doesn't have a multi-player. The fact is that Wolfenstein is really enjoyable as a title and it does have some open areas that could offer you a good amount of flexibility and replayability. They have a ton of things you can find, secrets, and so forth that could definitely keep you returning if you're that kind of fan.*|PC

**Cheat Code Central** - [Lucas White](http://opencritic.com/critic/3680/lucas-white)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](http://www.cheatcc.com/ps4/rev/wolfensteinIInewcolossusreview.html)|*When I jumped in, I wasn’t sure what to expect, especially with so much of the marketing playing up the comedic elements. What I got was more of what I liked in The New Order, but on a much larger scale, with ambitions that cared little for AAA conventions and comforts. Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a project that wears its heart on its sleeve, and that sleeve is on a bright yellow motorcycle jacket with a red devil on the back that is being worn by a Texan Terminator who finds great joy in hacking away at Nazi soldiers with a hatchet.*|
**PCWorld** - [Hayden Dingman](http://opencritic.com/critic/1180/hayden-dingman)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3235216/gaming/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-review.html)|*The New Order was a silly game that occasionally got serious. The New Colossus is a serious game that sometimes cracks a smile.*|PC

The sheer amount of freedom that players have to go along with the excellent gunplay make it one of the best shooters in years on those merits alone. Add in what is one the year's most compelling, important narratives and you have a recipe for an instant classic on your hands. Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus isn't just 2017's best shooter, it's a game that will be looked back upon as one of the standout titles of this generation when it comes to an end.*|PS4

They've created one of the most ridiculous video games ever made, and one that is never afraid to be clear about its message of equality & justice. While it's easy to focus on the over-the-top story beats and memorable scenes, The New Colossus is carried by an incredible amount of heart from start to finish.*|PS4
**GamingTrend** - [Travis Northup](http://opencritic.com/critic/481/travis-northup)|95 ~ [95 / 100](http://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/absurd-reich-wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-review/)|*In 2014 MachineGames made a statement with Wolfenstein: The New Order. Now, with Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, they’ve written their manifesto. It’s easily one of the best games you’ll play all year.*|XB1

BJ and his crew are full of spirit and personality, and General Engel is as memorable a nemesis as you're likely to find in games. Machine Games has once again turned the well-worn act of mowing down Nazis into something to get excited about.*|PS4, XB1, PC
**Atomix** - [Claudio Quiroz](http://opencritic.com/critic/3349/claudio-quiroz) - *Spanish*|91 ~ [91 / 100](http://atomix.vg/review-wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/)|*Even and without the absence of a multiplayer mode, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a great FPS that offers a fantastic, deep and really well told story. If you love the genre you should not miss it.*|PS4
**Gadgets 360** - [Rishi Alwani](http://opencritic.com/critic/1352/rishi-alwani)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/wolfenstein-2-review-wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-review-ps4-1766796)|*Clocking in at around 15 hours, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus is a big, booming shooter with a well-paced plot, slick levels, and great gunplay.*|PS4
**GamesBeat** - [Jeff Grubb](http://opencritic.com/critic/1047/jeff-grubb)|90 ~ [90 / 100](https://venturebeat.com/2017/10/26/wolfenstein-ii-review-dear-white-people/)|*Wolfenstein II shines whenever you can feel how resistant the people of the United States are to the idea of overthrowing their new emperor. That is effective both dramatically and as a commentary on our current politics. Machine also brought the most amazing characters, quality storytelling, and well-paced gameplay to The New Colossus. You'll want to spend time with these people and discover their fate — sometimes that will your heart and sometimes that will break it. But you'll always feel something.*|
**Twinfinite** - [Tom Hopkins](http://opencritic.com/critic/2535/tom-hopkins)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5](http://twinfinite.net/2017/10/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-review/)|*Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a fluid, brutal, and challenging first-person shooter and one that is insane and over-the-top from start to finish, but it is the unique cast of characters and the story they’re a part of that shines. B.J and his crew of revolutionaries add heart and humor to the otherwise bleak world and help create some of the most memorable moments in single-player focused games this year. Machine Games has built on what made The New Order great to produce one of this generation’s finest shooters.*|PC
**USgamer** - [Caty McCarthy](http://opencritic.com/critic/2089/caty-mccarthy)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-review)|*Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus builds on the first game, making for another superb linear first-person shooter campaign. It's an empowering journey that BJ goes on—rising from his near death experience from The New Order to be stronger than ever, befriending others who are just as tough and ready to take back what the Nazis stole from them: their country.*|PS4
**Polygon** - [Ben Kuchera](http://opencritic.com/critic/1500/ben-kuchera)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/26/16551274/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-review)|*And that's the strength of this sequel. It balances a steady stream of suffering and hurt with exuberant humanity. It deals with our darkest impulses and our best, and plays them both up to a ridiculous degree. There's nothing subtle about Wolfenstein 2, but it's all affecting in a way that makes the game feel special and coherent. There are moments in the game that made my heart swell, while others were so grisly I had to look away.*|PS4

**Easy Allies** - [Ben Moore](http://opencritic.com/critic/1436/ben-moore)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jPnTJsfryQ)|*Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a snarling beast of a game. Both its action and story feel like riding a raging bull - it’s exhilarating yet terrifying. But that's also the point. New Colossus knows how to elicit so much emotion from the player because it absolutely refuses to back down in any sense. It knows exactly what it wants to say and what it wants the player to overcome, leaving an impression that won't soon be forgotten.*|PS4
**Press Start** - [James Mitchell](http://opencritic.com/critic/3659/james-mitchell)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2017/10/29/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-review-a-story-worth-telling/)|*Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus has a better idea of what it wants to be when compared to The New Order, and feels like a slightly better game because of it. The action is solid, the set pieces are memorable, and the visuals are a delight. And yet, the stand out here is the story and writing. The New Colossus humanises B.J. Blazkowicz and his comrades in a way I’d never expect and is easily a game worth playing because of it. An amazing, unique shooter that does its own thing without compromise.*|PS4
**Worth Playing** - [Will Borger](http://opencritic.com/critic/1205/will-borger)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-review)|*Strong writing, excellent performances, good gameplay, and a surprising relevance to current events combine to make Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus an old school, Nazi-killin' good time.*|PC

The violence might be a bit too much for some and its take on difficult topics such as prejudice and racism might make some folks uncomfortable. At a time when loot boxes and microtransactions are increasingly intruding into the industry, however, The New Colossus proves that developers don’t have to sell their souls to create a compelling game.*|XB1

**TrustedReviews** - [Matt Kamen](http://opencritic.com/critic/118/matt-kamen)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus)|*A far deeper game than its B-movie stylings would imply at a glance, Wolfenstein II also delights with its fast-paced, creative first-person warfare. Its tongue-in-cheek social commentary is heavy-handed, but there are few other games where mowing down the bad guys feels so cathartic or warranted. The New Colossus also pulls off the rare trick of being a sequel that more than lives up to the standard set by its predecessor, making this a real treat for returning players. Not to be missed.*|

With a dynamic protagonist and amazing characters, this is an entry in the foundation of what modern shooters, if not narrative games in general, can be. The mechanics are as stellar as the guns are loud, and it'll leave the player itching for more even when it's over.*|PS4
**Xbox Achievements** - [Dan Webb](http://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb)|88 ~ [88 / 100](http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus/review/)|*Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a stellar follow-up to MachineGames' 2014 reboot of the franchise, one with super-satisfying combat and a wacky, engaging story. Sure, it might go a little too far at times, but you'll have a blast with The New Colossus from start to finish, that's a promise.*|XB1

**GameSpace** - [Chris Saxon](http://opencritic.com/critic/4487/chris-saxon)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](https://www.gamespace.com/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus/review/)|*Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a great game.  If you're a fan of the series, this is a great addition to the family.  If you've never played the rebooted series before, I would recommend starting with Wolfenstein: The New Order, if you don't you won't be able to follow the story very well at all.  While Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus has its flaws, I think it's a definite buy.*|PC

It's more of the same, but there are more weapons, more tools, and more Nazis to kill. In some ways, it's slightly disappointing in that the mechanics aren't more creative to go with the excesses in the plot, but a safe sequel isn't a bad thing. If you enjoyed The New Order or its spin-off The Old Blood, you'll enjoy Wolfenstein II. It hits all the right marks of the original, and any flaws are minor and don't detract from the all-important task of blowing up Nazis. Sometimes, that's all a game needs to be.*|PS4

**COGconnected** - [Nicholas Plouffe](http://opencritic.com/critic/803/nicholas-plouffe)|85 ~ [85 / 100](http://opencritic.com/critic/803/nicholas-plouffe)|*It’s hard to believe that both The New Order and The Old Blood have been topped, but MachineGames has done it again with The New Colossus. While paying full price for a AAA game these days isn’t justifiable to plenty of people, this bloody shooter and likely whatever DLC comes out for it warrants every penny. If you’ve enjoyed the recent revival of single-player shooters, then Wolfenstein II should be next on your list. Mercilessly mowing down Nazis has never felt so satisfying.*|PS4
**Wccftech** - [Chris Wray](http://opencritic.com/critic/1264/chris-wray)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](https://wccftech.com/review/wolfenstein-ii-new-colossus/)|*Wolfenstein: The New Colossus subverts the old-school shooter tradition by featuring an incredible cast of characters with varied personalities in a world that makes you want to explore more and more of the society it features. The gameplay is very engaging, though can sometimes outstay its welcome at parts with a mixture of levels that range from the extremely interesting to dull and repetitive. Whatever its flaws, Wolfenstein is a great game that's well worth playing and will keep you coming back for more as you purge the US of Nazis.*|PC

Sure, the story can be a little all over the place, but that's the cost of taking the franchise in a little more in-depth direction. The New Colossus firmly establishes the alternate universe that we were introduced to in The New Order and is an excellent foundation for future entries in the series.*|XB1
**Attack of the Fanboy** - [William Schwartz](http://opencritic.com/critic/596/william-schwartz)|80 ~ [4 / 5 stars](https://aotf.com/reviews/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-review/)|*We've already seen that Machine Games can craft a great playing shooter, but with Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus they've also got a more interesting and varied story to tell this time around.*|XB1

It’s an unflinching experience that feels as if it was crafted by the only group of creators that could have delivered it. I may have come to expect greatness from the Wolfenstein name once more, but I wasn’t exactly expecting New Colossus to be quite as good as it is.*|PS4
**EGM** - [Michael Goroff](http://opencritic.com/critic/4103/michael-goroff)|80 ~ [8 / 10](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-review/)|*Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus' story and imaginative level design carry the burden of its quality on their shoulders, but they're backed up by solid shooter mechanics and really cool guns. While the experience as a whole might be inconsistent and sometimes frustrating, it's an experience worth having. After all, you get to blow up a bunch of Nazis. Also, did we mention the guns were really cool?*|PS4
**GameMAG** - [xtr](http://opencritic.com/outlet/459/gamemag) - *Russian*|80 ~ [8 / 10](http://opencritic.com/outlet/459/gamemag)|*Despite a number of shortcomings, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus surprised us with interesting stylization of the story about alternative reality, brutal action, powerful weapons and beautiful graphics. A weak finale and the absence of memorable bosses can upset someone, but in the end The New Colossus is still one of the best shooters of 2017.*|PS4
**Destructoid** - [Chris Moyse](http://opencritic.com/critic/4258/chris-moyse)|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-469807.phtml)|*Part political commentary, part comic-book farce, completely bat**** insane, and as primal as an FPS title can be, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is certainly recommended. It has a great cast, stunning visuals, breathless combat, and unforgettable story moments.*|PS4
**TheSixthAxis** - [Aran Suddi](http://opencritic.com/critic/308/aran-suddi)|80 ~ [8 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/30/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-review/)|*Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a great follow up to The New Order, though it isn’t necessarily that much better. The gameplay presents a solid first person shooter while the narrative gives us a protagonist who bears scars of battle outside and in. There are some issues when it comes to how difficult the game can get at times, but fans of first person shooters and compact single player titles should definitely give Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus a shot.*|PS4
**TechRaptor** - [Alex Santa Maria](http://opencritic.com/critic/1994/alex-santa-maria)|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://techraptor.net/content/wolfenstein-ii-new-colossus-review)|*Wolfenstein II's combat is as intense as ever, and MachineGames can craft FPS story beats like few others, but something just feels askew about this sequel. Like a follow-up to a Hollywood blockbuster, everything is a little looser and the game suffers for it.*|PC
**New Game Network** - [Tim Reid](http://opencritic.com/critic/2655/tim-reid)|80 ~ [80 / 100](http://www.newgamenetwork.com/article/1804/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-review/)|*Even though the most memorable moments in Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus don't involve much in the way of player input, it remains a satisfying story-driven shooter that that eschews major gameplay updates in favor of a greater focus on its bold storytelling and characters.*|PC
**ZTGD** - [Drew Leachman](http://opencritic.com/critic/1134/drew-leachman)|80 ~ [8 / 10](http://www.ztgd.com/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/review/)|*In the end, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus is a fun first person shooter with some issues here and there that was just enough to get on my nerves. It doesn’t shy away from the hard subjects, in both the story and the gameplay, and I think that anyone who enjoys a good FPS should pick this one up. It’s well worth the time and money even with the issues it has.*|XB1
**GameSpew** - [Richard Seagrave](http://opencritic.com/critic/2754/richard-seagrave)|80 ~ [80 / 100](https://www.gamespew.com/2017/11/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-review/)|*Bigger, bolder and somehow a hell of a lot more outlandish than The New Order, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus’ imperfections do little to hold the game back from being one of the most compelling single player games of the year. Killing Nazis has rarely been any more fun, and there’s a whole army of them for you to dispose of as you please when you’re not starring slack-jawed at some of the most over-the-top cutscenes ever created.*|XB1

**M3** - [Carl Brännström](http://opencritic.com/critic/4581/carl-br-nnstr-m) - *Swedish*|70 ~ [7 / 10](https://m3.idg.se/2.1022/1.686413/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus)|*Brutal, bloody and oneliner heavy: Nazi-killing machine BJ Blazkowicz is back in another action packed, yet oddly gripping adventure. It might not be as good as the previous game, but it sure is entertaining.*|PC
**Cubed3** - [Ofisil](http://opencritic.com/critic/1544/ofisil)|60 ~ [6 / 10](http://www.cubed3.com/review/4325/1/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-pc.html)|*Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus takes The New Order and multiplies everything tenfold (especially the silliness and the amount of cut-scenes) when it should just take the original and carefully build upon its foundation, smoothing its rough edges and offering the very best Wolfenstein game ever. The result is a FPS that's fun, but also one that doesn't really know what it wants to be.*|PC

**AngryCentaurGaming** - Jeremy Penter - [Wait For Sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JZfoz7UVr0)

>""A serviceable game with unique ideas but far too many technological issues,

--------------

**Attack of the Fanboy** - William Schwartz - [2.5 / 5 stars](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-review/)

>Technical issues aside Kingdom Come: Deliverance is at best an ambitious game. There are flashes of brilliance in the implementation of Warhorse Studios' unique systems of the game, as it truly does have interestingly deep survival and progression elements.  Though when you do take into account the technical issues it becomes a frustrating experience in which the bad completely outweighs the good.

--------------

**Cubed3** - Ofisil - [7 / 10](http://www.cubed3.com/review/4613/1/kingdom-come-deliverance-pc.html)

>As realistic, historically accurate, unrelenting, casual-unfriendly, open-word RPG games go, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is probably the best on offer right now. It's only worthy of the bronze medal, though, as it's very far from perfect, and the amount of flaws at hand mean that this is quite the dirty kind of bronze medal.

--------------

**Expansive** - Ray Willmott - [6.5 / 10.0](http://expansivedlc.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-review/)

>Kingdom Come: Deliverance looks, sounds and acts the part but is inherently flawed in so many different ways that it’s very hard to pay attention to its good traits long enough to not to be distracted by the bad.

--------------

**Game Revolution** - Jason Faulkner - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/368221-kingdom-come-deliverance-review-hardcore-henry)

>If you want a bug-free experience, don't get Kingdom Come. If you want an excellent, open-world RPG that feels like a hardcore version of an Elder Scrolls game, then don't hesitate.

--------------

**GamePro** - Elena Schulz - *German* - [76 / 100](http://www.gamepro.de/artikel/kingdom-come-deliverance-gespaltenes-koenigreich,3325976.html)

>Kingdom Come is complex and difficult to access. However, if you get involved in it, you will experience an incredibly coherent RPG world.

**GameSpace** - Jatobi - [8 / 10.0](https://www.gamespace.com/featured/kingdom-come-deliverance-review/)

>It’s not just about completing the story, it’s about longevity.  How long will this game keep my attention?  I can tell you that 30 hours into the game I’m still finding new things and still learning the whole way.

**GameSpew** - Richard Seagrave - [90%](https://www.gamespew.com/2018/02/kingdom-come-deliverance-review/)

**GameWatcher** - Marcello Perricone - [8 / 10.0](http://www.gamewatcher.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-review/12970)

>Kingdom Come is a walking simulator merged with an RPG that takes you down a Wikipedia black hole. Accepting its historicity and deciphering its cerebral game systems is like completing a religious rite.

--------------

**GamingTrend** - Ron Burke - [No Verdict](http://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-review-in-progress/)

>I've had a lot to say for a game I'm not ready to pass judgement on quite yet, but it's safe to say that I'm absolutely blown away by what Warhorse has put together.

--------------

**GBAtemp** - Thomas Hugh - [5.5 / 10.0](http://gbatemp.net/review/kingdom-come-deliverance.727/)

>From what I did play of Kingdom Come: Deliverance has left me with mixed feelings. I enjoyed the story and wanted to see if Henry became a great Knight and avenged his family, but at the same time, I found myself battling against the game's systems every time it gave me control. Warhorse Studios have created an ambitious world with Kingdom Come: Deliverance, unfortunately, it didn't deliver for me.

--------------

**Hardcore Gamer** - Jordan Helm - [3.5 / 5.0](https://www.hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=289947)

>Had the initial forty-to-fifty hour campaign not have delivered the level of bugs and problems present in the current build, you'd easily be looking at potentially one of the year's best all-round experiences in an RPG and an essential for everyone no matter your affiliation with the genre.

--------------

**IGN Italy** - Marco Esposto - *Italian* - [7.5 / 10.0](http://it.ign.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-pc/136732/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-la-recensione)

>Great story and medieval atmosphere, but with some technical problems, like low frame-rate, graphic pop-ups and improvable artificial intelligence.

--------------

**PCGamesN** - Robert Zak - [No Verdict](http://www.pcgamesn.com/kingdom-come-deliverance/kingdom-come-deliverance-pc-review)

>This is an ambitious game, polished to perfection when it comes to atmosphere, but rough and cumbersome in many of its moment-to-moment interactions.

--------------

**PCWorld** - Hayden Dingman - [No Verdict](http://www.pcworld.com/article/3254197/gaming/kingdom-come-deliverance-review.html)

>For now, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is decidedly niche, and all the better for it.

--------------

**Press Start** - James Mitchell - [6 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/pc-reviews/2018/02/13/kingdom-come-deliverance-review-ambitious-adventure/)

>Kingdom Come: Deliverance has clearly had a lot of love and effort put into it, but it's unapologetically appealing to a very specific niche. The authenticity and realism is like no other, and that niche is bound to be pulled into its world for hours on end. Unfortunately, this dedication to realism is ironically what really stopped me from immersing myself into the well realised world of Bohemia, which is a huge shame.

--------------

**PS Site** - Kacper Mądry - *Polish* - [5 / 10.0](http://www.pssite.com/recenzje/2861/recenzja-kingdom-come-deliverance-ps4.html)

>Kingdom Come: Deliverance could be a great game. Sadly, bugs and bad optimization made it impossible to reach that level of quality.

--------------

**Rock, Paper, Shotgun** - Edwin Evans-Thirlwell - [No Verdict](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/02/13/kingdom-come-deliverance-review/)

>The measure of an open world is ultimately not the story it tells but whether you're happy to kill time within it, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance offers plenty of ways to do that, even if a lot of them will, in fact, get you slaughtered.

--------------

**The Games Machine** - Mario Baccigalupi - *Italian* - [8 / 10.0](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/kingdom-come-deliverance/kingdom-come-deliverance-recensione/)

>It's almost impossible not to compare Kingdom Come: Deliverance with the Witcher series: there's absolutely no fantasy in the Warhorse production, but it boasts a strong character, an enormous quantity of content, choices that matter, and an adult and mature storyline. You can't expect the same visual quality or a comparable level of polish (pun intended), but the battles are like nothing you've ever seen, and the depth of the simulation really drags the player into a beautiful medieval novel.

--------------

**TheSixthAxis** - Dave Irwin - [4 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/kingdom-come-deliverance-review/)

>If Kingdom Come: Deliverance has a ton of bug fixing to improve the performance drastically, it could be a hidden gem. It's clear that the game, despite its grand ambitions, was simply not ready for public consumption. Shimmers of brilliance are there and had it seen more time in the oven, or set its ambitions at a more reasonable level, it could have been brilliant and scored significantly higher as a result. Alas, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is another cautionary tale rather than a trend setter.

--------------

**Windows Central** - Rich Edmonds - [3 / 5 stars](http://www.windowscentral.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-pc-review)

>Kingdom Come: Deliverance's large open world is packed full of things to do in a setting many can relate to. It's by no means perfect, which is unfortunately down to the sheer scope of the project for such a small team of developers.

>Microsoft Flight Simulator is a massive generational leap from its predecessor, and every time I play the game I’m blown away by just how good it looks. From a completely simulated physics system with wind, weather and more, to highly detailed aircraft and airports, it’s truly something worth checking out.

>If you are an experienced pilot and already have X-Plane with premium paid content, you won't upgrade to Microsoft Flight Simulator. Well, not right away. Because if we can find problems with Asobo's baby, none of them is insoluble and will undoubtedly see improvements to strive even more towards perfection. As it stands, Flight Simulator is already a benchmark platform that will undoubtedly establish itself as the civil flight simulation of the decade. Checkmate.

>Microsoft Flight Simulator is a game that you have to play to understand just how incredible of an experience it is. It's an incomparable adventure that consistently surprises and delights. The game provides you with all the tools necessary to conquer the unthinkable task of flying the plane. Asobo has laid an incredible platform that will provide hours upon hours of joy for both casual gamers and flight experts alike, and it's only upwards from here.

>Flight Simulator at launch is only the beginning, as it’s set to be a game that evolves and grows over time rather than being a static product. If this was all the game would be, it’s great as-is. No matter whether you buy it, or download it via Game Pass, you’re getting the best flight simulator to-date. Microsoft Flight Simulator soars to new heights, and has easily been worth the the fourteen year wait.

>Impressive use of proprietary Microsoft's maps and AI technologies aside, Flight Simulator is outstanding for the sheer amount of freedom we are given and how far it pushes our spirit of exploration. Sim fans will have a lot to chew on, and newcomers will love the ""simcade"" feeling offered by the customizable assist system. It's also on Xbox Game Pass, so go get it.

>Microsoft Flight Simulator is an absolutely wonderful gameplay experience. There is just something undeniably magical about flying around and seeing sights that you may have only read about in a book or seen online. With so many of us still in quarantine and self-isolation, there has never been a more perfect time for this level of escapism.

>Microsoft Flight Simulator is a triumphantly ambitious venture which pushes the boundaries of photorealism in the gaming medium. It requires a lot of horsepower and the support of Azure technology to accomplish such a feat, but these barriers are washed away when you're staring down at endless cities and thick jungles from thousands of feet in the air. It's breathtaking, and I hope it brings such simulators further into the mainstream.

>It’s a technical achievement and an excellent training aid, but it’s also a brilliant piece of escapism, transcending its purpose as a tool to become something far more widely enjoyable – and I can’t recommend it enough.

>This is not a particularly forgiving game, and for folks out there that want to see just how good it can look on your screen at home, you may find yourself unable to penetrate the heart of the simulation that lies under this beautifully crafted fuselage. And that’s okay – not every game can be made for every player out there.
>
>There’s an enormous amount of enjoyment to be had in just exploring, and that speaks to me in a way not a lot of games have over the years. Cruising at 30,000 feet with the hum of the engine, the rattle of turbulence and the world below me, available in a way it never has been is absolutely worth sending a postcard home about.

**Kotaku Australia** - Alex Walker - [Unscored](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2020/08/microsoft-flight-simulator-review-kotaku-australia/)

>Quietly soaring through the clouds, streaming in the remnants of global air traffic going about their business, is wonderfully relaxing. And being able to smoothly access that from my home, and to be able to smoothly load up such an experience as a release from the ails of the world, is an incredible showcase for the next generation of games.

|**AngryCentaurGaming** \- [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter)|Wait for Sale \~ [Wait for Sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOu4MevswY4)|*Despite the issues with the combat, I would say, for me, this is a 'Wait for a sale' maybe for 50% off, and many are probably gonna say wait for a deep, deep sale. If you're a fan of Darksiders games, make no mistake there's fanservice here, there's tons of it, and some tried and trued Darksiders action, but as a fan, you might also notice the change in the game design mixed with the occasional lackluster level design as well, which honestly, especially after recently playing the remastered editions, leaves a bit to be desired. I think for many, the situation is gonna split down the middle: those who loved the intricate design of the past games dungeons and locations, and those who wanted a more open environment. At times, it does have freakishly good combat, and at times, it is actually interesting to explore, and at times, there's a puzzle or two that were at least slightly fun. Of course, there are those technical issues that they need to shore up.*||

|**Rock, Paper, Shotgun** \- [R0B0D4D](https://opencritic.com/outlet/270/rock-paper-shotgun)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/11/26/darksiders-3-review/)|*It’s a slight affair all-told, the character/weapon upgrade system drably functional, much of the combat and environments routine, the plot generously described as forgettable. Often, it fully gets away with not being the beneficiary of big, fat THQbucks, as its predecessors enjoyed, but sometimes its (presumably) slightly more humble THQ Nordic budget is more apparent.*|PC|
|**Polygon** \- [Ryan Gilliam](https://opencritic.com/critic/5319/ryan-gilliam)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/11/26/18103429/darksiders-3-review-pc-ps4-xbox-one)|*Darksiders 3 is a nostalgic trip, reminding me of games I loved when I was younger. It never does anything spectacular, nor does it offer many new ideas. Instead, it exists as an earnest reminder of how games played eight years ago, and that’s enough for me.*|PC|
|**Jimpressions** \- [Jim Fucking Sterling, Son](https://opencritic.com/critic/594/jim-sterling)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV4NBgofQh0)|*Darksiders is my thing; I adore it. But this... I just wish it didn't exist. It's a stain on the series. One of the most backwards sequels I've ever seen. Darksiders III is a pale, tiny, twisted shadow of the series.*||
|**Niche Gamer** \- [Sophia Narwitz](https://opencritic.com/critic/5680/sophia-narwitz)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://nichegamer.com/reviews/darksiders-iii-review/)|*There are a few qualms here and there, like its technical issues, and at the end of the day I wish it offered more enemy variety, but even when considering those problems, the game is a blast.*|PS4|
|**God is a Geek** \- [Gary Bailey](https://opencritic.com/critic/1939/gary-bailey)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/darksiders-3-review/)|*Darksiders III is a stunning achievement, bringing the once-dead series back to life with aplomb.*|PC|
|**Areajugones** \- [Ronald Goncalves](https://opencritic.com/critic/3416/ronald-goncalves) \- *Spanish*|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://areajugones.sport.es/darksiders-iii-3/analisis/)|*Once again, the Horsemen offer us a masterpiece. Darksiders III, even with all the fear and skepticism behind the game, has managed to become a superb hack ‘n' slash. The personal journey of Fury against the Seven Deadly Sins is simply amazing, and everything is set towards the future for Strife to come and end this awesome epic.*||
|**Gadgets 360** \- [Rishi Alwani](https://opencritic.com/critic/1352/rishi-alwani)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/darksiders-3-pc-review-1953532)|*All in all, Darksiders 3 is a stunning return to a franchise that we'd love to see more of. The stellar game world, intriguing story, and slick gameplay make it one worth checking out even if you're not a fan of the series. It's a surprise Darksiders 3 exists. And a welcome one at that.*|PC|
|**The Games Machine** \- [Danilo Dellafrana](https://opencritic.com/critic/3695/danilo-dellafrana) \- *Italian*|87 \~ [8.7 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/darksiders-iii/darksiders-iii-recensione-pc-ps4-xbox-one/)|*Darksiders III is a nice game, as well as a perfect sequel to a series that seemed lost in the maelstrom generated by THQ's bankruptcy. Fury might not have the charisma of the previous knigtht, War and Death, but overall the adventure boasts a very good pace, alternating discreetly challenging fights and satisfying puzzles. Definitely recommended.*|PC|
|**GaminGuardian** \- [Alberto Morales Palencia](https://opencritic.com/critic/4927/alberto-morales-palencia) \- *Spanish*|85 \~ [8.5 / 10](https://gaminguardian.com/analisis-darksiders-iii/)|*Darksiders III is a breath of fresh air in the Darksiders franchise. The game bet on a more defiant combat and a interconnected world, similar to dark souls series, and the result is very well.*|PC|
|**Hobby Consolas** \- [Martín Amechazurra Falagán](https://opencritic.com/critic/4299/mart-n-amechazurra-falag-n) \- *Spanish*|85 \~ [85 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-darksiders-3-regreso-saga-ps4-xbox-one-pc-335321)|*Darksiders 3 goes back to its Hack and Slash roots with some really engaging combat, challenging enemies, and a world that offers some great variety in its levels, but the course of the adventure ends up being somewhat linear.*|PC|
|**Spaziogames** \- [Valthiel](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames) \- *Italian*|85 \~ [8.5 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/darksiders-3-recensione-seven-deadly-sins/)|*Darksiders 3 is the best entry in the series. This new chapter has a solid game structure and represents all the best that you can expect from a modern action-adventure game.*|PC|
|**Shacknews** \- [Larryn Bell](https://opencritic.com/critic/5770/larryn-bell)|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/108691/darksiders-3-review-hell-hath-fury)|*Darksiders 3 does seem a bit lacking when compared to its series brethren, at least for those who come in with high expectations. Darksiders 3 is recognizably a Darksiders game. However, the game would have benefited from more risk-taking in areas where it chose to play it safe. Nevertheless, Fury’s story is one worth experiencing, especially for long-time fans who are anxious to see how the next chapter of the four horsemen unfurls.*|PC|
|**Windows Central** \- [Brendan Lowry](https://opencritic.com/critic/4652/brendan-lowry)|80 \~ [4 / 5 stars](https://www.windowscentral.com/darksiders-iii-review-embrace-your-inner-fury-engaging-action-rpg)|*Despite the issues that drag down Darksiders III, it's still an excellent hack-and-slash action RPG that is more than worth the purchase.*|PC|
|**Game Informer** \- [Kyle Hilliard](https://opencritic.com/critic/1040/kyle-hilliard)|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/darksiders-iii/a-quality-experience-from-another-age)|*What Darksiders III lacks in production values, it makes up for with good design. The smaller, personal elements of the story are interesting, but the larger picture is confusing*|PC|
|**Gamerheadquarters** \- [Jason Stettner](https://opencritic.com/critic/2141/jason-stettner)|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://articles.gamerheadquarters.com/darksiders-3-review.html)|*Darksiders 3 is a solid next entry in the series with Fury being a strong lead providing charm and rage fueled will.*|XB1|
|**Destructoid** \- [Chris Carter](https://opencritic.com/critic/431/chris-carter)|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-darksiders-iii-531302.phtml)|*Most of my complaints are related to the RPG bits which are not the main focus of Darksiders III. It remains an action-fueled project and that's an angle it does well, reigning in some of the out-of-hand ideas from its predecessor. With all of the efforts to resurrect this once dead and buried series I hope there's a chance to wrap it all up with Strife: I want to see this story through until the end, blemishes and all.*|PS4|
|**GamingBolt** \- [Will Borger](https://opencritic.com/critic/1205/will-borger)|80 \~ [8 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/darksiders-iii-review-the-sound-and-the-fury)|*DarkSiders III marries the best parts of DarkSiders will new mechanics, a fun world to explore, enjoyable characters and story, and an engaging combat system.*|PC|
|**Digitally Downloaded** \- [Matt Sainsbury](https://opencritic.com/critic/1604/matt-sainsbury)|80 \~ [4 / 5 stars](https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2018/11/review-darksiders-iii-sony-playstation-4.html)|*Darksiders III is a fine return for a series that fans were hoping against hope to see again.*|PS4|
|**GamingLyf** \- Charles Tyldsley|80 \~ [4 / 5 stars](https://gaminglyf.com/reviews/2018-11-26-darksiders-iii-review/)|*Darksiders 3 shifts the series in a new Souls-like direction. Whilst not all of the new elements are a home-run, the game's combat is fantastic throughout. Despite some frustrating difficulty spikes and performance issues here and there, the game still manages to provide a whole lot of fun from start to finish. In an era of microtransaction riddled experiences, Darksiders 3 feels like a breath of fresh air.*||
|**Softpedia** \- [Andrei Dobra](https://opencritic.com/critic/607/andrei-dobra)|75 \~ [7.5 / 10](https://www.softpedia.com/reviews/games/playstation-4/darksiders-iii-review-523964.shtml)|*The performance issues on the PS4 and the iffy platforming make the game fall short of reaching the same status as its past entries. All these things may be fixed with future updates but, at least for now, the title can only be recommended to hardcore fans and those looking for a challenge.*|PS4|
|**PlayStation Universe** \- [Garri Bagdasarov](https://opencritic.com/critic/840/garri-bagdasarov)|75 \~ [7.5 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/ps4-darksiders-3/)|*Darksiders 3 does a lot right but suffers from some technical issues that hold it back from greatness. Nevertheless, the fantastic exploration, great character designs, fun combat, and excellent writing help it outshine some of its faults. Fans will definitely find that Gunfire Games have done a great job keeping the essence of the franchise alive.*|PS4|
|**GamingTrend** \- [Ron Burke](https://opencritic.com/critic/483/ron-burke)|75 \~ [7.5 / 10](http://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/fury-fun-and-occasional-frustration-darksiders-iii-review/)|*With a more heavy focus on action, Darksiders III is a return to the roots of the franchise, and away from the RPG elements of its predecessor. Whether that appeals to you or not, there’s more than enough fantastic story elements to bring any fan back to see how Fury’s story ties to her Four Horseman brethren. Let’s just hope Gunfire Games can apply one last coat of polish over the controls and checkpoint system to elevate this game to where it belongs.*|PC|
|**Merlin'in Kazanı** \- [Korhan Onuk](https://opencritic.com/critic/5769/korhan-onuk) \- *Turkish*|74 \~ [74 / 100](https://www.merlininkazani.com/Darksiders_3-oyun_inceleme-104692p1.html)|Darksiders 3 is more difficult than previous games. Terrible checkpoint system and long loading times makes game troublesome. But soundtracks, combat system and bosses are great. You should give it a try.||
|**TechRaptor** \- [Dan Hodges](https://opencritic.com/critic/5506/dan-hodges)|70 \~ [7 / 10](https://techraptor.net/content/darksiders-3-review-threes-company)|*Darksiders 3 makes up its lack of depth in satisfying combat and memorable boss fights, making for a solid third entry in the series.*|PC|
|**WellPlayed** \- [Ash Wayling](https://opencritic.com/critic/2456/ash-wayling)|70 \~ [7 / 10](https://www.well-played.com.au/darksiders-iii-review/)|*Darksiders III does feel like a game that wished it was released many years ago, with a slew of older-style design elements that sit alongside more modern attitudes towards combat and story*|PS4, PC|
|**PC Invasion** \- [Andrew Farrell](https://opencritic.com/critic/5533/andrew-farrell)|70 \~ [3.5 / 5 stars](https://www.pcinvasion.com/review/darksiders-iii-review-a-soulsy-metroidvania/)|*Overall, I honestly loved Darksiders III in spite of its shortcomings. It does have some serious problems, but the world and level designs as a whole save it in my eyes. Taken on its Metroidvania merits, it absolutely nails what makes the genre one of my favorites.*|PC|
|**GamesRadar+** \- [Sam Prell](https://opencritic.com/critic/653/sam-prell)|70 \~ [3.5 / 5 stars](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/darksiders-3-review/)|*Darksiders 3 feels like coming home for fans, and combat is a blast - but it can be hard to appreciate the good when dealing with a laundry list of technical stumbles.*|PS4|
|**Press Start** \- [James Mitchell](https://opencritic.com/critic/3659/james-mitchell)|70 \~ [7 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2018/11/26/darksiders-iii-review-hell-hath-no-fury/)|*Darksiders III is the follow-up that fans have been waiting for, no doubt, but this is both its greatest strength and weakness. On one hand, it feels just like the previous two games albeit with a much better combat system and some fantastic encounters. On the other, much like Darksiders II, it's trying too many things at once and comes off as having an identity crisis. Without a doubt, though, Darksiders III is easily better than Darksiders II, and that's worth celebrating.*|PS4|
|**RPG Site** \- [Bryan Vitale](https://opencritic.com/critic/2832/bryan-vitale)|70 \~ [7 / 10](http://www.rpgsite.net/review/8035-darksiders-iii-review)|*Darksiders III falls short of the games it's imitating, but it is still an engaging experience in its own right.*|PC|
|**TheSixthAxis** \- [Thomas Hughes](https://opencritic.com/critic/3094/thomas-hughes)|70 \~ [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/26/darksiders-iii-review/)|*Darksiders III, while more limited in scope than its predecessor, provides a tighter, more deliberate experience that elaborates on the lore we've seen so far. The smaller world of Darksiders 3 may disappoint some fans of the previous game, but this feels like a reboot of the series. Poor PC performance, a lack of side-objectives and some unimaginative world-design point to a game with ambitions bigger than its budget, but Darksiders II is a fun and challenging experience that kept me engaged across the length of its story.*|PC|
|**Worth Playing** \- [Cody Medellin](https://opencritic.com/critic/4182/cody-medellin)|70 \~ [7 / 10](http://worthplaying.com/article/2018/11/26/reviews/111887/)|*There is no doubt that Darksiders III is a flawed product, but series fans who are accepting of the changes will find it to be a good entry in the series. The camera is a source of constant frustration since it causes a number of issues where you get sucker-punched in combat while you're still relatively weak. With that said, the combat becomes enjoyable once you come to grips with the Dark Souls-style system and the more open level design takes the sting out of having to fight through closed spaces for most of the game. One has to wonder how different the possible fourth game could be.*|PC|
|**GameMAG** \- [GameMAG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/459/gamemag) \- *Russian*|70 \~ [7 / 10](https://gamemag.ru/reviews/darksiders-iii)|*Darksiders III is a ""hello from the past"" with an interesting story, controversial design decisions, challenging and not always obvious puzzles, and a clearly limited budget. Blurry graphics and optimization problems spoil the impression, but if you'll stay with the game for a first few hours of gameplay, then Darksiders 3 will offer you a cool character, epic battles with beautiful bosses, good puzzles and a deep world exploration. In this case, the game will still be able to keep your attention until the very end.*|PS4|
|**IGN** \- [Daemon Hatfield](https://opencritic.com/critic/228/daemon-hatfield)|70 \~ [7 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/26/darksiders-iii-review)|*The straightforward simplicity of* *Darksiders III* *is a refreshing change of pace after exploring so many dense open-world games. That simplicity doesn’t refer to the combat or boss battles, though, which are complex and almost startlingly unforgiving. Its throwback philosophy is comfort food for action gamers of a certain age, but it would’ve been nice to see the third game in the series introduce some new concepts to relaunch Darksiders in the modern age.*|PS4. XB1, PC|
|**The Digital Fix** \- [Stephen Dalton](https://opencritic.com/critic/4545/stephen-hudson)|70 \~ [7 / 10](https://www.thedigitalfix.com/gaming/content/11799/darksiders-iii/)|*Darksiders III* *isn’t a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s hardly the upgrade many fans were anticipating. Thankfully, Fury is easily the most compelling and intriguing of the Horsemen, and the hunt for the Seven Deadly Sins was, for the most part, enjoyable thanks to a solid script, excellent voice acting and unique character designs. Sadly though, dull visuals, technical glitches and a brutal difficulty mean* *Darksiders III* *is a solid, if unspectacular entry into the* *Darksiders* *series.*|PS4|
|**PC Gamer** \- [Samuel Horti](https://opencritic.com/critic/1099/samuel-horti)|62 \~ [62 / 100](https://www.pcgamer.com/darksiders-3-review/)|*With less loot to grab, simplified platforming and easy puzzles, Darksiders 3 leans harder on its combat than previous games. And while Fury packs a punch, the wonky camera makes fights more frustrating that they should be. It doesn’t condemn Darksiders to oblivion, but it’s the lowlight of the series so far.* |PC|
|**Critical Hit** \- [Darryn Bonthuys](https://opencritic.com/critic/1229/darryn-bonthuys)|60 \~ [6 / 10](https://www.criticalhit.net/gaming/darksiders-iii-review-apocalypse-frau/)|*Beneath the mountain of bugs, shoddy design and inconsistent performance, there's a  genuinely good adventure waiting to be experienced in Darksiders III. Unfortunately, its numerous problems are more than just annoying in nature. They're quite simply…apocalyptic.*|PS4|
|**Push Square** \- [Ken Talbot](https://opencritic.com/critic/1967/ken-talbot)|60 \~ [6 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/darksiders_iii)|*Darksiders hasn't changed much since 2012. It's still a fun mishmash of genres with a great protagonist and undemanding combat systems, but it's a pity that it feels outdated compared to its genre peers and stumbles when injecting Souls-like sensibilities.*|PS4|
|**Daily Mirror** \- [JC Suttun](https://opencritic.com/critic/4401/jc-suttun)|60 \~ [3 / 5 stars](https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/darksiders-3-review-sign-up-13645913)|*Darksiders 3 is for the most part a fun and well made adventure that you'll want to see through to the end. But while the different approach to combat is indeed an attempt to push the series somewhere new, in the end it leaves the whole experience feeling slightly off-balance, coming across like a watered down Dark Souls in spots when it should have had enough personality in its own right.*||
|**MS Power User** \- [Lewis White](https://opencritic.com/critic/4209/lewis-white)|60 \~ [6 / 10](https://mspoweruser.com/review-darksiders-3-is-a-diamond-in-the-rough-that-cant-hide-its-glaring-technical-shortcomings/)|*Gunfire Games have done well in providing an engaging and satisfying third entry in the Darksiders franchise. With meaty, fast combat and fantastic character designs, I want everyone to play a version of Darksiders 3 that doesn’t feel like it’s imploding. As enjoyable as it is, it can’t escape from its technical shortcomings. It’s a sinking ship but the band is still playing – at least the song sounds good.*|XB1|
|**Attack of the Fanboy** \- [William Schwartz](https://opencritic.com/critic/596/william-schwartz)|60 \~ [3 / 5 stars](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/darksiders-3)|*As the great Paul Hollywood once said, this one could’ve used a little more time in the oven. Gunfire Games has done its best, and at times, succeeds in making Darksiders 3 a worthwhile successor to the previous two entries. Combat is fun and accessible while exploration is nuanced enough to remain engaging. But there isn’t enough off the beaten path or outside of the fairly predictable story to really help this stand out. Ridiculous performance problems that I experienced only help compound a package that is enjoyable yet ultimately underwhelming.*||
|**AusGamers** \- [Kosta Andreadis](https://opencritic.com/critic/1379/kosta-andreadis)|58 \~ [5.8 / 10](http://www.ausgamers.com/reviews/read.php/3611639)|*It doesn’t become great, but there are flashes of brilliance and promise.*|PC|

As you (sufferingly) progress, things improve… but you really, really need to be dedicated to get to that point. I’d recommend* *Darksiders 3* *to die-hard fans of the franchise — and I truly mean die-hard — and no one else. It’s too painful to play for a majority of the time.*|PC|
|**VideoGamer** \- [Colm Ahern](https://opencritic.com/critic/577/colm-ahern)|50 \~ [5 / 10](http://www.videogamer.com//reviews/darksiders-3-review)|*When combat is between you and one other, Darksiders 3 can provide some decent, button-mashy fun, but the real fight is with the baffling world design and some cheap deaths.*|PC|

There are remnants of a good game here, buried within the vivacious combos of a combat style this game doesn't want to embrace. Unfortunately, it's buried far too deep to ever salvage.*|PS4|

|**Game Rant** \- [Dalton Cooper](https://opencritic.com/critic/260/dalton-cooper)|20 \~ [1 / 5](https://gamerant.com/darksiders-3-review/)|*Being a smaller game than Darksiders 2 is the least of Darksiders 3‘s problems, though. The game is a nightmare to play through, with an unlikable protagonist, a chugging frame rate, and a mountain of bugs. It’s completely and utterly broken, but even when it works (which is almost never), it amounts to nothing more than a below average hack-and-slash with some decent puzzles. When THQ went out of business, there was worry that a* *new Darksiders game* *would never be made, but after the abomination that is Darksiders 3, some fans will be wishing that the franchise stayed dead.*|PS4|

>Forza Horizon 3 delivers the ultimate car fantasy and festival experience, introduces innovative new features, and has listened to fans by returning some long missed ones. This is the Horizon game we’ve wanted, and developer Playground Games have delivered. Forza Horizon 3 is undoubtedly the ultimate celebration of cars, music, and freedom of the open road.

>How much you'll enjoy Horizon 3 depends on where you fall on the driving game spectrum. The more hardcore sim fans might find things a little too arcade-ish for their liking. Although there are circuit races on street tracks, they'll never compare to lapping Spa or the Nordschleife, and the off-road driving isn't the same test of skill that you'll get from DiRT Rally. But for fans of previous Horizon games or the Project Gotham series, this sequel will probably tick all your boxes. (A friend described it as ""Test Drive Unlimited, but done right""). This predisposes Horizon 3 to a wider and more casual gaming audience without nerfing the important Forza cornerstones—variety, content, and car options—that make a game like this worth driving so many roads for so many hours.

[CNET](http://www.cnet.com/products/forza-horizon-3/review/)
>Microsoft has struck a great balance across what different kinds of racing fans want from the core Forza games and Forza Horizon. If you want excellent track racing, stick with Forza. If you want to have the most fun possible behind the wheel of a pretend car out on the open road, Forza Horizon is a winner, and Horizon 3 is a worthy successor to the series.

>Playground Games' take on Australia falls right in line. It's not quite the leap that the franchise made from the original Horizon to Horizon 2, but it's not on cruise control, either. There's enough variation here -- from the feel of cars to the game modes to the radio stations -- that this is another excellent installment in an always-excellent series. And, since variation is a key reason for Horizon 3's success, well, Australia seems like it's probably the most perfectly appropriate setting.

>Forza Horizon 3 is an unstoppable force of adventure and fun. Throughout my hours and hours of gameplay, I explored desserts, beaches, and festive cities, demolished my fair-share of farms, and blasted Beethoven over the speaker system, all with a goofy smile on my face. This isn’t a game to be missed by Xbox One or PC players, regardless if you are new to the genre or a Motorsport pro. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to get back to the Outback.

>With Forza Horizon 3, Turn 10 and Playground Games affirm the series’ status as the driving game for everyone The new emphasis on off-road options isn’t at the expense of traditional races, thanks to the sheer volume of activities. All the while, Playground Games’ calculated kitchen-sink design philosophy and rich reward system persistently tempt you to explore beyond your comfort zone, whether it’s gifting your first Ariel Nomad buggy or reminding you that stunt races can impress thousands of fans. Enhancing your own brand might feel like a strange motivation to hit the road, but pulling off sick e-drifts on a mile-long series of curves makes the PR work worthwhile.

>Forza Horizon 3 is a very high quality video game, with a multitude of amazing features, great visuals, a stonking soundtrack, exemplary online integration, insane speed (at times) and solid handling. You won’t need to think much while you play it, but if you’re talking about places to just cut loose and enjoy the breathtaking scenery, Australia is a fine place to do it.

[IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/20/forza-horizon-3-review) - 9.5/10
>Forza Horizon 3 is a masterclass in open-world racing and bigger and better than its excellent predecessor across the board. It looks fantastic, the car selection and customisation is second to none, and the size and variety of the sprawling Australian outback is magnificent. Above all, Horizon 3 never loses sight of the fact that tearing through postcard-perfect locations should be fun, and it puts the tools in our hands to keep it that way, always. This is the racing game I’ve been waiting for, and it's officially my favourite thing on four wheels. A fair dinkum triumph, mates.

>Forza Horizon 3 is as much a driving game as a racing game. Through a superbly realized version of Australia as well as a wide variety of terrain, cars and challenges, this free-roaming car simulation offers a valuable playbox. But it also managed to muster ""cor blimey"" moments that made me feel a whooping rush of speed and liberation.

>After playing every game in the Forza series, I can say without any hesitation that this is, by far, the best Forza game to date. The open-world driving mechanics are seamless, the amount of content is vast, and the social game modes deliver the most variety the series has ever seen. While previous iterations from the Forza Horizon series were used to first introduce and fine tune the open-world mechanic, Forza Horizon 3 feels like the series grand crescendo as all of that work has lead up to the best Forza game I've ever played. I already was a big fan of the Forza series, but Forza Horizon 3 is beyond anything I could have ever imagined for the series and I can’t wait to discover more of its beautiful world.

>Forza Horizon 3 takes the winning formula from previous releases in the series and improves upon them in almost every way. The expansive roster of cars are all beautifully designed right down to the smallest detail. The setting is stunning with very few walls and boundaries to inhibit your freedom, and now you can experience all of the fun in four-player co-op with the added bonus of being able to customise almost every aspect of each race to your choosing. Quite simply, Forza Horizon 3 is the pinnacle of open-world racers available on the Xbox One.

>Bigger and better than its predecessor in every way, Forza Horizon 3 features a beautiful, incredibly diverse landscape, an impressive roster of over 350 meticulously-detailed cars, and an absolute ton of driving activities and challenges. Forza Horizon 3 is without doubt the finest arcade racer yet seen, and it looks set to become one of this generation's greatest games.

>While Horizon 3 is very much its own thing, it’s indebted to a decade’s worth of arcade racers. I’ve mentioned Burnout Paradise, but you will taste notes of Split/Second, Blur, MotorStorm, and of course, Need for Speed, the racing equivalent of Madden. Despite their excellence, most of those franchises have been abandoned, their studios shutdown or assigned to more traditional fare. Forza Horizon 3 is racing on a track without competition. It would have been easy to coast to the finish line, but Playground Studios has taken the opportunity to take a joyride. With no rush to reach the finish line, and thus no obligation to take the best route, they’re seeing what new paths they can discover. How fortunate they’ve invited us to ride along.

> It’s a game of endless freedom but also constant moral quandaries. Where you’re challenged as a parent as often as you are on the battlefield. Where you can pay tribute to Popes while torturing the innocent in your dungeons. Where you’re constantly bombarded with choices and decisions, and every single one of them means something... Crusader Kings III may begin in what we used to call the Dark Ages, but it’s a Renaissance for strategy gaming in 2020.

> It's a testament to the game's success that it is so startling to have the illusion of its reality shattered. There are some parts of human behavior that you simply can't reduce into a math equation or series of ""if, then"" statements. What Crusader Kings III does comes very, very close, so much so that I stayed up all night playing it twice in the same week. It is so easy to slip into your world, lording over a few counties, totally engrossed in the minute dramas of your court. But the real marvel is when you scroll out to see the whole world, and you see how much of it has developed without you.

> Crusader Kings III is one of those “just five more minutes” games, which hooks you in with various short term objectives and before you know it several hours have gone by. As King Malcolm, I was determined to force the Earl of Northumbria to accept my terms for peace in his aggressive war to capture Cumbria from me. Sadly, Malcolm was slain in battle outside Carlisle in 1072 (a full 20 years before he was “supposed” to die) leaving young Prince Duncan (age 12) to be the new King. Whether the young king’s reign will be as great as his father is a story for another time. Crusader Kings III is full to the brim with these stories, and each time you play a new character you can construct a new saga. It truly brings history to life in a way few other games have achieved.

> There are so many more little good things about Crusader Kings 3 that I’d like to talk about. So many strange little intricacies, and delightful, unexpected moments of satisfaction, of the kind CK2 delivered so well. And that’s the thing. Because if this game came out of nowhere, with nothing like it having graced the PC before, I would be speechless at its ingenuity. But of course, Crusader Kings 2 has been gracing our PCs, for eight years now, and it’s a bloody hard act to follow (you have to realise just how hard it is not to swerve into a concluding metaphor about royal succession here. Rest assured, I’m not going to do it).

>Crusader Kings 3 is a superb strategy game, a great RPG, and a master class in how to take the best parts of existing systems and make them deeper and better. I have thousands of hours in the previous game, and I expect to spend at least that many in this third installment. All of the engrossingly flawed characters and stories of love, war, triumph, and loss that have already dynamically emerged from my playthroughs feel like just the beginning of something legendary. In fact, if I had to pick only one game to play for the rest of my life, the decision wouldn’t be that difficult. A new king of historical strategy has been crowned. Long live the king.

> Every detail of Crusader Kings III feels like the perfect evolution of the series. The refined systems and better UI don’t take away from the complexities of a campaign; they just make it easier to have fun. Every worry I had of this being a watered-down Crusader Kings II experience faded away with the sheer amount of content available. With a larger world, more refined systems, gorgeous visuals and deep character mechanics, Crusader Kings III is everything fans of the series could have hoped for – and more.

> ... You can easily sink hours into it without realising you had, which is fantastic to get that feeling out of a game. For fans of RPG, simulation, strategy games and previous Crusader Kings titles, this is a must-have.  I have already seen people crying over on Reddit on how much they want the game to drop already.  Bonus for Crusader Kings 3 fans who have Xbox GamePass for PC that’s available on day one too.

> Crusader Kings III is all about the dynasty you’ve built, and the legacy you leave behind for a future of fame, fortune, and family in an ever-unfolding drama that’s brought unto you, or what you create for yourself. There’s a chasm-wide cast of characters to play as from real royal families from hundreds of countries, many of which you’ll want to see them through. Whether a new or returning player, hours will pass like minutes, and you’ll realize the game has a hook on you that you won’t want to remove. This is grand strategy at its finest, and Crusader Kings III is an immensely replayable, unscripted narrative masterpiece.

> All in, Crusader Kings 3 is my Game of the Year so far. If you’re looking for a new strategy title with some RPG flair that will suck you in for 500 hours or more during this endless lockdown, then it should be on your wishlist already. Better still, future support is already assured – there’s one expansion already in the works plus a few flavour packs coming soon if the huge base game isn’t enough for you.

>Hundreds upon hundreds of characters live their lives on the map. They struggle for survival, they murder, they cheat, they make love, they give birth, they conquer and are conquered, they rise to glory of fall into misery, exactly like you. Not only Crusader Kings 3 is one of the best RPGs I’ve ever played, but it’s also one of the best world simulators I can think of. It’s basically the Sims without the gibberish and with swords, on a much, much grander scale.

**StrategyGamer** \- Timothy Borsilli \- [5 / 5](https://www.strategygamer.com/reviews/crusader-kings-3/)

> Despite these few grievances, Crusader Kings III is undoubtedly one of – if not the – best strategy releases of the past few years. By building on the Game of Thrones-style drama and intrigue that its predecessor excelled at, it makes for engrossing gameplay that combines the best of the grand strategy and RPG genres. With Paradox pushing hard to make CK3 much more accessible to an unfamiliar mainstream audience, there has never been a better time to take a leap and see why this series has inspired such a dedicated fanbase. While it may not yet have all the bells and whistles of its predecessor, this is possibly the most polished a mainline Paradox title has ever been at launch.

> I might have mentioned that Crusader Kings 2 was one of my favorite games. All I really want out of a game - any game - is to lose myself in a good story. Crusader Kings gives me that, fresh, every time I sit down to play. Crusader Kings 3 is at the start of its own story - I'm estimating we're going to see around 300 DLCs for this beast before it's all said and done - and already through its clarity of interface and intelligent design decisions I can see years of amazing ""OH MY GOD, you'll never guess what happened in CK3"" moments clogging up Felix's email inbox as I continue on my own journey with this wonderful, wonderful game.

>It's an irrepressible story engine that spits out a constant stream of compelling alt-histories, delightfully infuriating characters and social puzzles that I've become obsessed with unravelling. I can't imagine being done with it. I just subsist on digital drama now. Will Alfred finally leave the torture chamber and make a friend? What's Bjorn going to do now that he knows his wife is in love with his chancellor? And who's going to be committing patricide next? I need to spend less time writing reviews and more time with my dynasties.

> It’s clear that Crusader Kings is not a game for everyone. It’s dense, complex, at times slow, at other times overwhelming. But there’s a magic here, a storytelling generator that you won’t find anywhere else. It’s a series that already has a lot of fans, and I think those fans are going to agree with me when I declare Crusader Kings 3 the best Crusader Kings yet. There are also a lot of people who may become fans, and to them, I declare this game as easily the most accessible Crusader Kings. Not only is it a strange and wonderful experience, but it also promises to grow more exciting with future updates. You can’t get your Crusader Kings fix anywhere else, and Crusader Kings 3 takes the series to new heights.

> As much as it remains a numbers-driven grand strategy game, Crusader Kings III masterfully paints a complex medieval world teeming with living characters that have desires and ambitions. Its mixture of familiar and evolved systems enhances its roleplaying and emergent storytelling potential. The actions that you perform always feel like they’re the result of a process or skill your characters have naturally gained and there’s always something to grab your attention. And so it did, as for 70+ hours we were completely absorbed by warfare, realm management and court intrigue, which, it turns out, we haven’t had enough of just yet.

> Crusader Kings III is not a revolution compared to the second installment. But it is a good evolution. Crusader Kings III is Paradox's masterpiece. It still has some flaws that already had the second part, and is possibly less complete, in content, than the second part with all the DLCs. But it can be said that CK3 vanilla is much more than CK2 vanilla. And the additions such as the house system, the new way of managing the baronies or the perks in the lifestyles are very good additions, in addition to a total visual redesign, with a friendly interface for the new player. Highly recommended. And more knowing that, even without the need to buy paid expansions, Paradox will maintain the game with regular updates.

>[Crusader Kings III is] a game that excels at creating a story that will captivate you regardless of what kind of story you want to tell. It will surprise you all too often in how each system interacts with each other and how your neighbours and family respond to your actions. House Forez’ trials and tribulations will stay with me for some time, and I hope that those who play this will create a dynasty that is as memorable for them as this one was for me.

>Crusader Kings III is an excellent kingdom management game, more intimate but no less intricate than the likes of Civilisation VI, it’s as unforgiving a simulation as you’re going to find while still being more fun than you’d expect it to be. It’s not an easy game to get to grips with, and there are moments where you won’t be able to declare a war or prevent one and it won’t always be clear why – and there is an awful lot to read and understand – but Crusader Kings III is still arguably the best way to play out your Game of Thrones fantasies without actually harming your family members.

> Arriving as it does on the eve of what may be a succession crisis in the United States – that grand experiment in Enlightenment ideas of popular sovereignty – it’s tempting to think of Crusader Kings III as a kind of divine omen. Paradox’s latest incarnation of its medieval dynasty simulator is not only strangely portentous, but it’s also the most accessible the studio’s grand strategy games have ever been. Thanks to a near total rework of its interface, an enhanced new build of the underlying Clausewitz engine, and a generous new system for keeping players informed, Crusader Kings III is the new gold standard for the genre.

> While Crusader Kings III has shortcomings and flaws, these are overshadowed by the sheer number of options and content thanks to its gigantic map and features. Greater emphasis is placed on a character's or dynasty's growth, a level of detail not seen in any previous grand strategy title, allowing you to experience trials and tribulations like never before.

> My dream of liberating Bharata remained after all… a dream. From a growing empire at the zenith of its power to a small dutchy, grappling with the burden of post-war recession, the splinter states warring among themselves. It was not game over but I gave up. Feeling bouts of rage and disappointment and a strange eagerness to try something different, I promised to return one day. I was yet to explore Africa, East Asia and the Middle East. I felt determined, but I was not sad. This parting was only temporary. It is this unpredictability that makes it such a great and terrible game at the same time. Nevertheless, Crusader Kings III, with the sheer amount of content, will give you the most bang for your bucks. And if you are a challenge-loving bloke, you will love it and you will keep coming back for more because as I said before, it never gets boring. The replayability itself is worth paying for.

[**TheSixthAxis**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis) \- [Stefan L.](https://opencritic.com/critic/313/stefan-l) \- [9 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/31/crusader-kings-iii-review/)

> The best way to think of Crusader Kings 3 as a sequel is in terms of its own dynastic gameplay. Sure, Paradox have started from scratch with a new game, but it's still full of scheming, warring amidst an impressive breadth of cultures and religions. Crusader Kings 3 is an heir that has been born from Crusader Kings 2 and its many expansions, including and improving on so much of what made that game great, but it can still grow and improve in its own right.

[**Shacknews**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/62/shacknews) \- [TJ Denzer](https://opencritic.com/critic/331/tj-denzer) \- [9 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/120077/crusader-kings-3-review-your-noble-story-eternally-unfolding)

> It truly is incredible how much Paradox Interactive improved upon not only how the player engages with the world, but also how the world itself is a living, breathing place beyond your actions and whims, full of characters trying to achieve their own goals. Every story, even with the same ruler, has the potential to play out vastly different, and your narrative will likely be unique from mine. All things considered, Crusader Kings 3 is perhaps one of the most immersive and flexible strategy games ever put together.

>Crusader Kings III pulls off a difficult dual victory, bringing a new level of depth, charm, and polish to the franchise, while also making it far more approachable than before. Some aspects of Crusader Kings III still aren’t as user-friendly as they could be, but overall, this is a worthy heir to the throne.

> If you've always been intrigued by the idea of Crusader Kings but bounced off of it, Crusader Kings 3 is the best way to get started. It looks and feels great, and it already has a ton of available content at launch. DLC will indeed run thick, but it doesn't feel like the base game is missing aspects out of the gate. At the same time, CK3 is great for veterans. A lot of fan-favorite elements that were added to CK2 over a decade of DLC are already here, and most of the systems are close enough to the same family tree that you shouldn't have trouble taking kingdoms over.

> Without many words, Crusader Kings III is one of the best Paradox Interactive grand strategy games to date.

[**The Games Machine**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/497/the-games-machine) \- [Daniele Dolce](https://opencritic.com/critic/4728/daniele-dolce) \- [8.8 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/crusader-kings-iii-pc/crusader-kings-iii-recensione/) \- _Italian_

> Crusader Kings III is one of the best Paradox Develpment Studio's games to date. Deep and compelling, this grand strategy can entertain you for dozens, if not hundreds of hours between its intrigues, holy wars, and dynasties in the making.

[**Game Revolution**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/93/game-revolution) \- [Jason Faulkner](https://opencritic.com/critic/448/jason-faulkner) \- [4.5 / 5](https://www.gamerevolution.com/review/657750-crusader-kings-3-review) \- _Editor's Choice_

> This review only skims a bit of what the game offers, as it’s incredibly complex. However, I feel like CK3 introduces its various systems in a much easier-to-grasp way than CK2 did. So, if you’ve been intimidated about Paradox’s grand strategy games, CK3 makes a new beginning that continues to provide all the fun of medieval intrigue, drama, and history, while making it a lot easier to pick up and play.

[**Attack of the Fanboy**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/116/attack-of-the-fanboy) \- [Brandon Adams](https://opencritic.com/critic/6501/brandon-adams) \- [4.5 / 5](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/crusader-kings-iii-review/)

> I’ve never been the biggest fan of grand strategy games, yet I can’t put the it down. Crusader Kings III’s near perfect marriage of robust grand strategy with compelling roleplaying means both fans of wargames and storytelling aficionados will find something to love in its medieval world of politics and intrigue, whether that’s crunching numbers to efficiently conquer the known world, or rolling with the punches as they scheme their way into the annals of history.

[**TrustedReviews**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/326/trustedreviews) \- [Ryan Jones](https://opencritic.com/critic/6159/ryan-jones) \- [4.5 / 5](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/crusader-kings-3)

>Crusader Kings 3 is a fantastic new entry to the history-rooted strategy series, putting a larger emphasis on character-driven narratives and opening up more entertaining opportunities for increasing the size of your kingdom. A huge number of quality-of-life improvements makes menu navigation significantly easier, while new in-game guides and tutorials makes it far more friendly for newcomers to learn the basics. It’s also a lot better to look at with 3D character models and more detailed maps ensuring a more immersive experience. Technical issues and unreliable AI-controlled allied troops prevent Crusader Kings 3 from a perfect score, but this is undoubtedly the best entry to the series yet and will only likely get better with the guaranteed expansions. 

[**Gameliner**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner) \- [Dionne Lips](https://opencritic.com/critic/7573/dionne-lips) \- [4 / 5](https://www.gameliner.nl/reviews/review-crusader-kings-iii-een-toonbeeld-van-strategiegames-pc/4940-1-1-283) \- _Dutch_

> Although Crusader Kings III is quite complex and it is certainly not suitable for the casual gamer, it is a strong game in the real time strategy genre. Fortunately, Crusader Kings III is a lot more accessible and easier to play than its predecessors due to the many added tools. Although it is sometimes still difficult to figure out exactly what to do. The different levels of difficulty and the fact that you can determine yourself at what pace the game takes place, come in handy in any case. Players can immerse themselves better in Crusader Kings III as the characters, traits, skills and lifestyle make everything more personal. So if you have quite a few hours left to spare and have a soft spot for strategy games, then Crusader Kings III is an excellent choice.

[**GameSpot**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot) \- [David Wildgoose](https://opencritic.com/critic/5635/david-wildgoose) \- [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crusader-kings-3-review/1900-6417551/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)

> In a sense, Crusader Kings 3 is all over the place. It doesn't always work perfectly, and at times it really makes you work for it, but there's something amazing in that any of it works at all. Strategy games can tell interesting stories as their empires rise and fall, but their procedural narratives are rarely as affecting and poignant as they are here.

**Cerealkillerz** - Gabriel Bogdan - *German* - [9 / 10.0](https://cerealkillerz.org/just-cause-4-review-explosive-freiheit/)

>Just Cause 4 offers the most diverse and beautiful Playground of the Series so far and finally optimized some parts from Just Cause 3 like the generic enemies and repeated order of missions. The Apex Engine delivers an amazing performance (PC Version) and we can recommend this game even with its unfinished cutscenes and a lot of arduous NPC accompanying missions.

>In spite of trotting out a premise that's been done to death, Just Cause 4 remains fresh thanks to its creative gameplay features and varied missions. With explosions aplenty and stunning visuals, there's little amiss with this over the top entry in the series

--------------

**Gamers Heroes** - Blaine Smith - [6 / 10](http://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/just-cause-4-review-chaotic-repetition/)

>Just Cause 4 is a fantastic playground of chaos, giving players the tools and creative options to sow seeds of complete mayhem. It's only when you step away from that mayhem, following the path of the campaign put ahead of you, that you'll find repetition, lack of character, and a disappointing open world.

**GameSpace** - William Murphy - [8.1 / 10.0](https://www.gamespace.com/reviews/just-cause-4-review-pc/)

>If you love open world games that let you loose to just play with things and see what kind of mayhem you can create, there's no better series than Just Cause 4. And while this holiday season is filled to the brim with new games, I would strongly advise against sleeping on Rico's latest adventure. It's one you'll be guaranteed to have dozens of hours of fun with. Recommended.

--------------

**God is a Geek** - Gary Bailey - [8 / 10.0](https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/just-cause-4-review/)

>With its extreme weather scenarios and the familiar, over-the-top usage of Rico's grapple gun, wingsuit and parachute, Just Cause 4 is the most ridiculous and best it has ever been.

**IGN** - Dan Stapleton - [7.9 / 10.0](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/04/just-cause-4-review)

>Just Cause 4 is a slightly better version of Just Cause 3's destruction-fueled action, but lacks a big new idea to give it an identity of its own.

--------------

**PC Gamer** - Robert Zak - [73 / 100](https://www.pcgamer.com/just-cause-4-review/)

**PC Invasion** - Tim McDonald - [3.5 / 5 stars](https://www.pcinvasion.com/review/just-cause-4-pc-review/)

--------------

**PCGamesN** - Julian Benson - [7 / 10](https://www.pcgamesn.com/just-cause-4-review)

>Just Cause 4 refines everything that made its predecessor great. It's still one of the most generous and bombastic open world games, but its new systems don't progress the sandbox as much as they should.

>Solis is a huge island, which allows for a realistic distribution of targets, and environmental diversity. There's some pleasure to be had exploring its various environs of city, jungle, mountain and beach-fronts, making use of an almost infinite variety of vehicles.

**Shacknews** - Charles Singletary Jr - [8 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/108829/just-cause-4-review-chaotic-good)

>Beyond the occasional crashes and the visual flicker, the game ran fairly well with so many things happening on screen. I never noticed any significant slowdown, even with the game’s weaponized weather completely upending the area around me. At worst, there’s a slight framerate dip with massive rapid explosions, but nothing that impacted my gameplay experience. Overall, Just Cause 4 is a very entertaining package and its potential won’t be fully tapped for a long time.

**Spaziogames** - Paolo Sirio - *Italian* - [6.8 / 10.0](https://www.spaziogames.it/just-cause-4-recensione/)

>If you enjoyed the last game in the series then Just Cause 4 will give you a lot of fun creating explosions across the world, it just doesn’t push the series in any meaningful direction.

--------------

**TechRaptor** - Robert Scarpinito - [8.5 / 10.0](https://techraptor.net/content/just-cause-4-review)

>Just Cause 4 is the most essential game in the series, perfecting years of blowing things up in the most creative ways. While the narrative doesn't have any lasting impact, the overall package delivers as video game comfort food.

--------------

**The Games Machine** - Erica Mura - *Italian* - [7.3 / 10.0](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/just-cause-4/just-cause-4-recensione-pc-ps4-xbox-one/)

>The latest adventure of Rico Rodriguez, with its good dose of adrenaline and over-the-top action, forces our hero to embark on a real impossible mission to dismantle the dangerous Project Illapa. Despite the lack of variety and the exaggerated length of the campaign, Just Cause 4 still manages to push the boundaries of players' imagination, dragging them once again into a world of destruction, explosions and pure chaos.

--------------

**TheSixthAxis** - Dominic Leighton - [8 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/12/04/just-cause-4-review/)

>Just Cause 4 is the best entry in the series to date, offering spectacular free-wheeling destruction on a scale that's not been attempted before. Rico remains one of gaming's most enjoyable protagonists, but more than ever before, it's really all about what he's capable of doing rather than the events unfolding around him.

--------------

**VG247** - Phil Iwaniuk - [No Verdict](https://www.vg247.com/2018/12/03/just-cause-4-review-pc-performance/)

>The pros and cons shout over one another constantly, and I think that’s why I find it such a frustrating game to play

--------------

**Windows Central** - Brendan Lowry - [5 / 5 stars](https://m.windowscentral.com/just-cause-4-review-chaotic-and-addicting-open-world-experience)

>Featuring a deep and diverse world, addictive action gameplay, and a fantastic new engine, Just Cause 4 is easily the best game in the series, hands down.

>Devil May Cry 5 is a legendary comeback for Devil May Cry series and every aspect of it from its lovely fast paced gameplay to its unique and impactful story, all reminisce the great time we had with this series throughout the years. It's not a game only for true fans of Devil May Cry, I think every gamer should give it a chance to understand the true meaning of Hack 'n' Slash and Action Adventure.

>Devil May Cry 5 excels at bringing back that iconic feeling the franchise is known for and does so with killer style, strategic, fast-paced combat, and a pumping soundtrack. With a cast of both familiar faces in Trish and Lady, as well as newcomers Nico and V, this is a game that gives me confidences for the future of the Devil May Cry series.

>Devil May Cry 5 is a masterpiece in action. It has heart and charm in its epic story that comes full circle on the series.

>Devil May Cry 5 is a great action game, created for fans of the original universe, which is almost all superior to the DMC4, but makes a few new mistakes. Crumpled story, with a focus on fan service, which jumps in time, ragged ending and featureless levels can be a disappointment. At the same time improved combat system, great variety of bosses and opponents, along with beautiful characters, great battle tracks and spectacular cutscenes will not disappoint you.

>Even though it sometimes feels uncharacteristically by the numbers in some places or fails to have a noticeable amount of pizazz, Devil May Cry 5 is a hell of a good time. With plenty of wonderful character moments that'll make fans gush, a glorious frenzy of bloody action, and a healthy dose of great metal music to score it all, Capcom has triumphantly returned yet another beloved franchise to its former glory.

>Devil May Cry 5 won't be a total disappointment thanks to its stunning production values. Aside from the recent Resident Evil 2 remake, this is the best-looking game Capcom has ever made. Its adventure is a fun one if you don't take it too seriously (which shouldn't be too hard). As much as I can gripe about its flaws, it's hard not to grin when you're shoving a running motorcycle wheel into a demon's face. But this isn't an action classic.

It doesn’t care that it’s still a linear game; it doesn’t care that it’s a hack ‘n slash in 2019; it doesn’t care that its story is mostly fan service. It embraces everything that it is – despite those elements typically being labeled as dated – and we love it more because it’s doing that.

>In the end, Devil May Cry 5 doesn't reinvent the wheel. Instead, it takes everything that fans of the series loved, dials it up to 11 and presents one of the best game in the series yet. Right up there with Devil May Cry 1 and 3 for me. Plenty of combat, the pacing is just right, and a nice amount of content to play through once you've reached the end. My only gripe is those blasted microtransactions, which I feel has no place in a game like this. A minor inconvenience in what I consider an enjoyable action game that I haven't been able to put down. It looks like Capcom has yet another GOTY contender on their hands. Devil May Cry 5 is every bit the game I was looking forward to and then some.

For those looking for a hardcore hack-and-slash with inventive new weapons, amazing bosses, and fantastic characters this is the game you need. While it’s disappointing it took so long to get back here, DMC V is more than worth the wait.

/r/Games/comments/hjxy7q/lost_odyssey_the_lost_final_fantasy_game/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/hjxy7q/lost_odyssey_the_lost_final_fantasy_game/,"Lost Odyssey- the lost ""Final Fantasy"" game exclusive to the Xbox 360- would really benefit from a remaster and a PC release.",315,1683,Intern_Waffle,"Lost Odyssey is a 2007 Xbox 360 exclusive JRPG by Mistwalker, a studio founded by Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of the Final Fantasy series, and developed by a number of Final Fantasy veterans, including going so far as to have music composed by Nobuo Uematsu. It is, in all aspects but name and some minor details (like the phoenix feathers you use to revive teammates not being called Phoenix Down, for instance), a Final Fantasy title. It even features a Cid character (cleverly disguised by being named *Sed*, but very, very clearly supposed to be the game's Cid).

It's a full length JRPG with an esoteric plot and an attempt at doing something different with its gameplay mechanics that hits on every Final Fantasy staple and I have always thought its name was a tongue in cheek reference to the series. Final Fantasy...Lost Odyssey...Final Fantasy's Lost Odyssey, something like that. There's a connection there.

Regardless, Lost Odyssey is a wonderful game that, with some QOL updates and a wider release, would probably sell very well today.

The gameplay involves 5 party members maximum at a time, with a front row and back row, fighting up to...I believe 8 enemies at a time. It very much feels like old school Final Fantasy games brought into 3D. It's turn based, but with some caveats. Like Final Fantasy X, certain actions ""take longer"" and so turn order is determined by which action someone is going to take. 

Items are instant, melee attacks are same turn, but spells delay action for one or more turns. If you're hit by an enemy, your action can be delayed. Actions can even be cancelled on the next turn if you change your mind. When you do a melee attack, there's a timing element where you release the attack button in time with two rings that intersect. Accuracy determines damage, but also how strong an effect applied to the attack based on rings you have equipped will hit. You can synthesize components into new rings, or upgrade them.The back line at the start of battl is given a shield based on the combined HP of the front line. As the front line takes damage, that wall gets destroyed gradually. 

The game's biggest party feature however is that some party members are *Mortal*, and some are *Immortal*. Mortals level up like standard JRPG protagonists, and can equip accessories granting new skills. Immortals, however, do not learn skills by leveling up. Instead, they must ""Link"" to a mortal character currently part of the battl party. When they do, they earn points in battle that eventually pass the mortal's selected skill onto them. Immortals can also permanently learn accessory skills. If an immortal is killed in battl, they revive automatically after a few turns.

Boss battles are actually really fun- one of the earliest bosses in the game is actually near impossible if you're not properly utilizing accessories to teach several people one skill. 

And the music is [incredible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQeW8M3F_KU). [Here's the main battle theme](https://youtu.be/DMpov_WHtWg), and here's an [amazing boss battle theme](https://youtu.be/aTBqAkHL9aE) that just keeps ESCALATING, culminating in a loud cacophonous trumpet flourish that signifies the song's full loop. And here's the [world map theme, which starts out with woodwinds but then throws in some sick electric guitar because why not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YDipkGmTzQ).

Aside from the unique gameplay system, the game's plot is told in a fascinating way I've never seen done before or again: The main character (and the other immortals) are all your standard RPG amnesiac, except they regain very strong and severe memories throughout the game through ""Thousand Years of Dreams"".

When you interact with certain NPCs, see certain scenes, find certain things, etc, you'll be prompted to view a dream, which is a story the character has been reminded of, giving you serious backstory on who they are, why, and how.

These dreams are presented almost in *Powerpoint presentation* format. Background images, vague ones, are shown and animate and swap between each other as text appears dramatically on the screen, with accompanying music and sound effects. No voice over, no actual imagery, no character models- it's like a weird impractical evolution of the concept of a novel. 

[And every single one is emotionally devastating.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHM2JUhIwAg) Here's the very first one in the game if you're interested. It's 8 minutes long- most are around that length.

I have **never** cried more playing a JRPG than playing Lost Odyssey, and it was almost entirely down to these dream sequences. They are *strong*. They are powerful. They are emotionally engrossing, and they do a wonderful job explaining just how difficult life would actually be were one to live well beyond a normal human's life expectancy. They cover lots of themes but most revolve around the idea of immortality, life experience, loss, aging, death, and the constant knowledge that no matter what happens everyone you meet is going to be gone some day.

The game's actual main plot was pretty good IIRC and the characters are fun and unique as are their circumstances. 

With some minor adjustments to make the game a bit more accessible/engaging to play (I remember sequences in between Dreams and major plot points not being particularly fun to play, not in a bad way, just nothing special) I think Lost Odyssey would do quite well with a standard re-release. It's actually amazing to me this hasn't happened yet considering the game did not get a lot of attention at the time and the pedigree behind its development.",1593699900.0

Since one of the main reasons this thread is late is the fact I've been playing a lot of Hitman I decided to look at Hitman: Blood Money. This is not a full list of the people who worked on the game. I'm leaving out the support and management at IO, the voice actors and mocap actors, some of the musicians and the different parts of Eidos around the world. 

I've also changed the format of these threads slightly. Instead of sorting alphabetically I'm sorting by the order the people are listed in the credits.


As a note, IO had recent layoffs. If someone worked on the most recent Hitman and I wasn’t able to confirm they are still with the company, I’ll use words like “they seem to still be at IO”.

**Kotaku** - [Kirk Hamilton](http://opencritic.com/critic/977/kirk-hamilton)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-origins-the-kotaku-review-1819862017)|*Assassin’s Creed Origins is ungainly and uneven, beautiful and frustrating, expansive and unexpectedly conservative. It won’t challenge the palate; rather, it is a prime example of video-game comfort food. It’s here to be slowly enjoyed, offering a seemingly endless supply of gorgeous locales and steadily-filling progress bars. If Ubisoft is a digital travel agency, Origins provides one of the most sweeping, enveloping destinations they’ve yet offered. Come for the beautiful recreation of ancient Egypt, stay for the beautiful recreation of ancient Egypt.*|
**VG247** - [Brenna Hillier](http://opencritic.com/critic/4321/brenna-hillier)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://www.vg247.com/2017/10/26/assassins-creed-origins-review-ubisofts-open-world-formula-is-back-on-its-feet/)|*Assassin’s Creed Origins is not a dramatic departure from the formula as we last saw it, but manages to be much more fun and feel way more fresh than any entry since Brotherhood and Black Flag. It plays to the strengths of a genre Ubisoft helped bring into the mainstream, respects the player and their freedom, and allows them to beat up crocodiles. I’m into it.*|
**Ars Technica** - [Daniel Starkey](http://opencritic.com/critic/638/daniel-starkey)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/assassins-creed-origins-review-a-living-breathing-ancient-world/)|*A shining example of what exploration-based games can be, dropping many of its franchise's worst traits even while being sometimes held back by the mundane. Buy it.*|PS4
**AngryCentaurGaming** - [Jeremy Penter](http://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter)|Wait for Sale ~ [Wait for Sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LGEit022m0)|*This is actually a 'Wait for Sale'. Make no mistake, I loved a good deal of this game and travelling across this world is so frigging awesome-looking. Unfortunately, that's offset by a battle system that just wasn't as slick as say Zelda's, which I think it's trying to crib from, and the bugs that obviously got in the way. The game looks absolutely beautiful at times, but it does have a couple issues with pop-in and so forth. I think this is a title that, with a couple of patches, really could make me enjoy the part of the game that the game wants you to enjoy the most when it comes to change, and that is the battle. It just has some issues right now.*|
**Eurogamer** - [Christian Donlan](http://opencritic.com/critic/753/christian-donlan)|Recommended ~ [Recommended](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-26-assassins-creed-origins-review)|*Assassin's Creed returns and its vast and evocative Egypt inspires wonder - even if much in the game remains familiar.*|PS4
**GamesRadar+** - [Louise Blain](http://opencritic.com/critic/1090/louise-blain)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](http://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-origins-review-this-egyptian-playground-is-finally-everything-you-wanted-the-creed-to-be/)|*As beautiful as it is deadly, Origins' Egyptian playground is finally everything you wanted the Creed to be.*|
**Saudi Gamer** - [سندس الخباز](http://opencritic.com/critic/4122/-) - *Arabic*|100 ~ [10 / 10](https://saudigamer.com/review/assassins-creed-origins/)|*Assassin's Creed Origins took an amazing new direction with a brand new story, new world, and new hero. The story is quite epic and it presents some of the most important historical events and characters in Egypt. I loved the variety of targets and how each boss has a complete different approach that changes the combat strategy and gameplay.*|PS4
**GameSpace** - [GameSpace](http://opencritic.com/outlet/464/gamespace)|97 ~ [9.7 / 10](https://www.gamespace.com/assassins-creed-origins/review/)|*Assassin's Creed Origins is a breathtaking sensorial odyssey. It is the MMO I have been waiting for without the MMO part and boy would my heart skip a beat if it were massively multiplayer online. Ubisoft has won a new superfan.*|PC
**SA Gamer** - [Garth Holden](http://opencritic.com/critic/2217/garth-holden)|95 ~ [9.5 / 10](https://sagamer.co.za/review-assassins-creed-origins-ps4)|*Moving away from the industrial sausage machine to a bespoke creation oozing with attention to detail, history, love and satisfying combat, Ubisoft is back in the ring, ready to take on other open world contenders.*|PS4
**Oyungezer Online** - [Utku Çakır](http://opencritic.com/critic/3618/utku-ak-r) - *Turkish*|93 ~ [9.3 / 10](http://opencritic.com/critic/3618/utku-ak-r)|*It's a magnificent restart for the Assassin's Creed franchise. Origins slowly but surely follows in the footsteps of The Witcher 3.*|PS4
**Forbes** - [Paul Tassi](http://opencritic.com/critic/1156/paul-tassi)|93 ~ [9.25 / 10](https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2017/10/26/assassins-creed-origins-review-ps4-the-gods-heard-your-prayers/#776023f16426)|*Assassin's Creed Origins improves from its past few installments in almost every way, yet it never quite reaches the heights of the games it tries to emulate.*|PS4
**Hobby Consolas** - [Álvaro Alonso](http://opencritic.com/critic/3755/-lvaro-alonso) - *Spanish*|92 ~ [92 / 100](http://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-assassins-creed-origins-ps4-xbox-one-pc-171222)|*Origins can pretty much be considered one of the best entries in the series (if not the best) for introducing a myriad of changes, all for the best, and making the series advance in the same way Assassin's Creed II did back in the day. Put it into a sarcophagus next to the pharaohs, because this game is worth of the Valley of the Kings.*|XB1
**IGN Middle East** - [Islam Ibrahim](http://opencritic.com/critic/4382/islam-ibrahim) - *Arabic*|92 ~ [9.2 / 10](http://me.ign.com/ar/mrj-ign-lshrq-lwst-llb-assassins-creed-origins/119886/review/mrj-ign-lshrq-lwst-llb-assassins-creed-origins)|*Ubisoft has promised that Assassin's Creed Origins will bring the series back to its roots, but it surpassed its roots. It provided amazing RPG system and led us to a journey we would never forget in Ancient Egypt.*|PS4
**Critical Hit** - [Noelle Adams](http://opencritic.com/critic/4623/noelle-adams)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.criticalhit.net/review/assassins-creed-origins/)|*Assassin's Creed Origins is a pharaoh's tomb chock-full of shiny treasures for gamers, especially those fascinated with Ancient Egypt. The side quests may feel a little repetitive, but the credible, nuanced characters and diversity of the main plot make up for it. And with so much to explore and do in its jaw-dropping setting, Origins is exceptional.*|PS4
**Gameblog** - [Julien Hubert](http://opencritic.com/critic/3741/julien-hubert) - *French*|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.gameblog.fr/tests/2885-assassin-s-creed-origins-ps4-xb1-pc)|*If Assassin's Creed Origins is not perfect, it perfectly understood what it had to do to regain the hearts of the players and fans of the series. In addition to delivering the mysterious and fascinating ancient Egypt on a silver plate, in an absolutely gigantic open world, full of activities and secrets to discover, it succeeds in transforming its gameplay by brilliantly integrating RPG elements and completely renewing, with no less talent, its combat system. It will literally absorbs you for dozens and dozens of hours. Assassin's Creed Origins succeeds in taking care of its fans and its fundamentals, while starting its own revolution. We can only hope that the next episodes will keep this momentum.*|XB1
**Digitally Downloaded** - [Matt Sainsbury](http://opencritic.com/critic/1604/matt-sainsbury)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2017/10/review-assassins-creed-origins-sony.html)|*This is the best game in the Assassin’s Creed series. That extra year of development time has really helped Ubisoft find its creative centre again, and craft something that feels both fresh and energised. I could take or leave the shifts in gameplay to make this more like the loot-grind RPG-likes that dominate blockbuster game development now, but when Ubisoft is playing so beautifully within a fascinating period of history, all I care about is how utterly engrossed I am with the storytelling.*|PS4
**IGN** - [Alanah Pearce](http://opencritic.com/critic/246/alanah-pearce)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/assassins-creed-origins-review)|*Assassin's Creed Origins is a deep-dive into a truly stunning realization of ancient Egypt, with a rich series of cultures, genuine characters, and more mission variety than any other game in the series. The combat is challenging and thoughtful, and while the loot system doesn't match up to games like Destiny 2, there are enough different weapon types and enough enemy variety to keep you swapping between weapons, catered to the situation. The RPG elements encourage challenges of their own, and even despite a handful of bugs, I desperately wanted to keep playing.*|PS4, XB1, PC
**Game Revolution** - [Paul Tamburro](http://opencritic.com/critic/472/paul-tamburro)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/353085-assassins-creed-origins-review-egyptian-addiction)|*The extra year of development time paid off and ensured that Assassin’s Creed Origins likely wouldn’t underwhelm its audience by repeating its past sins. Instead, it modernized itself by adopting a more open structure and intuitive set of controls and gameplay systems, effectively marking a new chapter in the franchise. It’s fitting that Origins showed the birth of the Assassin’s Creed while also indicating the much-needed rebirth of the Assassin’s Creed series.*|XB1
**Eurogamer Italy** - [Lorenzo Mancosu](http://www.eurogamer.it/author/1654) - *Italian*|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.eurogamer.it/articles/2017-10-26-assassins-creed-origins-recensione)|*Assassin’s Creed Origins is one of the best open-world action games of this generation.

**Press Start** - [Brodie Gibbons](http://opencritic.com/critic/3662/brodie-gibbons)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2017/10/26/assassins-creed-origins-review-return-form/)|*I fell out of love with Assassin's Creed a long time ago, but Origins has recaptured the magic that made the series a powerhouse all those years ago. With its humble protagonist, whose outlook on life is clouded by relateable and crushing heartbreak, and a world so detail-rich, it's hard not to be floored by everything Origins manages to be. Assassin's Creed Origins is the definitive action-adventure game of the year. It's a wild power fantasy that satisfies not only a curious thirst for knowledge but both bloodlust and wanderlust to such lengths it's almost gluttonous.*|PS4
**IGN Spain** - [David Soriano](http://opencritic.com/critic/3431/david-soriano) - *Spanish*|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://es.ign.com/assassins-creed-origins-xbox-one/124618/review/assassins-creed-origins-analisis-multiplataforma)|*Assassin's Creed Origins manages to combine familiarity with revolution. Its RPG mechanics, new combat system and equiment management make you feel a fresh enough experience. The map is huge, beautiful and detailed, supported by an outstanding artistic direction. Unfortunately, the narrative fails to captivate us to make it closer to perfection.*|XB1
**EGM** - [Ray Carsillo](http://opencritic.com/critic/165/ray-carsillo)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/assassins-creed-origins-review/)|*Assassin's Creed: Origins delivers a robust experience that mixes up the traditional Assassin's Creed formula in a way that's fresh and fun to play—but which also harkens back to the series' roots in some welcome ways, too. It marks an evolution fans might not have even known they were waiting for, delivering one of the best overall experiences we've seen yet from the series.*|PS4
**Twinfinite** - [Ishmael Romero](http://opencritic.com/critic/74/ishmael-romero)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5](http://twinfinite.net/2017/10/assassins-creed-origins-review/)|*What we have here is a game that is more than it seems.

**Cheat Code Central** - [Sean Engemann](http://opencritic.com/critic/338/sean-engemann)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.cheatcc.com/ps4/rev/assassinscreedoriginsreview.html)|*Assassin’s Creed is one the greatest action-adventure franchises out there, though its hidden blades have been dulled of late from overexposure. After its brief sabbatical, Assassin’s Creed: Origins enters the arena glistening in the Egyptian sun with quality and quantity. Whether you’re a devout member of the Creed, someone who’s fallen off the hay wagon, or even a prospective new member of the Brotherhood, this is the time to dig your blade deep into a succulent new Assassin’s Creed.*|

It's a title that every fan of the series should play, because it correctly maintains the essence and implements fresh and fun elements to the series. To sum up, Assassin's Creed Origins is the renewal that the saga needed.*|PS4
**Atomix** - [Pamela Lima](http://opencritic.com/critic/4369/pamela-lima) - *Spanish*|87 ~ [87 / 100](http://atomix.vg/review-assassins-creed-origins/)|*Besides some minor technical and A.I. issues, Assassin's Creed Origins merges up as an astonishing, dynamic world where Bayek begins the history of the franchise. It surely represents a great way to celebrate 10 years of Assassin's Creed and a redemption chance for Ubisoft as a developer.*|PS4
**COGconnected** - [Erin Soares](http://opencritic.com/critic/1586/erin-soares)|86 ~ [86 / 100](http://cogconnected.com/review/assassins-creed-origins-review/)|*If you’ve been a fan of the series since the very beginning, let your faith in the series be restored, because Assassin’s Creed Origins is definitely the best title to come out of the popular series in a long time, if not ever. While there are still a few issues to be found within the game, the majority of problems found within the last few iterations in the Assassin’s Creed series have been replaced with nothing but beauty and adventure. Ubisoft has brought us a not only a captivating story in the perfect setting of Ancient Egypt but also a graphical masterpiece that is nothing short of breathtaking.*|PS4
**DualShockers** - [Noah Buttner](http://opencritic.com/critic/4263/noah-buttner)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](https://www.dualshockers.com/assassins-creed-origins-xbox-one-x-review-pc-ps4/)|*Assassin’s Creed: Origins may not be as revolutionary of a release in the open-world, action adventure RPG genre as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt or The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but it does provide an expansive single-player experience, filled with hours of memorable content without having to purchase anything extra. Assassin’s Creed: Origins is the most memorable entry in the series in years, answering age-old questions like “why are assassins missing their ring fingers?” and is an excellent game to start with if you’re a newcomer. While the story wasn’t consistent in quality throughout the entire game — and I didn’t know what was going on or what the stakes were at times — it culminates in a payoff that any fan of the Assassin’s Creed franchise will nerd out about for a long time.*|XB1

The story is passionate and the character of Aya is very cool. Perhaps the game is not perfect and had some trouble of game design, but we can surely say that is very good and a perfect way to follow for the next chapter.*|
**PlayStation LifeStyle** - [Ahmed Mohamed](http://opencritic.com/critic/542/ahmed-mohamed)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2017/10/26/assassins-creed-origins-review-birth-of-brothers-psls/#/slide/1)|*Assassin’s Creed Origins blew my expectations away in so many areas, but there’s still something missing that made the likes of Assassin’s Creed II and Brotherhood so special. However, this is most definitely the best title since then, and one that I’ll be jumping back into very soon. The new combat system makes for some incredibly satisfying moments, while the design of the world is only matched by the likes of The Witcher III. Ubisoft Montreal can be proud knowing that they’ve delivered a level of AAA-production that likely won’t be seen again until Cyberpunk 2077 rolls around, but there’s just that last leap of faith that needs to be made to once again deliver a generation defining game.*|PS4
**SegmentNext** - [Omar Majeed](https://segmentnext.com/author/omar/)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](https://segmentnext.com/author/omar/)|*Assassin’s Creed Origins is a step forward but not a complete overhaul of the franchise.*|

It’s a formula that people like to play, and it’s certainly been honed and improved over the years. Origins is, then, undoubtedly the best iteration of this formula yet. But I yearn for a fresh approach and new ideas, something that astounds the senses as much as the wondrous world this game inhabits.*|XB1

Revamped combat mechanics defibrillate the series with much-needed challenge. The guided open-world design encourages and rewards exploration unlike any Assassin's Creed game before it, and takes place in one of the series’ most memorable settings. But at the end of the day, and despite some growing pains, Origins is a culmination of the best aspects of the series. And for that, some hiccups in the transition to full-fledged RPG are a fair trade.*|XB1

**Reno Gazette-Journal** - [Jaosn Hidalgo](http://opencritic.com/critic/1639/jason-hidalgo)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](http://www.rgj.com/story/life/2017/10/31/pyramid-schemes-assassins-creed-origins-review-technobubble/816224001/)|*Assassin’s Creed returns with a polished take on the franchise’s mechanics as well as stunning visuals and vistas that will make you feel like a virtual tourist of Ancient Egypt. The gameplay itself doesn’t stray much from the classic formula, which can be good or bad depending on your view of the series’ gameplay. Improved combat, however, combined with a nicely crafted world and an intriguing protagonist make Assassin’s Creed Origins a worthy entry in the long-standing franchise.*|XB1
**PC Gamer** - [Christopher Livingston](http://opencritic.com/critic/710/christopher-livingston)|84 ~ [84 / 100](http://www.pcgamer.com/assassins-creed-origins-pc-review/)|*A brilliant setting, new systems, and familiar features blend together for a strong prequel to the Assassin's Creed series.*|PC

The vast new setting, the improved combat system and moving the series towards being a real action RPG have injected this series with a new life.*|PS4
**Gaming Nexus** - [Randy Kalista](http://opencritic.com/critic/513/randy-kalista)|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/5512/Assassins-Creed-Origins/)|*Origins was worth taking the year off. Egypt will be hard to top as a location. The series' dry, ironic, corporate sense of humor is still dull. But nobody can beat Assassin's Creed's architectural history lessons, even if you're still just stabbing folks and jumping out the window while you're sightseeing the entire timeline.*|PS4
**GamingBolt** - [Pramath](http://opencritic.com/critic/1195/pramath)|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/assassins-creed-origins-review)|*Almost at the cusp of true greatness, but not quite there, Assassin's Creed Origins is nonetheless a rousing adventure that truly manages to reverse the franchise's momentum after the double whammy of Unity and Syndicate.*|PS4

It tries a lot of new things, but it never ventures too far from the Assassin's Creed formula. There's a lot of potential in Origins, and it'll be exciting to see how the new features evolve in future games. Fans of Assassin's Creed should find a lot to like, and it may be time to revisit the battle between the Assassins and the Templars.*|PS4
**Gadgets 360** - [Rishi Alwani](http://opencritic.com/critic/1352/rishi-alwani)|80 ~ [8 / 10](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/assassins-creed-origins-review-1767517)|*All in all, there's more than enough to give Assassin's Creed Origins a go. Revamped combat, a fantastic representation of ancient Egypt, and a world crammed with things to do, Assassin's Creed Origins is a return to form of the franchise that has us optimistic on what to expect next.*|PS4
**TrustedReviews** - [Jordan King](http://opencritic.com/critic/2100/jordan-king)|80 ~ [4 / 5 stars](http://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/assassins-creed-origins)|*Assassin’s Creed Origins is the revitalisation I was desperately hoping for. My cautious optimism has been rewarded by an excellent open-world adventure that could lead to an exciting future for Ubisoft’s blockbuster franchise. While it lifts its finer ideas from other open-world titles, it executes them well enough to form a whole that entertained me for hours and hours. It’s a shame the narrative eventually jumps the shark, or this could have been something truly special.*|
**Destructoid** - [Chris Carter](http://opencritic.com/critic/431/chris-carter)|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-assassin-s-creed-origins-467154.phtml)|*I was really torn in assessing Assassin's Creed Origins, as it hits several of the same lows as the rest of the series, with its sometimes uneven mission structure and janky physics. But given that they now have the formula down to a science and didn't rush it out the door, all of that is a little easier to deal with than its predecessors. It was a big risk trying so many new things at once, but it worked, and the setting carries it.*|PS4

If you’re hoping to learn more about the Animus and Abstergo, then you’ll be disappointed because you’ll spend most of the game in ancient Egypt. But if you just wanted to show up and kill some dudes while touring the pyramids and gawking at the splendor of Alexandria at the height of its glory, then you’ll come away satisfied.*|PC

It's a lengthy game in a huge and varied open world that provides a foundation for what's to come, but it doesn't quite offer the breakthrough that the series was probably looking for.*|XB1
**Easy Allies** - [Michael Huber](http://opencritic.com/critic/667/michael-huber)|70 ~ [3.5 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFzGZFeBBdQ)|*Assassin’s Creed Origins isn’t the reinvention of the prolific franchise that many had hoped for. Instead, it refines the formula put in place a decade ago while telling an important story about the Assassins. Ancient Egypt is a compelling playground to explore, and the RPG elements make it easy to stay engaged. If you love the franchise, Origins is an easy recommendation. Just don’t except much change.

**Digital Trends** - [Mike Epstein](http://opencritic.com/critic/1782/mike-epstein)|60 ~ [3 / 5 stars](https://www.digitaltrends.com/game-reviews/assassins-creed-origins-review/)|*Assassin’s Creed Origins is what happens when you make a game without a vision for how players are supposed to engage with it. So many of the changes made to the game feel as if they were made in a vacuum, without a question as to whether they make sense together in the context of a long-running series. Not all games need loot. Not all games need RPG mechanics. As this franchise turns the corner into a new chapter of its never-ending tale, its developers would be wise to keep in mind (and pay a certain reverence) to what made the series special in the first place. While Origins keeps alive its narrative, the series’ most important component, there are certain mechanical elements of the series that deserve the same unequivocal respect.*|

>Marvel's Avengers is a game more focused on the future console generation than the present ones and so we can see on the PC version, however, those of us who will play it on current generations can still enjoy it to its fullest. Likewise, developers wanted to cover so much that in the end they failed keep it together. There are still some mechanics that are quite poor and too much content for some newbie players.

>Marvel's Avengers seems like a shoo-in for a future games-as-a-service ""bringing up your grades"" award.

>It's nowhere as annoying as the problems with combat though. If you can look past the latter — and it's not easy — you'll find a story that's largely well done, especially when it comes to Kamala's role in it.

>Marvel's Avengers is a typical holiday blockbuster with bright special effects, explosions, chases and familiar characters, which periodically descends into dullness with boring missions and tasks. Without all this tinsel and service elements, Marvel's Avengers would probably be a much more complete and interesting game. At the same time, Crystal Dynamics managed to create a really interesting character with Kamala Khan, who deserves much more attention than the rest of the Avengers squad.

>The future of Marvel's Avengers ongoing success will be completely dependent on the quality and regularity of content. However, as a game available today, it's a solid entry into the loot and shoot RPG space. The single player story is worth the price of admission alone, leaving the fun but dated approach to multiplayer a welcome addition for fans of the looter style approach.

>There are shades and traces of a simple yet heartfelt action game buried underneath Marvel's Avengers' corporate-driven money-grubbing muck that clearly needed a few more months of QA and technical fixing. Until its updates and content elevates the base experience and assuming the Day One/Week One patch fixes a LOT of these game's grievances, you'll have to settle for Earth's Mediocre Heroes.

>Marvel's Avengers is an enjoyable Avengers-themed brawler that's tied to an untested multiplayer mode. If all you want is to play through the video game equivalent of a Marvel movie, then it does an excellent job. If you're hoping for something you can play for infinite hours with constant updates, the truth is that it's too early to tell. What we played was fun for a few hours of co-op, but I have my doubts about its long-term viability. It's by far the best Avengers game ever made, and with the exception of Hulk (whose Hulk: Ultimate Destruction remains the pinnacle of Hulk gameplay), it features the best video game version of the superheroes to date.

>Despite a rocky reveal Marvel’s Avengers is a fun, and gorgeous game that is a blast to play both solo and with friends. Featuring a campaign with emotional heft and multiplayer that is built to last, it is an easy recommendation for any fan of either the genre or the source material.

**AngryCentaurGaming** - Jeremy Penter - [Wait For Sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65ZSDkbjUhk) (PS4, XB1)

>With enough going on here and enough side missions, somebody else may like this, but I certainly can't say this is anything other than a 'Wait for a sale'. It is not to the point to where you're waiting for a 'Deep, deep sale', but 50% off might be a good place to start looking for this title. In the end I think Marcus and his group could have been awesome, but instead of their version of Mr. Robot, they got their version of Swordfish, and I don't think anyone, anywhere wishes that on anyone else.

--------------

**Attack of the Fanboy** - Mike Guarino - [4 / 5 stars](http://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/watch-dogs-2-review/) (PS4, XB1)

>Watch Dogs 2 is about what you would expect in a sequel, as it reworks what didn’t click the first time around and expands upon what did. The game’s protagonist and accompanying cast of characters are fun to watch, and the hacking mechanics are better than ever. It’s just too bad that the overall story is forgettable, as it never really sucks you in despite its best efforts. Even so, those looking for an open-world experience mixed with fantastic hacking mechanics likely won’t be disappointed with what Watch Dogs 2 has to offer.

--------------

**Digitally Downloaded** - Nick H. - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2016/11/review-watch-dogs-2-sony-playstation-4.html) (PS4)

>Watch Dogs 2 does a great job of demonstrating the potential perils of a too-connected world and improves upon the first game in multiple ways. This is not a guns over brains game - there is an interesting topic at play here about our society's dependence on technology and Ubisoft deserves credit for exploring this theme. The characters and narrative are leaps and bounds more engaging than the revenge tale the original game tried to paint.

--------------

**Forbes** - Paul Tassi - [9 / 10](http://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2016/11/14/watch-dogs-2-review-ps4-every-dog-has-his-day/) (PS4)

>This is the game the original Watch Dogs should have been in many ways, and while it may still have more to learn, it’s hard to say that Watch Dogs 2 is anything but a success, and proof that Ubisoft can learn from their mistakes.

--------------

**NZGamer** - Hadyn Green - [9.7 / 10](http://nzgamer.com/reviews/2539/watch-dogs-2.html) (PS4)

>Watch Dogs 2 has created an immersive world, disturbingly close to the real one. It’s still a fictitious San Francisco, but sometimes it’s difficult to tell which bits are made up. With rich, in depth missions, colourful characters, and fun open world gameplay, this might just be the best game I’ve played this year.

>If you’ve the resolve to play the way the designers intended, Ubisoft’s latest tech parable eventually turns into a rollicking stealth action ride

--------------

**Pure Playstation** - Chris Harding - [8.5 / 10](http://pureplaystation.com/review-watch-dogs-2-ps4/2016/11/) (PS4)

>Nasty bugs aside, Watch Dogs 2 is a superb game. A true improvement over the franchise's first outing in just about every sense. A wicked cast of characters backed up by some sharp and witting writing. A visual treat for the eyes and a good mental workout with those mind-bending puzzles. A bloody good game, basically. If you've a gap where Assassin's Creed would normally be at this time of year, Watch Dogs 2 will fill the gap, make another gap, and fill that one too.

--------------

**Telegraph** - Kirk McKeand - [5 / 5 stars](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/watch-dogs-2-review---much-improved-hacker-sequel-makes-a-smart/)

>Despite these criticisms, the gorgeous world, snappy writing and its great characters will drag you through. I’m genuinely surprised with how much I adore Watch Dogs 2’s world. Its satire works because it is always punching up, never down. As such, Watch Dogs 2 feels like it’s making a statement. Rudyard Kipling once said, “San Francisco has only one drawback – ’tis hard to leave.” While Watch Dogs 2 isn’t as faultless as Kipling’s vision of Northern California, you’ll still want to spend tens of hours wandering this virtual recreation of the famous city and on into the Bay Area beyond.

--------------

**TheSixthAxis** - Miguel Moran - [9 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/11/14/watch-dogs-2-review/) (PS4)

>Watch Dogs 2 is the perfect sequel. It takes everything that made the first game unique and original, and expands on all of it. Everything is better, from the hacking, to the story, the setting and the variety of content. Watch Dogs 2 is far from being just more of the same. An apt comparison could be the jump from the first Assassins Creed game to Assassins Creed 2. While the first was a promising yet clunky new idea, the sequel delivered on that idea and turned it into one of the most iconic series of the last decade. With Watch Dogs 2, Ubisoft is well on its way to recreating that same magic.

--------------

**ThisGenGaming** - Charlie Oakley - [8 / 10](http://thisgengaming.com/2016/11/13/watch-dogs-2-review-ps4-pro-2/) (PS4)

>Watch Dogs 2 is better than the original Watch Dogs, I want to make that clear first as many people are probably wondering that. I enjoyed the story, the characters, and the location which is something I did not like in the first Watch Dogs game so everything better in Watch Dogs 2 after was all a bonus. Lets not sugarcoat it though, . It’s not what Assassin’s Creed II was to Assassin’s Creed, but it’s an improvement. Watch Dogs 2 still has it’s technical issues, A.I issues, and at times repetitive mission that brings the overall score down, but overall Watch Dogs 2 is definitely worth your time and trust that Watch Dogs might have killed.

--------------

**USgamer** - Mike Williams - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/watch-dogs-2-ps4-review) (PS4)

>Packing a vibrant, immersive open world, likeable cast of characters, and an engaging plot, Watch Dogs 2 is a good-looking, highly entertaining hacking romp that's not afraid to make a statement. Its missions give you a wide variety of ways to play them, encouraging you to be creative and inventive with your suite of technology-disrupting tools. It makes for a game that's involving, rewarding, and a lot of fun.

--------------

**Xbox Achievements** - Dom Peppiatt - [85%](http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/watch-dogs-2/review/) (XB1)

>There are a couple of ‘100% completion’ style things in the list, but for the most part the trophies and achievements are inventive and fun - generous rewards for progressing through the story, and smart little bonuses for taking part in the online and side ops. Hope you like boat racing!

--------------

**IGN** - Dan Stapleton - [8.5 / 10](http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/Watch-dogs-2-review) (PS4)

>[Tentative Score] It’s a shame Watch Dogs 2 is coming out in this partially crippled condition, because even though I wish I could recommend it more strongly, I can’t yet. If I had to score it now, I’d give it a 6.5 for okay, because I don’t think people should buy it right now unless they have no interest in the multiplayer portion. I do hope and expect that I’ll be able to raise that score in my final review, which will come later this week.

**IB Times UK** - Jake Tucker - [5 / 5 stars](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk//watch-dogs-2-review-ubisofts-hack-em-colourful-fun-vast-improvement-over-original-1591322) (PS4)

>I was expecting Watch Dogs 2 to be more enjoyable than its predecessor, but I didn't expect it to be so well designed and full of heart. Watch Dogs 2 isn't reinventing the open-world game and fans of Ubisoft's special brand of go-places-and-pick-things-up gameplay will feel right at home, but it's one of the best examples the genre has to offer – as long as you don't want to shoot anything.

--------------

**The Jimquisition** - Jim Fucking Sterling, Son - [9 / 10](http://www.thejimquisition.com/Watch-dogs-2-review/) (PS4)

--------------

**GameReactor** - Sam Bishop - [9 / 10](http://www.gamereactor.eu/reviews/480543/Watch+Dogs+2/) (PS4)

>At about 15-20 hours long, there is a lot of substance here; it's detailed, interesting, and, above all, fun. The art of hacking in Watch Dogs 2 produces gameplay variety that fans of the series will appreciate, and this, combined with an engaging roster of characters, a detailed world, and online that is a lot of fun, means that Watch Dogs 2 is definitely one to keep on your radar this year.

>Watch Dogs 2 is the Assassins Creed 2 of this franchise. While the first game was an imperfect attempt at a novel concept, the second one upgrades on its foundations in every way possible and presents a game that is not only a more comprehensive experience but also fun to play on repeat.

--------------

**GamesRadar+** - Vikki Blake - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.gamesradar.com/watch-dogs-2-review/) (PS4)

>Watch Dogs 2 builds upon the strengths of the original game, whilst polishing up aspects that lacked depth to deliver a coherent, comprehensive experience. Its diverse cast and (mostly) thought-provoking narrative trump the occasionally repetitive, maddening gunplay, and though the urban youth humour occasionally falls flat, for the most part its characters feel, talk, and react convincingly.

--------------

**PlayStation LifeStyle** - [8 / 10](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2016/11/14/watch-dogs-2-review-hack-the-world-ps4/#/slide/1) (PS4)

>While I still think that the best from Watch Dogs is still to come, Watch Dogs 2 is a solid step up from its predecessor. Getting to be a hacker is phenomenal fun, but the game tends to stumble when it becomes a sub-par third-person shooter. If you’re willing to put up with a story that doesn’t always jive with the light-hearted feel of its characters, then you’ll experience one of the most interesting open-world games in years.

--------------

**Destructoid** - Zack Furniss - [8.5 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-watch-dogs-2-399182.phtml) (PS4)

>I expected Watch Dogs 2 to be a paint-by-numbers sequel -- more guns, more cars, a bigger playground. Instead, it gives players freedom to play with the world with hackmagic the way they want to, and crafts a memorable, mostly light-hearted story that's just a lot of fun. Considering the heavy subject matter woven in, that's even more of an accomplishment than it seems like. After playing a bit of the first game, I was dreaming of a better second game with a much more compelling main character. Now, after finishing the second? I'm ready for the third game, but can we stick with Marcus for the rest of the series?

--------------

**GamingBolt** - Rashid Sayed - [9 / 10](http://gamingbolt.com/watch-dogs-2-review) (PS4)

>Watch Dogs 2 might very well be the best open world game of 2016. It offers ton of content, different ways to complete missions and brilliant visuals. If you are a fan of open world games, you should be playing Watch Dogs 2. Period.

--------------

**CGMagazine** - Mike Cosimano - [8.5 / 10](http://www.cgmagonline.com/reviews/watch-dogs-2-ps4-review/) (PS4)

>Dodgy framerate aside, the deeply political Watch Dogs 2 is an improvement over its predecessor in every possible respect.

--------------

**Paste Magazine** - Cameron Kunzelman - [7 / 10](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/11/watch-dogs-2-remains-unconvincing-despite-a-great.html) (PS4)

>I think that Watch Dogs 2 wants to say a whole lot about the contemporary world, but it never moves away from generic statements like “information good” and “military-industrial complex bad” to say anything specific. In fact, it has some profound convictions about not saying much at all. The positions it lays out remind me of competitive debate: forcefully presented but never all that convincing.

--------------

**Cheat Code Central** - Jenni Lada - [4.9 / 5](http://www.cheatcc.com/ps4/rev/watchdogs2review.html) (PS4)

>You have the freedom to explore San Francisco and see the sights, get involved with side quests, or keep going after Blume. It’s this wonderfully open and freeing experience and, while I can’t speak much to the multiplayer endeavors due to extenuating circumstances, Watch Dogs 2 feels like a stronger, more solid, and more enjoyable game.

--------------

**Game Revolution** - Aron Garst - [4.5 /  5 stars](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/watchdogs-2) (PS4)

>Watch Dogs 2 improves on every aspect from the original game, San Francisco is a world I want to spend time in and Marcus is a protagonist I actually enjoyed. It’s charming and imaginative all while not taking itself too seriously. If you’re looking for a sandbox adventure to fill some of the time until Red Dead Redemption 2, then Watch Dogs 2 might fill that craving.

--------------

**Hardcore Gamer** - [4.5 / 5](http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/11/14/review-watch-dogs-2/235508/) (PS4)

>For the most part, Watch Dogs 2 does what sequels are supposed to do: keep what worked in its predecessor and address the issues that held it back. The main missions are amusing, but it’s easy to get side tracked by the large amount of side quests that are scattered throughout San Francisco. Ubisoft has successfully recreated what made Grand Theft Auto great, but incorporates enough original ideas to set Marcus’ journey apart and make it feel fresh. There’s plenty to do outside of the main campaign, and being able to hack the entire city adds a unique element of enjoyment, especially for those who have an inclination to cause mayhem. In the end, Watch Dogs 2 is simply one of the best games of 2016.

--------------

**Do You Even Game Bro?** - Zach Johnson - [8.5 / 10](http://www.doyouevengamebro.net/watch_dogs-2-review/](http://www.doyouevengamebro.net/watch_dogs-2-review/) (PS4)

>Placing the series’ two entries side by side it’s clear that the hacker universe of Watch Dogs excels when it doesn’t take itself too seriously. With the addition of likeable characters, fun gameplay mechanics and an engaging narrative, Ubisoft may have given the Watch Dogs franchise a new lease on life.

--------------

**GameZone** - Tom Caswell - [6.5 / 10](http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/review-watch-dogs-2-is-an-honest-if-disjointed-improvement-k2qt) (PS4)

>I truly believe the team at Ubisoft absolutely wanted to create the perfect sequel to Watch Dogs, but this isn’t it. The hacking gameplay still does not feel organic and the characters swing too much in the jovial direction. But there’s still a lot to enjoy in this awesome recreation of San Francisco, so if you’re willing to overlook some of the game’s shortcomings, there’s still a lot to enjoy in Watch Dogs 2.

--------------

**Digital Trends** - Phil Hornshaw - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.digitaltrends.com/game-reviews/watch-dogs-2-review/)

>The good outweighs the bad, with Watch Dogs 2 providing lots of stellar opportunities for players to hack the planet.

--------------

**Worth Playing** - Chris *Atom* DeAngelus - [7 / 10](http://worthplaying.com/article/2016/11/15/reviews/101266/) (PS4)

>Overall, Watch Dogs 2 is a solid title that improves upon the original in gameplay and plot but still has some flaws. It's too easy at times, and the plot isn't structured well enough to have the desired impact, but that's easy to forgive when you're setting up a Rube Goldberg contraption to send a hacked car covered with sticky bombs into the middle of a group of gang members. It won't drastically change your mind if you disliked the first Watch Dogs, but if you found it flawed but fun, you'll probably enjoy the bulk of the sequel's improvements. The drop-in multiplayer and freedom of gameplay do a lot to keep the title feeling engaging, but it depends on a player's creativity in order to thrive.

--------------

**Eurogamer** - Simon Parkin - [Recommended](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-11-15-watch-dogs-2-review) (PS4)

>Ubisoft's sequel borrows from Rockstar's oeuvre to make a richly enjoyable open world game, despite its online troubles.

--------------

**Arcade Sushi** - Jason Fanelli - [8 / 10](http://arcadesushi.com/watch-dogs-2-review-playstation-4/) (PS4)

>Some specters from the previous game still exist, particularly in combat and a bit in driving, but Watch Dogs 2 improves on the original game in every way that counts.

--------------

**Slant Magazine** - Aaron Riccio - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.slantmagazine.com/games/review/watch-dogs-2) (PS4)

>Watch Dogs 2 not only represents a massive upgrade over its predecessor, but over similar open-world titles.

--------------

**COG Connected** - Ryan Tessler - [8 / 10](http://cogconnected.com/review/watch-dogs-2-review/) (PS4)

>While Watch Dogs 2 doesn’t reinvent the wheel when it comes to open world gameplay, it does provide enough creative ideas to keep even the most seasoned gamer amused.

--------------

**GameCrate** - Quibian Salazar-Moreno - [8.5 / 10](http://www.gamecrate.com/reviews/review-watch-dogs-2-captures-hacking-vibe-we-want/14985) (PS4)

>Watch Dogs 2 is definitely an improvement over the original. The entire vibe of the series has changed for the better, with likable characters, tongue-in-cheek scenarios, and a new hacks and gadgets that will keep you busy for quite a while.

--------------

**Kotaku** - Kirk Hamilton - [Unscored](http://kotaku.com/watch-dogs-2-the-kotaku-review-1789106378) (PS4)

>A significant improvement over its predecessor, filled with challenges that tested my problem-solving skills. It compensates for its technical shortcomings with a raft of interesting new ideas and a near-endless supply of things to do.

--------------

**Daily Dot** - Miguel Concepcion - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/watch-dogs-2-review/) (PS4)

>If one of Ubisoft's goals for Watch Dogs 2 was to address the dark tones and lack of personality in the original game, the studio fulfilled that objective with more charming characters and snappier dialogue. While many of the mission objectives aren't fundamentally any different in this second outing, the prevailing vibe of mischief adds color and humor to contemporary security and privacy matters, concerns that we should be taking very seriously in real life. Watch Dogs 2 is such a fully realized mid-2010s time capsule that—even if the online features are unavailable down the line—it would make for an especially insightful playthrough a decade from now, personal San Francisco native bias notwithstanding.

--------------

**Game Informer** - Elise Favis - [7.8 / 10](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/watch_dogs_2/b/playstation4/archive/2016/11/16/game-informer-watch-dogs-2-review.aspx) (PS4)

>Watch Dogs 2 addresses many of the issues of the first game, putting hacking at the forefront, but its narrative struggles to stay engaging. Although the cast is unlikeable, the parodies and its ability to not take itself seriously brings charm. The stellar hacking mechanics can make your actions, such as taking control of a satellite in outer space, feel grandiose and unstoppable in entertaining ways.

--------------

**Game Rant** - Denny Connolly - [4 / 5](https://gamerant.com/watch-dogs-2-review/) (PS4)

>Watch Dogs 2 excels at variety and, although there are many repetitive chores that players can choose to do in the open world, the main campaign never feels stale or redundant. Each mission takes players to a new, unique location full of bizarre characters and pop culture references and the lengthy campaign manages to fly by thanks to the immersive environment and the entertaining company that Marcus keeps. In a fall full of high-quality first-person shooters, Watch Dogs 2 is a welcome alternative that gives players something else fun to do besides pulling a trigger.

--------------

**PlayStation Universe** - Neil Bolt - [7.5 / 10](http://www.psu.com/review/31584/watch-dogs-2-review) (PS4)

>A vast improvement on the dull muddle that was the original Watch Dogs, Watch Dogs 2 embraces its chaotic, silly side without sacrificing the key components that gave the original such promise. It's prevented from grasping further glory by some damaging technical issues and a seamless online experience being notably absent, but Watch Dogs 2 is still a big bundle of joy.

--------------

**Gear Nuke** - Ali Moin - [8 / 10](http://gearnuke.com/watch-dogs-2-review/) (PS4)

>Watch Dogs 2 is a worthy successor to the original with an enjoyable single player campaign and engaging new cast of characters.

--------------

**Super Bunnyhop** - George Weidman - [Unscored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0HX2_q7D1U) (PS4)

>""The game's a mess of underutilized places and features padding a worthwhile core experience. Which is why I think Watch Dogs 2 would make an excellent sale pick-up later on to romp through in a weekend, but probably shouldn't be relied upon to give you a 40+ hour time sink for now. A lot of beat-to-beat moments here come so close to realizing the potential of those ten minute long E3 demos, but over the course of an entire sandbox-long game experience, the repetition of it all will begin to show holes. If you go through with it and pick up Watch Dogs 2, focus on the main story. Play it stealthily and peacefully, don't dwell on the side quests about climbing towers and racing cars, and you should have yourself a grand ol' time.""

--------------

**Easy Allies** - Daniel Bloodworth - [4 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU7fq01BP4M) (PS4)

>By shifting the tone and putting the emphasis on your hacker tools rather than guns, Watch Dogs 2 feels like a more fun and more thoughtful game, without losing the ability to create mayhem when the itch strikes. The controls can be an obstacle at times, and it's a shame that it's missing online features at launch, but it gives you a lot of room to experiment and play with your options.

______________________________________________________________________________________________

[IGN - 10/10
](http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/09/12/grand-theft-auto-v-review)

Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago.

[Gamespot - 9/10](http://uk.gamespot.com/grand-theft-auto-v/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review-6414475/?tag=Topslot;Slot1)

GTA V is an imperfect yet astounding game that has great characters and an innovative and exciting narrative structure, even if the story it uses that structure to tell is hobbled at times by inconsistent character behavior, muddled political messages and rampant misogyny. It also raises the bar for open-world mission design in a big way and has one of the most beautiful, lively, diverse and stimulating worlds ever seen in a game. Your time in Los Santos may leave you with a few psychological scars, but you shouldn’t let that stop you from visiting.

[Eurogamer - 9/10](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-09-16-grand-theft-auto-5-review)

GTA5 may not be the Hollywood-beating crime story it wants to be, then, but it's the best video game it's ever been, and I'll take that.

[Gametrailers - 9.8/10](http://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/p5jvw4/grand-theft-auto-v-review)

[Joystiq - 4.5/5](http://www.joystiq.com/2013/09/16/grand-theft-auto-5-review/)

Grand Theft Auto 5 is an ambitious game, attempting to meld three very different characters together to tell one encompassing story of survival in what amounts to the worst place in America. That story stumbles, but the open-ended gameplay remains a showpiece for the vast amount of content that can be poured into a virtual world.

[Giantbomb - 5/5](http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-598/)

Overall, this game is less surprising than you might like, because so much of it is precisely what you'd expect from a GTA game. As other open-world games push forward in ways that make things like traversal more convenient, GTA forces you to look at the minimap for your turn-by-turn directions. At times, it feels like it was made in a vacuum, away from the influence of other games. But while you could certainly pick out a handful of individual systems or design choices that feel like they've been handled more intelligently elsewhere, none of those other games bring together so many interesting and disparate systems with the same level of aplomb on display here. That, combined with the game's unique multi-character approach to storytelling, makes Grand Theft Auto V an exciting successor in the long-running franchise.

[Destructoid - 9/10](http://www.destructoid.com/review-grand-theft-auto-v-261879.phtml)

All three characters, in their respective ways, feel representative of the Grand Theft Auto series as a whole, and contribute to making GTA V what it is -- the ultimate culmination of Rockstar's beloved and despised series. Personally, I think that's a fine thing to be. 

[Edge - 10/10](http://www.edge-online.com/review/grand-theft-auto-v-review/)

No one makes worlds like Rockstar, but at last it has produced one without compromise. Everything works. It has mechanics good enough to anchor games of their own, and a story that is not only what GTA has always wanted to tell but also fits the way people have always played it. It’s a remarkable achievement, a peerless marriage of world design, storytelling and mechanics that pushes these ageing consoles to the limit and makes it all look easy.

[Polygon - 9.5/10](http://www.polygon.com/2013/9/16/4720458/gta-5-review-grand-theft-auto)

Rockstar has expanded and improved upon so much of what's special about video games as mainstream spectacles, from the playful use of characters to the refined take on world design. The developer's progress makes the aspects of the game left in cultural stasis — the poorly drawn women, the empty cynicism, the unnecessarily excessive cruelty — especially agitating.

It's fitting that the game arrives at the cusp of the next generation of consoles. Grand Theft Auto 5 is the closure of this generation, and the benchmark for the next. Here is a game caught occasionally for the worst, but overwhelmingly for the better, between the present and the future.

[Gameinformer - 9.75/10](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/grand_theft_auto_v/b/xbox360/archive/2013/09/16/grand-theft-auto-v-review.aspx)

Rockstar Games deserves credit for pushing the boundaries of its flagship franchise yet again with improved controls, great mission variety, and the most jam-packed open world I've ever visited. The narrative fails to match the impact John Marston or Niko Bellic's tales, but the colorful characters kept me interested in the story nonetheless. Like the golden state it parodies, Grand Theft Auto V is filled with beautiful scenery, a wealth of activities, and the promise of fortune.

[Official Xbox Magazine - 10/10](http://www.oxmonline.com/grand-theft-auto-5-review)

Grand Theft Auto V is one of the most impressive games of its generation - and a great last hurrah before we step up to the next one.

**AusGamers** - Joaby - [9.4 / 10](http://www.ausgamers.com/reviews/read.php/3561005) (PC)

>The things I've complained about with Battlefield One--collision detection, Suez as a map, people who play Scout, matchmaking--these are all ignorable issues. And the fact of the matter is that DICE has created one of the flat-out best multiplayer games in years. And with 60hz servers from the get-go and no noticeable issues with hit detection, it has clearly learned from Battlefield 4's launch. The campaign is worth checking out, Operations delivers clear forward thinking for Battlefield as a series in a way I think Rush never really did, and the maps are absolutely spectacular. Battlefield One is utterly brilliant. 

--------------

**EGM** - Nick Plessas - [8 / 10.0](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/battlefield-1-review/) (XB1)

>Battlefield 1 does a service to the series’ core fanbase with a unique, yet strangely familiar take on World War I.

--------------

**Forbes** - Paul Tassi - [8 / 10.0](http://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2016/10/17/battlefield-1-review-xbox-one-history-repeated/) (XB1)

>No one makes more beautiful shooters than DICE, but their gameplay still leaves something to be desired, despite what appeared to be a total refresh with the WWI setting. Fans of the series may look past these faults or even embrace them, but some of them are hard to get past, and can define the entire experience.

--------------

**Game Revolution** - Peter Paras - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/battlefield-1) (XB1)

>Battlefield 1 isn’t just a great addition to the series, it arrives as a thunderous explosion that will impact the military shooter space for many years to come. A memorable single player campaign in an FPS is a rarity, and it delivers that without compromise. Operations is an instant classic for multiplayer lovers, while the other modes will keep you invested, supported by fantastic gameplay. Visually breathtaking and fun to play, DICE has delivered an instant classic that has raised the bar.

--------------

**GameSpot** - Miguel Concepcion - [9 / 10](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-1-review/1900-6416555/) (XB1, PC)

>EA’s shooter franchise goes back in time to the end of the imperial age with spectacular results in both its single and multiplayer experiences.

--------------

**GamesRadar+** - David Roberts - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.gamesradar.com/battlefield-1-review/) (XB1, PC)

>Battlefield's tried and tested multiplayer feels wonderfully at home in the WW1 setting, and the solo campaign tells interesting - if historically lightweight - stories.

--------------

**GamingTrend** - Mike Pearce - [95 / 100](http://gamingtrend.com/reviews/back-and-better-than-ever-battlefield-1-review/) (PC)

>Like a bayonet charge to the face, Battlefield 1 packs a serious punch, and it looks damn good while doing it. With a revamped, emotionally charged campaign, the single-player experience is, without a doubt, the franchise’s best. The multiplayer combines solid classics and unbeatable mechanics with new modes that fit the WWI setting brilliantly. Could this be the Battlefield to end all Battlefields? It just might.

--------------

**Hardcore Gamer** - Kevin Dunsmore - [4 / 5.0](http://www.hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=231147) (XB1)

>Putting to rest any qualms about the World War I setting, Battlefield 1 is a true Battlefield game with everything you’ve come expect from the franchise.

--------------

**Metro GameCentral** - Unknown - [8 / 10](http://metro.co.uk/2016/10/17/battlefield-1-review-the-shooter-to-end-all-shooters-6196404/) (XB1)

>The First Word War setting feels a little less daring than you might’ve hoped, but as a complete first person shooter package this is one of the best of the generation so far.

--------------

**NZGamer** - Ben Wilson - [8.4 / 10.0](http://nzgamer.com/reviews/2517/battlefield-1.html) (PS4)

>While the campaign’s experimental short stories may just be the most interesting thing about Battlefield 1, this is not a niche experience to accurately portray the history its borrowing. This is a Battlefield game, and that means World War One in the Battlefield style, with all the compromises therein.

--------------

**Polygon** - Arthur Gies - [9 / 10.0](http://www.polygon.com/2016/10/17/13303292/battlefield-1-review-xbox-one-ps4-playstation-4-pc-windows) (XB1)

>Small issues aside, Battlefield 1 marks an impressive, risk-taking reinvention for the series. That the multiplayer is as good and distinctive as it is is less surprising than a campaign that takes a difficult setting and navigates it with skill and invention. The end result is a shooter than succeeded far beyond my expectations, and one that exists as the best, most complete Battlefield package since 2010.

--------------

**Telegraph** - Kirk McKeand - [4.0 / 5 stars](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/battlefield-1-review/)

>Usually I would not recommend a Battlefield game on the strength of its single-player, but Battlefield 1’s War Stories have toppled this tradition like a well-placed mortar to a windmill.

>On the whole, though, Battlefield 1 is a fantastic game. If you want a shooter that replicates the epic scale of two armies at war, or one that prioritises tactical thought over twitchy trigger fingers, this is the FPS for you.

--------------

**TheSixthAxis** - Stefan L - [8 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/17/battlefield-1-review/) (XB1, PC)

>Operations mode is the standout addition to the multiplayer, bringing together the behemoths, the destruction, the hellish screams of people charging into the fight. I do wish that the single player had been able to push on and draw more from that excellent opening, but stepping back to the First World War helps to give Battlefield 1 a refreshing and invigorating veneer to the game, and it’s lost none of the series’ explosive gameplay in the process.

--------------

**ThisGenGaming** - Josh Perrins - [9 / 10.0](http://thisgengaming.com/2016/10/14/battlefield-1-review-xbox-one/) (XB1)

>Ultimately, Battlefield 1 goes back to move forward and it’s a delight to experience. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a video game that dares to throw you into the horrors of a Great War and yet Battlefield 1 feels modern, something one might assume to be oxymoronic considering the setting of 1914-1918. Whilst other FPS games this year and in previous years have switched to jet-packing and wall-running, Battlefield 1 feels like its reinvigorated a genre that I had grown tired of in recent years. By making this risky decision, DICE and EA actually have proven you don’t need to go futuristic in-order to reinvigorate a genre. In fact, DOOM as well as Battlefield 1 this year prove to me that sometimes reverting back to the basics can be one of the most refreshing experiences possible.

--------------

**USgamer** - Kat Bailey - [Review-In-Progress](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/battlefield-1-xbox-one-review-in-progress-day-1-the-cavalrys-here) (XB1)

>In general, I think there's a lot to like about Battlefield 1. It retains the best parts of the series—the vehicles, the scope, the weightiness of the action—while shaking things up just enough to be interesting. Whenever I start to grouse about it being too modern, I see a horse gallop past or a biplane fly overhead and I smile. This is Battlefield as it should be: a chance to dive into a series of historical battles and have fun.

--------------

**Xbox Achievements** - Dan Webb - [90%](http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/battlefield-1/review/) (XB1)

>DICE should be praised for taking the risky move and turning back the clock with Battlefield 1, both in terms of the era and the direction for the franchise. Very often these moves can cripple a series, but thankfully for us – and DICE – it’s a move that has revitalised the franchise.

--------------

**Stevivor** - Ben Salter - [9.5 / 10](http://stevivor.com/2016/10/review-battlefield-1/) (XB1, PC)

>Battlefield 1 is the definitive Battlefield game not only of this generation, but this decade. By focusing on moments and emotional realism, rather than a continuous campaign, it’s crafted the best single-player experience of any Battlefield game, and backs it up with stellar multiplayer. Operations is the best addition in years, and the returning favourites suit the World War I theme to a tee.

>I’m glad to say that it’s a refreshing take on a single player campaign and its refined and robust multiplayer mode has thoroughly impressed me. Simply put, Battlefield 1 is the best Battlefield game yet, and I can’t wait to see what direction DICE and EA take the series from here.

>Warfare has never looked so good. Battlefield 1 is brutally beautiful, even if you're just admiring the emotional power of a shelled-to-shit landscape that was once a picturesque village.

>DICE has done something impressive with the War Stories, even if they are a little cheapened by the repetitive death of the multiplayer.

>We love the new Operations and War Pigeons multiplayer modes too, as they add some much needed variety to our usual rotation of Rush and Conquest.

>It's easily the best Battlefield we've had in years.

**Attack of the Fanboy** - William Schwartz - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/battlefield-1-review/) (XB1)

>A shift to shorter, more intimate stories alongside the impressive visual and audio presentation make Battlefield 1 one of the more enjoyable single player shooters from DICE in quite some time. While multiplayer is far less ambitious than we've seen in years prior, it still scratches that itch for Battlefield fans who crave the chaos and cooperation that only this series can deliver.

**PlayStation Lifestyle** - Mike Ashworth - [8.5 / 10](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2016/10/18/battlefield-1-review-new-old-ps4/) (PS4)

>Battlefield 1 shows progress for the franchise in single-player storytelling, evolving from an experience that should probably be skipped over in favor of multiplayer, into something that everyone should play through at least once. Though there’s only a short amount of time spent with each set of characters, they carry the story well. What truly sells it for me, however, are the epic moments contained within every chapter. Of course, multiplayer is the real home of these epic moments, with “Only in Battlefield” experiences making Battlefield 1‘s player versus player modes unique and fun to play. Though the “1” in its name may officially stand for the Great War, it could also represent the rebirth of a franchise that took a bit of a beating with Battlefield 4, went down an awkward path with Hardline, before finally rising as the Battlefield title that simply all shooter fans must buy.

**GamingBolt** - Bill Smith - [8.0 / 10](http://gamingbolt.com/battlefield-1-review) (XB1)

>Battlefield 1 manages to break up the monotony of current first person shooter trends by offering a fresh setting. Despite some issues, it offers one of the better Battlefield campaigns and a robust multiplayer component that will keep you hooked up for quite a while.

**Destructoid** - Zack Furniss - [Review-In-Progress](https://www.destructoid.com/review-in-progress-battlefield-1-393881.phtml) (PC)

>I feel crazy saying this, but I actually want more of these stories. I hope that the Battlefield 1 season pass doesn't just include multiplayer content, but instead has more glimpses into the various lives of combatants throughout World War I. If EA DICE can maintain this quality, I'd like to see more of this documentary-style approach to storytelling.

>Special super-powered boats and airships also appear in Conquest mode, but only when one side dominates the other. As a result, they're not as impactful. In practice, they feel like a Mario Kart blue shell thrown at a racer who's already on track to winning a race handily. Conquest is a purely symmetrical battle, where both sides have equal shots at claiming and maintaining turf control. In the beta, super-powered craft turned the tide too severely and too often in Conquest; now, it's just a light perk to help way-behind teams have a little more hope in at least racking up XP or knocking out badge-related goals.

>Battlefield 1 is a bold reinvention of the Battlefield series, proving not only that DICE aren't afraid to move in brave new directions, but also that they have a genuine understanding of what makes a Battlefield game really tick. Series veterans will feel immediately at home in the multiplayer, while those scared by the online battlefields will find the campaign, while short, provides a great diversion and a good way to ease yourself into the chaotic world of Battlefield.

> Mr. Iwata is gone, but it will be years before his impact on both Nintendo and the full video game industry will be fully appreciated. He was a strong leader for our company, and his attributes were clear to most everyone: Intelligence, creativity, curiosity and sense of humor. But for those of us fortunate enough to work closely with him, what will be remembered most were his mentorship and, especially, his friendship. He was a wonderful man. He always challenged us to push forward…to try the new…to upset paradigms—and most of all, to engage, excite and endear our fans. That work will continue uninterrupted.

I say hello and we discuss our flights to LA, the weather, etc. As always, he's upbeat, engaging and full of energy - a charmer. That's what I'll remember the most, his charm. He was the smartest, most important  guy in the room, but he always made me feel welcome. Thank you, Mr. Iwata for making me a part of the Nintendo family. Your warmth and compassion was genuine, and inspirational. I hope I can, in some small way, help Nintendo, and the gaming industry live up to your legacy. I'll do my best to smile and have fun.

*Translation*:
> “No matter the farewell, I think the most appropriate thing to say is “we”ll meet again.” We are friends so we”ll see each other again. There is nothing strange about saying it. Yeah. We’ll meet again.

> Even if you didn’t have the chance to put into words how sudden it was going to be, how far you’d be traveling, or how you went much earlier than expected, I know you went wearing your best.

> You always put yourself second to others no matter what, helping anyone who needed it whenever they needed it. You were that kind of friend. Although you may have been a little selfish for the first time ever by taking this journey.

> The truth is though that I still don’t believe any of it. I feel like I am going to receive a message from you inviting me out to eat at any moment. I wouldn’t mind if you were to ask me like always if I had some free time. If you did, I’d ask you as well.

> Still, “we’ll meet again.” It would be great to hear from you whenever and wherever; I’ll being calling to you too. I’ll call if I have something to discuss or I want to tell you a great new idea I’ve had.

> We’ll meet again.

> Then again, you’re here with me now.”

*[Alternate translation](http://tinycartridge.com/post/123976316807/earthbounds-creator-reflects-on-iwatas-passing)*:
> When I’m parting with a friend, regardless of the circumstances, I find it best to just say, ‘See you later.’ We’ll meet again. After all, we’re friends.

> That’s right—nothing unusual about it. I’ll see you later.

> You went on a trip far, far away, even though it was planned for many years from now. You wore your best outfit and said 'Sorry for the short notice,’ though you didn’t say it out loud.

> You always put yourself last, after you’d finished helping everyone else. You were so generous as a friend that this trip might be your very first selfish act.

> I still can’t grasp what’s happened. It feels like I could still get a light-hearted e-mail asking me out to lunch at any moment—after you’ve made sure lunch wouldn’t disrupt my schedule, of course.

> You can invite me out whenever you want. I’ll invite you, too.

> So for now, let’s plan on meeting again. You can call me up whenever you like, and I’ll give you a call, too. I still have a lot to talk to you about, and if I come up with any particularly good ideas, I’ll let you know.

> So let’s meet again.

> No–I suppose we’re already meeting. Right here, right now.

> People fighting over turns to actively talk about the deceased.
> Small episodes, some mischieves you've done together, some stupid habits, mistakes made, small adventures you had, songs you sang in Karaoke, food you've eaten together, and places you've visited.
> I would love a funeral with such never-ending fond memories.
> For sometime, even now, I have been wanting to live as a person whose funeral would just be one of these.

> I've had such talks with Iwata-san on many occasions, and together with Miyamoto-san and secretary W-san, we had talked about late Yamauchi-san.
> We have spent time in hot spa talking about him, a time where we were filled with both happiness and sadness at the same time.
> Leaving your name in history is just a small bonus.
> It's far more important to your life to have left all the fond memories and lasting impressions.

> In reality, the funeral for a public person isn't a place for such common person, so it will have to be held in a separate venue.
> But, in such a wonderful place, I'm saddened that Iwata-san won't be able to attend.

> A gathering to talk about not grand nor great, but a ""good man"", praising, teasing, and cherishing their memories.

> Currently, I'm doing it alone.
> My wife who has frequently went to lunch together would join me sometimes, but I still feel lonely.
> Iwata-san was suppose to be attending my funeral.

As a hard worker and a virtuous person, he always quickly derived balanced summaries and proposals. I thought that he was the best possible leader. I pray for his happiness in the next world.

> Even though it’s an abnormal day, and I’m an in abnormal state of mind, I went to work as normal and am continuing development as normal. This would be what Mr. Iwata would have wanted, after all. I will do what I must

> Life is always just a succession of regrets.

> Iwata-san, thank you for everything. I don’t typically look up to a lot of people, but I really respected you. I would always be thinking from afar just how amazing of a person you are.
It’s cliché to say this, but please rest in peace.

>I always admired his personal, easy to understand commentary on games in development in his Nintendo Direct. He was an inspiration as a leader of one of the most influential companies in the game industry, who used to make games himself and has always been a gamer. I had a couple of times I had conversations with him at some international industry events, he was always friendly and nice to talk with. I was dreaming someday to have an open exchange of Tweets or to be on a same panel session with him to talk about industry and games we play. I even tweeted when I was leaving for E3 this year with #iwatter as I saw he started tweeting Nintendo E3 news with the hashtag. I have always respected Nintendo's games, how they are super accessible and polished for everyone to play and enjoy, and I understand Iwata-san was one of the key individuals to have kept that high quality standard across all Nintendo titles. I just wish he will rest in peace. Thank you for all your work for the better game industry.

I consider myself lucky to have called him a good friend for over two decades. All of us at Activision Blizzard send his wife and children and the entire Nintendo family our most sincere condolences.

> Satoru Iwata, was a true visionary, his influence on the games industry is beyond question. Without him we may never have seen Earthbound or experienced the Pokemon games in the ways we appreciate today. Under his guidance Nintendo produced arguably the most disruptive systems we have ever seen, the Wii and DS proved being brave and forward thinking can lead to great success. He was and will remain one of the corner stones that make this industry so amazing. He will be sorely missed.

> I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Iwata during the ""Iwata Asks"" for Xenoblade Chronicles. He had a very direct look, and I can never forget the way he smiled and so attentively listened to what was being said. I'm grateful for all the works he has produced. Thank you, Mr. Iwata. May you rest in peace.

**[Tony Harman](https://www.facebook.com/tonyharman?fref=nf)** - President, nWAy Inc and former Director of Development & Acquisitions, Nintendo of America
> I have known Mr. Iwata for about 25 years and his passing today caught me by surprise. I remember the day Mr. Iwata became the President of Nintendo Company Limited (NCL). I was in Kyoto at Nintendo's headquarters, and Mr. Iwata came out of a meeting room with Mr. Miyamoto and looked in shock. Mr. Miyamoto had a grin on his face and said ""Tony, did you know Mr. Iwata was just named President of NCL by Mr. Yamauchi? I said ""really? So what does that mean"". Mr. Miyamoto's response was ""That means Iwata gets to buy our drinks from now on"" and Mr. Iwata responded, ""Mr. Yamauchi didn't even tell me if I got a raise"". I said ""I am pretty sure you got a raise and can afford to buy our drinks from now on"". I have know Iwata since he was head of development at Hal Laboratories who made the Kirby series of game, Mario Golf and Super Smash Bros (and tons more games). I will really miss his pure intentions to always make a great game.

> I am beyond heartbroken to hear about the passing of my friend Satoru Iwata. He was a gamer, a developer and a champion for our medium. RIP 

> I first met Satoru Iwata at TGS in 2005 when I interviewed him for G4. He spoke in Japanese and showed off the Nintendo Wii controller. So at the end of the interview, after the cameras were off, he turned to me and started speaking in English. ""Geoff, I really liked out interview. I can tell you are a gamer so I wanted to show you something."" He turned the controller sideways. He held it like an NES controller with D-pad and the A B buttons. He smiled, I think to hint at Virtual Console. 

> I'll always remember that. I felt a great connection with him then, he wanted gamers to know that Nintendo would always think of us. He was such an honorable man. His smile said so much. He was and is one of us. He loved game, and wanted to make the world a better place with them. And he did.

**[Press Start](https://opencritic.com/outlet/491/press-start)** - [Brodie Gibbons](https://opencritic.com/critic/3662/brodie-gibbons) - [8 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/xbox-one/2020/09/03/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-pure-fun/)

>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a one-way ticket to the turn of the millennium. It's a complete, beautiful love letter to not only Tony Hawk himself as an icon but to a time when both the series and the sport of skateboarding itself were most pure and fun. As a bundle, and with the multiplayer providing even more longevity, this game offers unrivalled value.

>THPS1+2 is probably the best remake I've played. It perfectly captures the core fun of the original games, including the original soundtrack and skaters, and brings it up to modern standards with surprisingly few tweaks outside of the graphics and audio work. Perfect for long time loyal fans, and a great starting point for newcomers.

>No matter which way you spin in, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 is an excellent remake from top to bottom. The levels look great, the soundtrack is nostalgic yet modern, and the gameplay brings you back to sitting on your living room floor late at night playing with friends.

>As a recreation it highlights how good the original games were for their time. Challenging, original, addictive and damn fun to play.

-------------

**[The Outerhaven Productions](https://opencritic.com/outlet/335/the-outerhaven-productions)** - [Karl Smart](https://opencritic.com/critic/2157/karl-smart) - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.theouterhaven.net/2020/09/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/)

>Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1+2 is the remaster that gets just about everything right. The graphics are amazing, the skaters are here from both games alongside some newer skaters from the modern era, the gameplay is lifted from the best games in the series with the option to customize things to your liking, and the music brings that good wave of nostalgia that the series is famous for. Though there are some missteps here and there, the remaster is right up there in the realm of the best remasters available for any video game. Working nostalgia into a very satisfying recreation of two of the best games in the genre is something that will have you smiling from game to game.

>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+ 2 is a labour of love and an ode to the series' glory days. Every inch of the game has been perfectly restored and updated for modern consoles and it's an absolute delight to play from start to finish. This is a must-buy for skateboarders, gamers and everyone else in between.

>Vicarious Visions has proved that Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater was more than just a product of its time, and that – like skating itself – it has every chance of penetrating the mainstream once again.

**Eurogamer** - [Phil Iwaniuk](http://opencritic.com/critic/722/phil-iwaniuk)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-16-south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review)|*Ubisoft tightens up the systems but can't quite replicate the sparkle for this fun but flawed RPG sequel.*|PC
**Rock, Paper, Shotgun** - [Fraser Brown](http://opencritic.com/critic/453/fraser-brown)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/10/16/wot-i-think-south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/)|*With the combat system and the way it’s actually trying to make a point with its exploration of social issues, The Fractured But Whole does improve on its predecessor in some ways, but it quickly starts to coast, relying too much on familiarity to get by. It’s still South Park, so we get to summon a drug-fueled Kyle’s dad to conduct a Heavy Metal bombing raid, and if you go into the back room of a church, yes, priests will try to have sex with you — it can be horrible and hilarious, just not as often as it needs to be to fill 15 hours.*|PC
**Ars Technica** - [Sam Machkovech](http://opencritic.com/critic/2302/sam-machkovech)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/south-park-fractured-but-whole-review-emphasis-on-the-fractured/)|*For all of the content I really enjoyed in SP:FBW, I am jealous of those of you who get to watch someone play this game instead of slaving through it yourselves. There's $60 of content here, undoubtedly, but I'd happily pay Ubisoft for a slimmed-down non-interactive version with the unfunny game portions trimmed out. I loved how well Obsidian nailed the balancing act of ""make it funny and make it interesting to play"" last time. Ubisoft deserves credit for trying something new but not for how badly they stumbled.*|PC
**Kotaku** - [Jason Schreier](http://opencritic.com/critic/972/jason-schreier)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://kotaku.com/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-the-kotaku-review-1819633743)|*It is a well-crafted game, and like its predecessor, it feels like an authentic recreation of South Park the show. It is full of shocking, outrageous moments. But it can also feel sanitized, like a Disney-fied rendition of a cartoon that won many early fans over with how crappy and explicitly un-Disney it was.*|
**AngryCentaurGaming** - [Jeremy Penter](http://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter)|Buy ~ [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usr061CaA-o)|*Absolutely a 'Buy', the game is a blast. For me, it is a little better than the prior title, not just in the way it is delivered, but also in just the subject matter. I felt that they nailed the superhero parts; I get that some people won't like those, but for me this was so much fun. I will easily return to this as soon as I have the open time.*|
**Gamers Heroes** - [Captain Camper](http://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)|100 ~ [10 / 10](http://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/ps4-reviews/south-park-fractured-whole-review-ludicrously-fantastic/)|*South Park: The Fractured But Whole has everything fans would hope for, and is a well crafted turn-based RPG to boot. Put simply, this is the funniest game I have ever played, period.*|PS4
**The Daily Star** - [Dom Pepplatt](http://opencritic.com/critic/253/dom-peppiatt)|100 ~ [5 / 5](http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/652643/South-Park-The-Fractured-But-Whole-review-the-funniest-RPG-of-the-generation)|*Parker and Stone once mentioned that the Ubisoft videogames may be the future of the South Park world - if The Fractured But Whole is what we can expect of the franchise going forward, it’s safe to say the legacy of the show is in remarkably good hands.*|
**TrueAchievements** - [Mark Hollinshead](http://opencritic.com/critic/1696/marc-hollinshead)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.trueachievements.com/n30162/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review)|*The Stick of Truth was a brilliant example of how South Park can be translated into the medium of video games while still retaining its essence. The Fractured but Whole has managed to do that again and take it even further.*|XB1
**Daily Mirror** - [Aodhan Gregory](http://opencritic.com/critic/4399/aodhan-gregory)|100 ~ [5 / 5 stars](http://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/south-parks-the-fractured-whole-11355632)|*Whether you're a die-hard fan of South Park or you're looking to lose yourself in a massive role-playing game, The Fractured But Whole seems like it will have a little something for everyone.*|
**DualShockers** - [Taylor Lyles](http://opencritic.com/critic/1386/taylor-lyles)|95 ~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.dualshockers.com/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc/)|*All in all, South Park: The Fractured But Whole is a fantastic game. While there are some minor flaws, I couldn't put my controller down. Aside from being one of my personal favorite games of this year, it also holds a special place in my heart as one of the best Ubisoft games I have ever played. If you are a fan of the TV series, as well as The Stick of Truth, I highly recommend purchasing this game; it is well worth your time, and it is worth every penny of its purchase price.*|XB1
**VGCulture HQ** - [Morgan Lewis](http://vgculturehq.com/author/morgan/)|95 ~ [9.5 / 10](http://vgculturehq.com/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review-ps4/)|*South Park: The Fractured But Whole takes the best elements of the show and improves upon them in an interactive format. It’s easily one of the best games of the year, and a must-play game for everyone.*|PS4
**COGconnected** - [Alexander Thomas](http://opencritic.com/critic/1943/alexander-thomas)|94 ~ [94 / 100](http://cogconnected.com/review/south-park-fractured-whole-review/)|*South Park: The Fractured But Whole has been well worth the wait. Building off of the massive success of The Stick of Truth, Fractured But Whole has an incredibly satisfying combat system that leaves you constantly eager for the next fight, exemplary and natural dialogue from everyone in town, and a truly epic soundtrack. With a fully customizable character, loads of pop culture references, and political satire that might hit a little too close to home, this is exactly the game we hoped it could be. In terms of a raunchy, dirty, filthy, cuss-filled RPG that pushes the boundaries of comedy, no one does it better, and I mean that in the best possible way.*|PS4
**Pittsburgh Post-Gazette** - [Max Parker](http://opencritic.com/critic/1351/max-parker)|93 ~ [9.3 / 10](http://communityvoices.post-gazette.com/arts-entertainment-living/the-game-guy/item/41125-south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review)|*""TFBW"" has everything a good sequel should have. It builds on the groundwork laid by original while staying true to the classic and hilarious South Park tone. The original was no slouch, especially considering it was the first RPG set in the South Park universe, but ""TFBW"" surpasses it in every way. It's not just the best South Park game. It's one of this year's best RPGs.*|
**Hardcore Gamer** - [Chris Shive](http://opencritic.com/critic/1804/chris-shive)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5](http://www.hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=274699)|*South Park: The Fractured But Whole could be summarized as The Stick of Truth with better combat featuring superheros instead of swords and sorcery.*|PS4
**Pure Playstation** - [Jason Frye](http://opencritic.com/critic/2552/jason-frye)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://pureplaystation.com/review-south-park-fractured-whole-ps4/2017/10/)|*South Park The Fractured But Whole builds on the previous game to provide better mechanics with a greatly improved UI to power its superhero-inspired story. Outside a few individuals, your favorite South Park residents are well represented in a crazy, fully explorable world that only South Park could create.*|PS4
**GamingTrend** - [Mike Pearce](http://opencritic.com/critic/2133/mike-pearce)|90 ~ [90 / 100](http://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/blazing-buttholes-south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review/)|*In the end, I'm struggling to find negative things to say about this game. From start to finish, South Park: The Fractured But Whole had me in stitches. It's the perfect of blend of smart and silly. It is magnificent and absurdly ridiculous in a way that only South Park can pull off. It's the best possible excuse to laugh about everything and everyone you know you're not supposed to.*|PC
**GamesRadar+** - [Sam Prell](http://opencritic.com/critic/653/sam-prell)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.gamesradar.com/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review/)|*South Park balances ample fan service with gameplay that stands on its own merits and an engaging story. It won't make you a fan if you weren't one already, but it's hard to imagine a better-realized adaptation.*|
**Cerealkillerz** - [Gabriel Bogdan](http://opencritic.com/critic/3388/gabriel-bogdan) - *German*|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://cerealkillerz.org/south-park-die-rektakulaere-zerreissprobe-ps4-review-geht-definitiv-in-die-annalen-ein/)|*South Park: The Fractured but Whole comes with the quality you'd expect from the show and besides some repetitive Riddles it delivers a solid South Park Experience and an entertaining story. Tactical RPG Fans will miss some challenge and some more thought out upgrade mechanics would've been nice but it's definitely the funniest game of the year.*|PS4
**PS Site** - [Adam Grochocki](http://opencritic.com/critic/3747/adam-grochocki) - *Polish*|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.pssite.com/recenzje/2706/recenzja-south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-ps4.html)|*A brilliant satire on modern pop culture with an engaging story and a great sense of humor. That's the newest South Park game for you.*|PS4
**Gadgets 360** - [Rishi Alwani](http://opencritic.com/critic/1352/rishi-alwani)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/south-park-fractured-but-whole-review-1763589)|*Minor technical issues aside, the stellar combat, engaging narrative, and quirky humour make this 30 hour romp through the quiet mountain town of South Park, Colorado, worth checking out. Particularly if the TV show's brand of humour gels with you. It's a marked improvement over South Park: The Stick of Truth in almost every way.*|XB1
**Geek Culture Podcast** - [Dean James](http://opencritic.com/critic/595/dean-james)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://www.geekculturepodcast.com/2017/10/16/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review/)|*With 21 years of being on the air, South Park: The Stick of Truth was the first game that truly captured the spirit of the series and that is continued with near perfection in South Park: The Fractured But Whole. Even if you never got around to playing The Stick of Truth, South Park: The Fractured But Whole is the very epitome of South Park at the very top of its game.*|XB1
**Wccftech** - [Kai Powell](http://opencritic.com/critic/1914/kai-powell)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://wccftech.com/review/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/)|*Much like a shart, The Fractured but Whole continues to surprise as the game of superheroes goes darker and cruder than anything else the kids of South Park have experienced.*|PS4
**TechRaptor** - [Andrew Otton](http://opencritic.com/critic/2007/andrew-otton)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://techraptor.net/content/south-park-fractured-whole-review)|*South Park: The Fractured But Whole is South Park at its best backed up by gameplay that would stand on its own in any other game.*|PS4
**PowerUp!** - [Matthew Mancherster](http://opencritic.com/critic/4562/matthew-manchester)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://powerup-gaming.com/2017/10/16/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review/)|*South Park: The Fractured But Whole really is an impressive game. Offensive and in your face, but impressive none the less.The gameplay and exploration are fun and fulfilling in all ways video game. The story is insane and keeps you entertained for the entirety of the playthrough.*|
**EGM** - [Ray Carsillo](http://opencritic.com/critic/165/ray-carsillo)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review/)|*The new combat mechanics add tons of depth and strategy to the experience, and new exploration abilities really give Fractured But Whole an overall deeper RPG feel. The game is also absolutely hysterical; if you love the humor of South Park in general, then Fractured But Whole is a must have.*|XB1
**GearNuke** - [Khurram Imtiaz](http://opencritic.com/critic/2810/khurram-imtiaz)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://gearnuke.com/south-park-fractured-whole-review-ps4/)|*South Park: The Fractured But Whole feels just like an animated feature from the TV series with the same lewd jokes, satirical social commentary along with an improved combat and exploration system.*|PS4
**Attack of the Fanboy** - [Kyle Hanson](http://opencritic.com/critic/597/kyle-hanson)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5 stars](http://opencritic.com/critic/597/kyle-hanson)|*South Park: The Fractured But Whole doesn’t remake the wheel that The Stick of Truth crafted so well. The first game made for a near perfect South Park experience, with bare bones RPG elements to make it all work. This sequel does mostly the same, only tinkering with a few things, making for a different but just as enjoyable final product. Those who don’t find South Park’s particular brand of comedy endearing will likely find little to enjoy here, but if you loved the first game, you’ll love this new one just as much. And if you’re a South Park fan who hasn’t played either, then you need to fix that ASAP.*|XB1
**PlayStation LifeStyle** - [Chandler Wood](http://opencritic.com/critic/178/chandler-wood)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2017/10/16/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review-ps4/)|*Despite these couple of technical misgivings, South Park: The Fractured But Whole is another interactive journey into the minds of Matt Stone and Trey Parker. I quite literally felt like I was playing the show for the 15 hours that I spent in South Park–not surprising, given that the first game met that uncanny caliber of delivering a near perfect recreation. If easily offended, chances are you’ve already written off South Park, and chances are even higher that you aren’t reading this review. Surrounding the fart jokes and fourth graders who love to say fuck a lot, there is a brutally intelligent comedic commentary on many aspects of modern society. It’s something that South Park has always been great at, and something that translates incredibly well to interactivity. Where the first game made a believer out of me, The Fractured But Whole had me farting falling in love with South Park all over again.*|PS4
**IGN Italy** - [Alessandra Borgonovo](http://opencritic.com/critic/3960/alessandra-borgonovo) - *Italian*|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://it.ign.com/south-park-scontri-di-retti-ps4/132151/review/south-park-scontri-di-retti-la-recensione)|*A sequel that every true fan should play.*|PS4

**Game Informer** - [Kyle Hilliard](http://opencritic.com/critic/1040/kyle-hilliard)|88 ~ [8.8 / 10](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/south_park_the_fractured_but_whole/b/playstation4/archive/2017/10/16/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-game-informer-review.aspx)|*The Fractured But Whole is a worthy follow-up to one of the best video game adaptations of a TV show ever made. It has consistent humor, a story with a satisfying pay-off, and a fun new combat system*|PS4, XB1, PC
**GamesBeat** - [Mike Minotti](http://opencritic.com/critic/1057/mike-minotti)|88 ~ [88 / 100](https://venturebeat.com/2017/10/16/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review-better-combat-saves-the-day/)|*The grid-based combat adds the layer of complexity that The Fractured but Whole needs to stand out from its excellent predecessor. You'll still need to be a fan of the show to get the most of this. But if you are a South Park aficionado, The Fractured but Whole is another hilarious and fun game that captures the spirit of series.*|PS4
**Do You Even Game Bro?** - [Kieron Verbrugge](http://opencritic.com/critic/4101/kieron-verbrugge)|88 ~ [8.8 / 10](http://www.doyouevengamebro.net/south-park-fractured-whole-review/)|*South Park: The Fractured but Whole goes beyond being just a fan’s wet dream, and is a legitimately great RPG in its own right.*|XB1
**AusGamers** - [Steve Farrelly](http://opencritic.com/critic/1378/steve-farrelly)|88 ~ [8.8 / 10](https://www.ausgamers.com/games/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/review/)|*It’s for both South Park fans and RPG fans, but finding that balance between the two audiences might prove a bit tricky. However, if you’re a fan of both you’re in for a challenging and investment-heavy treat. The game’s polish was worth the wait. It’s combat is much-improved and the story -- if you care -- has some wonderful peaks across a South Park consistent delivery of social commentary alongside all those aforementioned dick, shit and fart jokes. Boss battles are always engaging and when you do finally gain those abilities to tackle all of the Town’s secrets, it culminates in a fantastic and excellent experience. You just need to have the patience to sit on the pot for a while, before you can decide to shit and move on (to awkwardly mess up an old saying).*|XB1
**RPG Fan** - [Michael Sollosi](http://opencritic.com/critic/1946/michael-sollosi)|88 ~ [88 / 100](http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/South_Park_The_Fractured_but_Whole/index.html)|*If you find yourself in the center of the Venn diagram of ""people who enjoy South Park"" and ""people who enjoy turn-based RPGs"" then South Park: The Fractured but Whole and its predecessor The Stick of Truth are both must-play video games.*|PS4

The Marvel vs DC parody delivers regular laugh-out-loud moments with only a few faltering gags, and the combat soon evolves into something much more complex and interesting than The Stick of Truth's simple system. Navigation and repetition of some of its simple puzzle mechanics drag a little, but it's otherwise an excellent South Park game that's also a strong RPG.*|PS4, XB1, PC

While it is very similar to South Park: The Stick of Truth, and just as much fun, the theme change from medieval fantasy to comic book superheroes makes this feel different and new. In the end the game may be funnier than it is fun, but it's still a good time.*|XB1
**Atomix** - [David Berrones](http://opencritic.com/critic/4301/david-berrones) - *Spanish*|82 ~ [82 / 100](http://atomix.vg/review-south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/)|*South Park: The Fractured but Whole has a more polished combat system than the first game, but it still has some of it's basic flaws that makes it feel monotonous. Either way, you'll enjoy it the most if you're a fan of the animated show. The plot is intelligent, irreverent and with a few surprises. Although it lacks a few epic moments.*|XB1
**Shacknews** - [Brittany Vincent](http://opencritic.com/critic/281/brittany-vincent)|80 ~ [8 / 10](http://www.shacknews.com/article/101722/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review-bigger-longer-and-uncut)|*Besides very minor issues, The Fractured But Whole's main problem is its reliance on familiarity with material outside the game. All the excellent cameos, self-references and a lot of plot points are dependent on players having at least a passing familiarity with the TV show. However, if you like South Park and video games (or just South Park), The Fractured But Whole is a must-have title, and improves on The Stick of Truth in every way.*|
**Worth Playing** - [Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus](http://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus)|80 ~ [8 / 10](http://worthplaying.com/article/2017/10/16/reviews/105670/)|*All in all, South Park: The Fractured But Whole is a solid follow-up to the original game. It doesn't change too much, but the new combat system is an improvement over the original, and it retains the same sense of irreverent humor and love for the franchise as the first game. TFBW is a solid RPG on its own merits, and fans of South Park will find a ton to love here. The only thing that drags it down is feeling a bit too similar to the first game despite the differences, and some of the humor can fall dangerously flat. It's a fun, solid, and well-made licensed title that captured the good and bad of South Park while managing to craft an enjoyable gaming experience. What more can fans ask for?*|PS4

**Easy Allies** - [Michael Damiani](http://opencritic.com/critic/1432/michael-damiani)|80 ~ [4 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NcKcUjq6nc)|*It’s clear that The Fractured But Whole has a few issues that could have been ironed out prior to release, which is surprising given the game’s delays. However, like The Stick of Truth before it, this game absolutely nails the look and feel of the show. Overall it’s a slightly weaker effort than its predecessor, but it is still one of the funniest games out there. [Written](https://easyallies.com/#!/review/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole)*|PS4
**GameSpot** - [Miguel Concepcion](http://opencritic.com/critic/1065/miguel-concepcion)|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review/1900-6416788/)|*Ubisoft's follow-up to the Stick of Truth shines with a rewarding combat system wrapped around South Park's distinct brand of humor.*|PS4, XB1, PC

One of the good episodes, mind you, that's more about the kids interacting with each other than politics. Though it drags at times, The Fractured but Whole carries a sweet, twisted charm that makes it hard to resist if you're similarly twisted. It's still not recommended for anyone who never found the show funny to begin with, though.*|PS4

The fact that this is an RPG that plays really well and has a solid and surprisingly deep battle system is just the icing on the cake.*|XB1

The Fractured but Whole becomes the perfect experience if we are fans of the TV show and, at the same time, we want to explore the city and fight in hard (but accesible) fights. With a new turn-based combat system, the game becomes closer to the Fire Emblem style, which makes it deeper.*|PS4
**Twinfinite** - [Ed McGlone](http://opencritic.com/critic/77/ed-mcglone)|80 ~ [4 / 5](http://twinfinite.net/2017/10/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review/)|*Despite some noticeable issues, South Park: The Fractured But Whole is a must-play for fans of South Park. There's no experience like playing through a massive episode of South Park where the hero of the story is you. The superhero angle really lands, and is an excellent wrapping for the story this time around.*|PS4
**The Game Fanatics** - [Colin Stevens](http://opencritic.com/critic/4574/colin-stevens)|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://thegamefanatics.com/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review-bigger-longer-and-uncut/)|*South Park: The Fractured But Whole is a success, warts and all. Both as a game, and as an extension of the South Park universe, it shines. It mostly nails both low-brow humor and fairly insightful social critique seamlessly. It clocks in at 20+ hours, and while short for an RPG, it’s the perfect length for South Park, feeling like a high quality extended episode of the show itself. All while improving on the foundation by The Stick of Truth. If you’ve never liked South Park’s humor or turn-based games, The Fractured But Whole might not be for you. But if you’re a fan of the series and lighthearted RPG’s, it’s pure crass and crude entertainment from start to finish.*|

It's not without issue, but fans of South Park will enjoy this as much as the first.*|PS4
**Giant Bomb** - [Dan Ryckert](http://opencritic.com/critic/661/dan-ryckert)|80 ~ [4 / 5 stars](https://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review/1900-772/)|*Parker, Stone, and Ubisoft deliver with a bigger, longer, and better follow-up to The Stick of Truth.*|XB1

From a gameplay perspective, it’s infinitely better than it was in the previous outing, but as a piece of entertainment, The Fractured But Whole simply doesn't measure up to The Stick of Truth. There's no censorship this time, which is good, but it almost feels like the whole thing got self-censored somewhere along the way.*|XB1
**Impulsegamer** - [Lyla Saudi](http://opencritic.com/critic/2090/lyla-saudi)|80 ~ [4 / 5](http://www.impulsegamer.com/south-park-fractured-whole-review/)|*The Superhero context and Civil War setting between rival superheroes is excellent and I especially liked how there are modern references to online and social media.  And while the game presents a slick RPG experience, dynamic combat, and plenty to explore and do, the focus on more generic fart jokes and lack of depth of South Park ‘history’ jokes leaves the game feeling more video game generic, and less South Park specific.*|XB1
**Player.One** - [Andrew Whalen](http://opencritic.com/critic/2343/andrew-whalen)|75 ~ [7.5 / 10](http://www.player.one/south-park-fractured-whole-review-120875)|*South Park: The Fractured But Whole is consistently engaging, with an impressive new combat system and fun environmental puzzles to solve with your superpowered allies. As a celebration of South Park, it’s absolutely unparalleled. But The Fractured But Whole is so polished, so well-done and well-acted, so effortlessly identical to the show, that it’s a little disappointing it mostly reconfigures the hits.*|
**Polygon** - [Philip Kollar](http://opencritic.com/critic/1496/philip-kollar)|70 ~ [7 / 10](https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/16/16481094/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review-ubisoft)|*At the beginning of this review, I outed myself as someone who's not a huge South Park fan, but I've watched enough of the show to understand that this is its modus operandi. It foregrounds loud, over-the-top, “edgy” humor, and it backgrounds surprisingly thoughtful character arcs. South Park: The Fractured But Whole matches the show's strange mix of intentions; it is totally aligned in that way. And in that way, it provided the perfect reminder for why the show (and, to a lesser extent, this game) aren't for me.*|PS4, XB1, PC
**Metro GameCentral** - [Adam Starkey](http://opencritic.com/critic/1368/adam-starkey)|70 ~ [7 / 10](http://metro.co.uk/2017/10/16/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review-bigger-longer-uncut-7003134/)|*A surprisingly deep and customisable role-player, wrapped in an enjoyable but unremarkable episode of South Park.*|PS4
**Daily Dot** - [AJ Moser](http://opencritic.com/critic/1794/aj-moser)|70 ~ [3.5 / 5 stars](https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/south-park-fractured-but-whole-review/)|*For fans, there are plenty of surprises to uncover and tons of references to even the most obscure episodes of the show. Thanks to a strong level of personalization coupled with South Park's distinct atmosphere, The Fractured But Whole makes wandering around the faithfully recreated and detailed map of the town a constant delight.*|
**GameSpace** - [Blake Morse](http://opencritic.com/outlet/464/gamespace)|70 ~ [7 / 10](https://www.gamespace.com/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/review/)|*With all that said I’m a firm believer that humor is subjective and I’d be willing to admit that you could have different tastes and find this game to be way more hilarious than I did. But I also think that I’ve been a fan of South Park for a long, long time and played the crap out of Stick of Truth, so it’s not like I didn’t want this game to be good. So maybe you play it and you laugh and I’m totally cool with that. But for me, this feels like an unfinished symphony that could’ve used a few more punch ups before performance.*|PS4
**Video Gamer** - [Colm Ahern](http://opencritic.com/critic/577/colm-ahern)|70 ~ [7 / 10](https://www.videogamer.com//reviews/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review)|*The longer South Park: The Fractured But Whole went on, the less I laughed. Exploring the mountain town, however, is a delight, and the battles are a marked improvement on the original's combat.*|PS4
**PCWorld** - [Hayden Dingman](http://opencritic.com/critic/1180/hayden-dingman)|70 ~ [3.5 / 5 stars](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233207/gaming/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review.html)|*Bugs aside, The Fractured But Whole is another successful translation of South Park to video games. Conceptually I still think Stick of Truth was stronger—it managed to mock fantasy video games as much as the fantasy genre itself. Fractured But Whole is undoubtedly a better experience though, with deeper combat, the same engaging exploration, and a more cogent story. Also, you can manipulate time with your farts. That’s pretty great.*|PC
**Game Revolution** - [Paul Tamburro](http://opencritic.com/critic/472/paul-tamburro)|70 ~ [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/351599-south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review-the-difficult-sequel)|*Ultimately, South Park: The Fractured But Whole is still a polished RPG that die-hard fans of the animated series will love. However, while its combat system has been greatly improved, its failure to provide the same belly laughs as The Stick of Truth, the lack of variety in its locations and its mundane puzzle-solving make for a disappointing follow-up. I enjoyed my time with The Fractured But Whole, and it's clear that a great deal of effort went into its development, but after this I'm not so sure that I'd want to revisit South Park a third time.*|PS4
**Slant Magazine** - [Justin Clark](http://opencritic.com/critic/1331/justin-clark)|70 ~ [4 / 5 stars](https://www.slantmagazine.com/games/review/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole)|*The grand total of all this is a game with a thorough understanding of the social issues it chooses to address but is too sneering and cynical to actually care about them. It would much rather be playing Marvel Heroes in the streets with friends, which would be fine if we were dealing with a game made by a preteen for other preteens, not the most visible, privileged satirists on the planet, who've proven multiple times they're capable of doing both.*|PS4
**Cheat Code Central** - [Lucas White](http://opencritic.com/critic/3680/lucas-white)|60 ~ [3 / 5](http://www.cheatcc.com/ps4/rev/southparkfracturedbutwholereview.html)|*Sometimes, you have no choice but to end a review wondering who the game is for.*|

>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a good, standard Metroidvania that can be very fun especially for those who are looking for a fresh Iga-Vania experience, though some shortcomings like weak story and bad character design prevent it from getting level with some recent Meteoidvania titles.

>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is everything that was great about Igarashi's Metroidvania titles all rolled into one, and feels like it will be as timeless a game as Symphony of the Night.

>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a worthy follow up to the Castlevania games that many grew up with in terms of its exploration, but lacks some much-needed polish in the combat and animation department to truly shine as a modern gem

-------------

**[Destructoid](https://opencritic.com/outlet/90/destructoid)** - [Chris Carter](https://opencritic.com/critic/431/chris-carter) - [8 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-557357.phtml)

>Bloodstained is occasionally frustrating, refreshingly open, and as promised, wholly Castlevania. Hopefully some polish is on the way for Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night as to not alienate folks who are new to the genre, but as any Castlevania fan knows, partial jank comes with the territory.

>Aside from a few script malfunctions and some odd enemy behavior at points, this is a perfect Metroidvania game. If you are a fan of the genre, a fan of Castlevania, a fan of Metroid, or just a fan of 2D platformers in general, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up.

>If you're into post-Symphony of the Night Castlevania, you will find with Bloodstained : Ritual of the Night what you wanted. It doesn' have the name or the same setting, but the feeling and the atmosphere are the same, with some very generous content and a lot of nods to the Konami series. It could have been a lot more polished wisually speaking, felt more of like a game of this era, but how can we be frustrated to get what Koji Igarashi and his team were expected to do ?

>At the outset of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night I could see the castle that would be the major setting for the game. In the distance, even just the sight, I knew there would be an immensity to this game. The quest that Miriam, our protagonist, was on would be daunting and hard fought. Most of all, I could tell a great amount of passion and care went into the creation of Bloodstained.

>Overall, there is little wrong with Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. Some of the sections have a trial and error feel, meaning you might lose and that will cost you progress, though the overall game achieves what it wants. As a fan of those games, I got a similar impression of this as I did with Castlevania: Harmony of Despair. If you're up for looking around every corner, work on your moves and invest in the story, it's hard not to see the value of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.

>After four years of development time, Koji Igarashi has created the game that fans have craved for years. It’s a love letter, not so much to Castlevania itself but to the fans that helped him distance from publisher Konami. Ritual of the Night is not a perfect game, but it’s a bloody good game. If you’re craving for a new Metoridvania, or IGA-Vania, then this is definitely a title to put on your shelf… or digital library.

>A sprawling and beautifully executed monument to the Castlevania titles of old,  Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night feels like a promise delivered for fans of not just the series, but intricately structured action adventures too. The king has returned.

>Bloodstained is the real deal. A true successor to Castlevania that fans and newcomers will easily sink their teeth into.

**[The Games Machine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/497/the-games-machine)** - [Daniele Dolce](https://opencritic.com/critic/4728/daniele-dolce) - *Italian* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-recensione/)

>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is not a bad game but it is disappointing, a metroidvania all too anchored in the past that doesn't really add anything new to the genre that Koji Igarashi himself contributed to create. Beyond the bland execution and the continuous plagiarism of Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow, Bloodstained is plagued by too many problems, especially in terms of combat and the hitbox system, preventing an enjoyable gaming experience. It hurts to say this, but there are too many better alternatives to Bloodstained on the market. We expected a lot more than this from Igarashi-san.

**Release Date: May 13th, 2016**

[GamesRadar - 5/5](http://www.gamesradar.com/doom-review/)

>Intelligent, involved, and relentlessly exhilarating, now, just as in '93, the most exciting FPS around is a game called Doom

[Gamespot - 8/10](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-review/1900-6416432/)

>Many shooters chase the thrill Doom delivers, but few are as potent in their execution. It captures the essence of what made the classic Doom games touchstones of their day, and translates it to suit modern palates with impressively rendered hellscapes and a steady influx of tantalizing upgrades. Doom is the product of a tradition as old as shooters, and while it's not the model to follow in every case, modern shooters could learn a thing or two from Doom's honed and unadulterated identity.

[Destructoid - 9/10](http://www.destructoid.com/review-doom-361942.phtml)

>Now all I'm hoping for is the sequel that this is a little too set up for. I'm hoping it goes the Diablo route and lets me go to a heaven dimension to blast some weird, fu.ked-up angels. Uh, sorry. I've been playing too much Doom. I'm going to go rip up a steak or something.

[Shacknews - 9/10](http://www.shacknews.com/article/94706/doom-review-like-hell-you-will)

>That a first-person shooter like Doom exists in 2016 is shocking. Its levels are vast and intricately designed, its gameplay diverse and joyful, its toolset robust. Multiplayer is its weak link, but the adaptability of SnapMap is more than enough to offset that.

[GameInformer - 88/100](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/doom/b/playstation4/archive/2016/05/17/doom-review.aspx)

>Driven largely by its successful single-player campaign, Doom is a welcome return to form for the genre-defining franchise. By sticking to time-worn traditions in all the right places and deftly employing some modern flourishes, id has rediscovered what made this demon slaying series so successful. Multiplayer and SnapMap don’t reach the same heights, but shooters fans shouldn’t miss this bloodthirsty romp through hell.


[PC Gamer - 88/100](http://www.pcgamer.com/doom-review/)

>With Doom’s campaign, id Software found a sweet spot nestled somewhere between nostalgia and modernity that celebrates the pulpy sheen of big-budget shooters and resurrects an intense, simplified focus on the shooting itself. Doom sticks a bit too close to home to reinvigorate the genre, but it’s a reminder that FPS games aren’t limited to stop and pop corridors and political melodrama. It’s a reminder that sometimes a controlled, crafted appeal to base desires—going fast, flying high, and swift, tongue-in-cheek demon justice—are more than enough.
88/100

[IGN - 7.1/10](http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/doom-review-2)

>Doom is a tale of two very different shooters (and one quirky creation tool). The single-player campaign's reverent worship of the series' roots results in an old-school run-and-gun shooter which feels like imitation Doom, a cover of an old hit which nails all the right power chords but isn't exactly transformative. The multiplayer's attempts to borrow from the new to reinvigorate the old results in an experience which won't satisfy either school of thought. SnapMap, meanwhile, is a blend of weird and simple and endearing.


[Jimquisition - 9/10](http://www.thejimquisition.com/doom-review/)

>With Doom, id has delivered a highly polished, utterly shameless Hellbound hecatomb that confidently swaggers into the world with gaudy fervor. It’s huge, it’s preposterous, and it’s absolutely bloody majestic.

[LazyGamer - 9/10](http://www.lazygamer.net/review/doom-review-riding-shotgun/)

>DOOM is unrepentantly old school. It’s gore porn to the max, a ballet of bullets and blood that I can’t get enough of. Satisfyingly brutal, solid and most importantly, fun.

[Polygon - 85/100](http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/18/11706108/doom-review-PC-xbox-one-PS4)

>Doom struggles somewhat to finish what it starts, and for a franchise that practically created what we understand as shooter multiplayer 22 years ago, its largely flavorless multiplayer is surprising. But on the whole, as a new interpretation of one of gaming's most formative, difficult to pin down cyphers, id has done a pretty great job in making something that feels familiar and fresh, and, most importantly, pretty damned fun.

[Digitally Downloaded - 5/10](http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2016/05/review-doom-sony-playstation-4.html)

>People will be talking about the first two Doom games for decades more – those two games may well be remembered as true classics of the gaming medium a century down the track. This Doom won’t. This new Doom is terrible...Like the greedy organisation that unleashes hell on Mars, this is the product of exploitation; the developers at ID Software and Bethesda are playing with fire in treating a property as valuable as Doom this way.

>I really don’t like this new Doom.....While I’m not much of a fan of shooters these days.....

It takes the best bits of the series and improves them, putting together a story that feels personal despite its huge ambition and featuring what may be the best Dishonored protagonist yet. If Death of the Outsider ends up being the closing chapter for the Dishonored series, then it is a truly fitting conclusion.*|PS4
**TrustedReviews** - [Jordan King](http://opencritic.com/critic/2100/jordan-king)|90|[9 / 10](http://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/dishonored-death-outsider)|*Death of the Outsider is a fantastic addition to the Dishonored universe that once again brings the broken city of Karnaca to life. Exploring Arkane Studios’ beautifully realised world feels fresh once again thanks to Billie Lurk, a morally ambiguous heroine with a flexible repertoire of skills that are a joy to experiment with. Death of the Outsider achieves more in terms of content and narrative than many games strive for, which is a fascinating achievement considering its meagre price tag.*|PS4

**SA Gamer** - [Garth Holden](http://www.opencritic.com/critic/2217/garth-holden)|90|[9 / 10](https://sagamer.co.za/review-dishonored-death-outsider-ps4)|*Death of the Outsider keeps enough of what makes you love Dishonored in the first place, while a new protagonist and power set keep things fresh and exciting to explore and discover.*|PS4
**TechRaptor** - [Anson Chan](http://opencritic.com/critic/2617/anson-chan)|85|[8.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/content/dishonored-death-outsider-review)|*An excellent game that delivers an above average amount of gameplay for its cost, giving you the freedom to utilize an interesting set of powers to track down and kill a god. Beautiful environments and varied objectives more than make up for changes to the Chaos mechanic from previous games in the series.*|XB1
**GameSpace** - Robert Baddeley|85|[8.5 / 10](https://www.gamespace.com/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider/review/)|*If you’re looking for a fresh take in a familiar setting and enjoyed either, or both, of the Dishonored games I feel no guilt in fully recommending the $30-dollar price tag for this stand-alone game.*|

This standalone expansion doesn’t revolutionize the series but instead does something more important, navigating the familiar to bring everything to a satisfying conclusion.*|PS4

If this is the end for Dishonored, then it’s gone out in style.*|PS4

Even though it's a shorter and slightly shallower game, there are some exciting new abilities and interesting changes to the energy system, and the freedom from consequences of Chaos further encourage experimentation and freedom. All in all, it's a worthy end to the story that began five years ago.*|XB1, PC

It's a decent finale with a solid central character. But it makes little attempt to try anything new, a sign that all the best ideas are likely going into whatever comes next.*|PC

Across six or so hours, this standalone indulgence doesn’t add much truly new, instead relying on tweaks of its existing formula . But it delivers strong missions and an excuse to continue skulking around this fabulous and hugely atmospheric world.*|PS4

By giving the player new powers to play with, Arkane forces us to redefine the way we play the series. As usual, each level offers multiple possibilities, but this time the lethal or pacifist approach does not change the world we live in.*|PS4

**Metro GameCentral** - [GameCentral](http://opencritic.com/outlet/75/metro-gamecentral)|80|[8 / 10](http://metro.co.uk/2017/09/20/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-review-end-of-the-story-6940963/)|*The Dishonored saga comes to an elegant, if not entirely satisfying, end with a spin-off adventure that is almost as good as its full price predecessor.*|PS4
**GamingBolt** - [Will Borger](http://opencritic.com/critic/1205/will-borger)|80|[8 / 10](http://gamingbolt.com/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-review)|*Death of the Outsider's story never lives up to its promise, but strong mechanics, good gameplay, and a fascinating world pull it through.*|PS4
**We Got This Covered** - [Edward Love](http://opencritic.com/critic/2496/edward-love)|80|[4 / 5 stars](http://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/dishonored-death-outsider-review/)|*If this truly is is the concluding chapter in the series, Dishonored exits with a fitting goodbye. Death of the Outsider takes a syringe to the magic formula, siphons up the good bits and leaves any and all excess behind.*|PS4
**TrueGaming** - [خالد العيسى](http://opencritic.com/critic/3268/-) - *Arabic*|80|[8 / 10](https://www.true-gaming.net/home/350386/)|*A thrilling story and a satisfying play time at just half price.*|XB1
**Hardcore Gamer** - [Spencer Rutledge](http://opencritic.com/critic/2839/spencer-rutledge)|80|[4 / 5](http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2017/09/20/review-dishonored-death-of-the-outsider/272867/)|*Dishonored: Death of the Outsider is a fitting resolution to a familiar story. Billie Lurk is an excellent character to showcase the underside of a world already known but with plenty of mystery left in it. Combining elements from all previous Dishonored titles while dialing back certain aspects makes for a fresh experience that fans will feel comfortable in.*|PS4
**GameMAG** - [xtr](http://www.opencritic.com/outlet/459/gamemag) - *Russian*|80|[8 / 10](http://gamemag.ru/reviews/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider)|*Dishonored: Death of the Outsider is one of the most emotional and well-developed games of the year, which offers a huge number of opportunities for solving problems, and a really interesting exploration aspect.*|PS4
**Oyungezer Online** - [Utku Çakır](http://opencritic.com/critic/3618/utku-ak-r) - *Turkish*|75|[7.5 / 10](http://oyungezer.com.tr/haber/50825-dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-inceleme)|*Although it fails on the signature aspects of Dishonored series such as level design and choices; Death of the Outsider has to be a game that series' fans want to play.*|PC
**PlayStation LifeStyle** - [Ahmed Mohamed](http://opencritic.com/critic/542/ahmed-mohamed)|70|[7 / 10](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2017/09/19/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-review-ps4/#/slide/1)|*Death of the Outsider is just more Dishonored in about every way, but it could have been a unique experience with a few additions like the aforementioned inclusion of mini-bosses and some co-operative missions with Daud. But I enjoyed my time slinking through its world and saying goodbye to an underappreciated franchise that opens the door for an all new direction if the story is to be continued.*|PS4
**3DNews** - [Артем Терехов](http://www.opencritic.com/outlet/531/3dnews) - *Russian*|70|[7 / 10](https://3dnews.ru/958903)|*Dishonored: Death of the Outsider faced a difficult task — to tie loose ends, and bring the Kaldwin era of the franchise to an end. Unfortunately, this high-profile target slipped away from it, but this standalone expansion is a good Dishonored experience nonetheless. Although a little shorter and shallower than you might expect.*|PC
**Gamers Heroes** - [Captain Camper](http://www.gamersheroes.com/author/captaincamper/)|60|[6 / 10](http://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/dishonored-death-outsider-review-murder-without-morality/)|*Dishonored: Death of the Outsider could have easily been great for value DLC, but as a stand-alone game for $30, some players may feel a little cold after the 6-7 hours of game time. There is an Original Game+ mode that adds new abilities to the characters of Dishonored 2, but if you've had your fill of reliving past glories, you'll probably get through the game in a solid nights' play.*|PS4

**Ars Technica** - Sam Machkovech - [No Verdict](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/08/sonic-mania-review-a-rich-return-to-16-bit-form-despite-potholes/)

>Sonic fans should buy. Curious onlookers should try.

--------------

**Attack of the Fanboy** - Jelani James - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://aotf.com/reviews/sonic-mania-review/)

>Sonic Mania doesn't necessarily mark Sonic's return to his glory days, but there is still much to love about this game and it can easily serve as a foundation for the future of the series if the Sonic Team chooses to continue in this direction.

--------------

**CGMagazine** - Remington Joseph - [8.5 / 10.0](http://www.cgmagonline.com/reviews/sonic-mania-sega-gameplay-playstation-4-review/)

>Sonic Mania earns its spot next to the titles released during Sonic's golden era

--------------

**COGconnected** - James Paley - [86 / 100](http://cogconnected.com/review/sonic-mania-review-just-remember/)

>Every stage is a carefully-crafted explosion of looping paths and intricate patterns.

--------------

**Destructoid** - Chris Carter - [8 / 10.0](https://www.destructoid.com/review-sonic-mania-453928.phtml)

>Sonic Mania is short but sweet. It even functions as a proper Sonic 4 if you don't count the episodic Sonic 4 (remember that one?). As long as the same team is in charge I can easily deal with one of these every few years or so while Sega tries to strike Sonic Adventure gold again and again with their 3D iterations.

--------------

**DualShockers** - Azario Lopez - [9 / 10.0](http://www.dualshockers.com/sonic-mania-review-ps4-switch-nintendo/)

>From the beginning to the end, I couldn't seem to put Sonic Mania down. One playthrough, without collecting all the Chaos Emeralds took me about six hours, I never said I was the fastest Sonic player. Sonic Mania has helped me rediscover what it was I loved about Sonic when growing up and it took me back to a time where I could just pick up a game and have fun. This if for Sonic fans everywhere and it will not disappoint.

--------------

**Eurogamer** - Edwin Evans-Thirlwell - [Essential](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-08-14-sonic-mania-review)

>1992 is alive and well. Christian Whitehead and team turn in a beautiful rewrite of the 16-bit Sonic games with all-new stages.

--------------

**Game Informer** - Brian Shea - [8.5 / 10.0](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/sonic_mania/b/xboxone/archive/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-game-informer-review.aspx)

>Sonic Mania succeeds in paying homage to the classic '90s entries that so many fans remember fondly, and in the process delivers the best Sonic game in decades

--------------

**Game Revolution** - Matt Utley - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/344907-sonic-mania-review-a-faster-masterful-remaster)

>Like the Kevin Smith version of A New Hope I imagine almost daily, Sonic Mania is a game made by fans, for fans. And that's not a bad thing. Newcomers may be turned off by the intermittent difficulty spikes, but others may finally understand why many childhoods were spent looking for a kid who had a Sega Genesis.

--------------

**Gameblog** - Angel Davila - *French* - [9 / 10](http://www.gameblog.fr/tests/2812-sonic-mania-ps4)

>Sonic Mania is a solid game that reminds us how amazing in terms of design were 16-bit episodes. We can say this game is unarguably a new classic for the blue hedgehog and that it has to become a reference for the future titles of the franchise.

--------------

**GameCrate** - Nicholas Scibetta - [8.5 / 10.0](http://www.gamecrate.com/reviews/review-sonic-mania-delivers-its-promise/16906)

>Sonic Mania is a wonderful blend of classic Sonic and new ideas, and should serve as an example of the great things that can happen when game companies embrace fan creators. There's no reason Sonic Mania shouldn't be followed by multiple sequels that continue its remixing magic.

--------------

**GamesBeat** - Mike Minotti - [93 / 100](https://venturebeat.com/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review-sonics-best-game-in-over-two-decades/)

>Sonic's best game in over two decades

--------------

**GameSpew** - Richard Seagrave - [90%](http://www.gamespew.com/2017/08/sonic-mania-review/)

>This is Sonic just as you remember, but bigger and undoubtedly better. Is it the best Sonic game? That's hard to say as it comes down to personal preference with regards to stages etc., but one thing is for sure, Sonic Mania is likely to be at the top of many Sonic fans' lists.

--------------

**GameSpot** - Matt Espineli - [9 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-mania-review/1900-6416729/)

>Sonic Mania is both an evolution of the series' iconic formula and the best Sonic game ever made.

--------------

**God is a Geek** - Gary Bailey - [8 / 10.0](http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/sonic-mania-review/)

>Sonic Mania is both fluid and fun, and reminds us all of what a Sonic game should be. This is a game by Sonic fans, for Sonic fans.

--------------

**Hobby Consolas** - Rafael Aznar - *Spanish* - [93 / 100](http://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-sonic-mania-ps4-xbox-one-switch-pc-159796)

>Christian Whitehead deserves an ovation for bringing back a fast hedgehog who had been injuried for a long time. Sonic Mania is a worthy heir to the amazing five 2D platformers the porcupine starred on Mega Drive.

--------------

**IGN** - Heidi Kemps - [8.7 / 10.0](http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review)

>Sonic Mania is the classic throwback longtime series fans have been clamoring for.

--------------

**IGN Spain** - Miguel Ángel Escudero - *Spanish* - [8.5 / 10.0](http://es.ign.com/sonic-mania-ps4/122074/review/sonic-mania-analisis-para-ps4-one-switch-y-pc)

>A great return to the 2D platformer's roots.

--------------

**Kotaku** - Heather Alexandra - [No Verdict](http://kotaku.com/sonic-mania-the-kotaku-review-1797819939)

>Sonic Mania clearly articulates Sonic's true appeal: Sonic is pure joy, a spinning ball of fun blazing a trail towards the next adventure.

--------------

**M3** - Percy Oropeza - *Swedish* - [8 / 10](http://m3.idg.se/2.1022/1.686925/sonic-mania)

>Sonic Mania is an almost perfect mix between new ideas and the same gameplay from the Sonic games on Mega Drive. A must have for any Sonic fan.

--------------

**Metro GameCentral** - GameCentral - [9 / 10](http://metro.co.uk/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review-by-the-fans-for-the-fans-6851515/)

>A touching, and highly playable, labour of love by fans that understand Sonic The Hedgehog better than Sega ever has in the last 20+ years.

--------------

**Nintendo Insider** - Ryan Janes - [9 / 10](http://www.nintendo-insider.com/sonic-mania-review/)

>Sonic Mania is a true love letter to the blue hedgehog's 16-bit days, developed by a team that you can tell have put everything they have into making sure that it not only lives up to fan expectations but gamers in general. And, while there is certainly plenty to be gained here if you're a Sonic enthusiast, Sonic Mania is an excellent standalone platformer in its own right, too, and one that will hopefully open the door to more retro-inspired ventures for some of SEGA's older IPs.

--------------

**NintendoWorldReport** - Jared Rosenberg - [No Verdict](http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/44628/sonic-mania-switch-review-in-progress)

>Sonic Mania is a delightful return to the 2D platforming style that first made the hedgehog a star. The love from the development team for 16-bit Sonic is evident in every moment of the game. Fans of classic Sonic must buy this game, but the excellent level design, music, and graphics will please all people who enjoy a well-thought-out sidescroller.

--------------

**PlayStation LifeStyle** - Jowi Meli - [8 / 10.0](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review-ps4/)

>Overall, Sonic Mania succeeds a lot more than it stumbles.

--------------

**PlayStation Universe** - Neil Bolt - [8.5 / 10.0](http://www.psu.com/review/33769/sonic-mania-review-ps4)

>Sonic Mania successfully takes Sonic back to the formula that saw him become a big deal to begin with. That means it does bring along the flaws in that design as well, but there's no denying this is as good as the Blue Blur has been for a long time.

--------------

**Polygon** - Arthur Gies - [7 / 10.0](https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/14/16142230/sonic-mania-review-ps4-xbox-one-switch-pc)

>If more of what Sonic is what you want, then this is very much that, but more, and bigger, and faster. But for me, as someone with fond memories but key criticisms, Sonic Mania seems content to paint over some of the series' problems rather than fix them, making for a game that falls a little short of what might have been.

--------------

**Push Square** - Stephen Tailby - [8 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/sonic_mania)

>Sonic Mania is the best Sonic game in years, and stands proudly alongside its ancestors as a great 2D platformer. The levels, both remixed classics and brand new stages, are broad and a lot of fun to speed through, while more cautious exploration is also rewarding and just as viable. The feeling of playing an old-school Sonic title is spot on and it's filled to bursting with secrets, Easter eggs, and surprises that will delight fans. If you've never enjoyed Sonic games, this certainly won't change your mind, but anyone with an affinity for the Blue Blur's seminal Mega Drive series can rest assured that this is more than worth your time.

--------------

**Rice Digital** - Oscar Taylor-Kent - [5 / 5 stars](http://www.ricedigital.co.uk/sonic-mania-review-a-lessons-from-the-classics/)

>Every new cog in Sonic Mania looks right at home next to the old ones.

--------------

**Slant Magazine** - Jed Pressgrove - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.slantmagazine.com/games/review/sonic-mania)

>At its best, Sonic Mania makes classic zones from past Sonic the Hedgehog games feel unpredictable again.

**Spaziogames** - Francesco Corica - *Italian* - [9 / 10.0](https://www.spaziogames.it/recensioni_videogiochi/console_multi_piattaforma/21221/sonic-mania-la-recensione-del-ritorno-del-porcospino-blu-in-2d.aspx)

>Sonic Mania is the return to the 2D gameplay style that the community has been waiting for a long time, and it's one of the revelations of this year. A game made by fans, for the fans.

--------------

**The Jimquisition** - Jim Sterling - [9.5 / 10.0](http://www.thejimquisition.com/sonic-mania-review-blue-skies-ahead/)

>Sonic Mania is a brilliantly staged celebration of the past that acts as a true sequel to the Genesis line of games.

--------------

**TheSixthAxis** - Dave Irwin - [10 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review/)

>Sonic Mania surpasses the Mega Drive/Genesis originals. It not only incorporates what made Sonic great, but has the inventiveness to shatter what was possible in a 2D platformer. As a nostalgia trip, it sets the bar for what comes next for the modding community. For those unexposed to what made 2D Sonic great, this is still a solid game in its own right and may create new fans in the process. If being this good took ages, it's about damn time.

--------------

**USgamer** - Caty McCarthy - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/sonic-mania-review)

>Sonic Mania is a brilliant return to form for the series' long-time away from traditional 2D games. Even if a few less remixed stages and more new zones would have been a nice change of pace, Sonic Mania's joyful level of ingenuity even in reimagining familiar sights is a testament to some of the franchise's best days.

--------------

**VideoGamer** - Colm Ahern - [7 / 10](http://www.videogamer.com//reviews/sonic-mania-review)

>It took two decades and change, but a team of developers has shown they understand what made the old Sonic games great with Sonic Mania, even if nostalgia is sometimes too much of a driving force.

--------------

**We Got This Covered** - Ken Barnes - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/sonic-mania-review/)

>Sonic Mania is a fantastically well-worked continuation of an iconic franchise and a great reminder of why the Genesis games were so well loved. Everybody who has waited patiently for 20-odd years for Sega to get it right again is in for a treat. Top notch.

--------------

**Xbox Achievements** - Richard Walker - [80%](http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/sonic-mania/review/)

>A beautifully crafted love letter to Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Mania is everything a Sonic game should be and more. I'd be deliriously happy if SEGA carried on making them like they used to; if it carried on making more games like Sonic Mania.

**VideoGamer** - [Alice Bell](http://opencritic.com/critic/1708/alice-bell)|Review-In-Progress ~ [Review-In-Progress](https://www.videogamer.com//reviews/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-in-progress)|*We've still got to do some online testing when the servers are up, but the offline lobby for Dragon Ball FighterZ suggests this is going to be a good 'un. Whether or not you like fighting games or Dragon Ball, extremely dramatic villains and hench dudes with giant hair hurling fireballs at each other (all set to unceasing guitar solos) is kind of inherently enjoyable.*|PS4
**Polygon** - [Jeff Ramos](http://opencritic.com/critic/4250/jeff-ramos)|Review-In-Progress ~ [Review-In-Progress](https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/23/16924526/dragon-ball-fighterz-review)|*With everything I've played so far, Dragon Ball FighterZ made me feel as powerful and unstoppable as one of the series' lauded heroes.*|
**USgamer** - [Mike Williams](http://opencritic.com/critic/299/mike-williams)|Review-In-Progress ~ [Review-In-Progress](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/dragon-ball-fighterz-review)|*What's here is a complete package, with a fighting game that's fun for fans, but still has depth for masters. There's a robust Story Mode, a branching Arcade Mode, and a whole host of characters to learn. Arc System Works has poured a deep amount love for Dragon Ball Z into the game and it shows.*|PS4
**AngryCentaurGaming** - [Jeremy Penter](http://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter)|Buy - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWCudCsL0H8)|*This is absolutely a 'Buy'. As with games like this, if you're into the absolute nitty-gritty, you might want to wait and see how things flush out and how the top level players end up enjoying it, but overall this was a fantastic title and one I will return to again and again and again. It doesn't matter if you're doing the tournament, you're doing the local, or what have you- There is an incredible amount to be offered here and well I would've liked a couple more characters, I think that the DLC will shore most of that up. Also if anything changes when it comes to the online or any other elements, I'll definitely update that in a video*|XB1
**Eurogamer** - [Wesley Yin-Poole](http://opencritic.com/critic/780/wesley-yin-poole)|Essential ~ [Essential](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-01-25-dragon-ball-fighterz-review)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is a fantastic fighting game, and worth playing whether you're into Dragon Ball and fighters or not.*|PS4
**Kotaku** - [Mike Fahey](http://opencritic.com/critic/979/mike-fahey)|Unscored ~ [Unscored](https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-fighterz-the-kotaku-review-1822541455)|*Arc System Works has created the most approachable Dragon Ball game ever, and one of the most accessible fighting games. Fans of either should be overjoyed to welcome newcomers to their ranks, and those newcomers get to experience two of the most accepting and supportive communities in fandom. Everybody wins.*|XB1, PC
**MonsterVine** - [Spencer Legacy](http://opencritic.com/critic/2164/spencer-legacy)|100 ~ [5 / 5](http://monstervine.com/2018/01/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-spirit-bomb-dot-com/)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is one of the best fighting games I have ever played. Everything about FighterZ, from the gameplay to the visuals, is an absolute blast that will please anyone who enjoys Dragon Ball and/or exciting but accessible fighting games. A slightly padded story can’t hold back this immovable force of a fighting game that you need to be playing right now.*|PS4
**Marooners' Rock** - [Mike Robles](http://opencritic.com/critic/2231/mike-robles)|98 ~ [9.8 / 10](http://maroonersrock.com/dragon-ball-fighterz-xbox-one-review/)|*A New Challenger Approaches and it's name is Dragon Ball FighterZ. Bandai Namco and Arc System Works have delivered something astounding and I know that myself, and the FGC are excited to bear witness of what's to come in this game's life cycle.*|XB1
**Cheat Code Central** - [Lucas White](http://opencritic.com/critic/3680/lucas-white)|96 ~ [4.8 / 5](http://www.cheatcc.com/ps4/rev/dragonballfighterzreview.html)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ feels like it hits a sweet spot, retaining the look and feel of a versus fighter while reining in the complexities that make fighting games still so hard to get into. The mechanical streamlining is supplemented with a story mode that is a silly love letter to the license, that takes its time to let the player learn how to play the game while still having fun and enjoying a new story. It’s a full, hearty experience that fans of Dragon Ball will go nuts over, and fighting games on the outside won’t be able to resist diving into either.*|
**CGMagazine** - [Cole Watson](http://opencritic.com/critic/1928/cole-watson)|95 ~ [9.5 / 10](http://www.cgmagonline.com/reviews/dragon-ball-fighterz-ps4-review-super-saiyan-levels-gameplay-presentation/)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is the perfect marriage of source material enriched gameplay and original presentation. Ark System Works has created a fantastic experience that a wide audience of players and passionate fans are sure to enjoy.*|PS4
**Player.One** - [Phillip Martinez](http://opencritic.com/critic/2082/phillip-martinez)|95 ~ [9.5 / 10](http://www.player.one/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-good-bad-score-123482)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ lives up to the hype that manifested from its initial reveal. Its gorgeous art style and movements compliment some really crisp and fluid gameplay that anyone can pick up and enjoy.*|PS4
**MMOGames** - [Nick Shively](http://opencritic.com/critic/64/nick-shively)|95 ~ [9.5 / 10](http://www.mmogames.com/gamereviews/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-ps4/)|*If you enjoy fighting games or are a fan of Dragon Ball then I can't recommend Dragon Ball FighterZ enough. The gameplay is addicting, the visuals are outstanding, and it finally feels like you're fighting in the anime.*|PS4
**PSX Brasil** - [Ivan Nikolai Barkow Castilho](http://opencritic.com/critic/3863/ivan-nikolai-barkow-castilho) - *Portuguese*|95 ~ [9.5 / 10](http://www.ps3brasil.com/analise/1039/)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is an excellent fighting game. It has beautiful graphics that are very faithful to the anime. The gameplay, although simple at first glance, has a depth that can be explored by the most dedicated players. The online mode does not disappoint either, except for the difficulty of playing it with friends. The story mode, despite having a slow start and being unnecessarily too long, is worth checking out. In the end, Dragon Ball FighterZ deserves to be played.*|PS4
**Game Informer** - [Suriel Vazquez](http://opencritic.com/critic/247/suriel-vazquez)|93 ~ [9.3 / 10](http://www.gameinformer.com/themes/blogs/generic/post.aspx?WeblogApp=playstation4&y=2018&m=01&d=26&WeblogPostName=dragon-ball-fighterz-review&GroupKeys=games/dragon_ball_fighterz/)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ seamlessly blends accessibility and complexity, making for a feverishly-paced fighter that makes the learning process gradual and engaging, and gives casual players hours of worthwhile things to do solo and potentially turning fighting game fans on to the world of Dragon Ball.*|PS4
**Hobby Consolas** - [Daniel Quesada](http://opencritic.com/critic/3764/daniel-quesada) - *Spanish*|91 ~ [91 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-dragon-ball-fighterz-ps4-xbox-one-pc-186212)|*We don´t know if FighterZ is the best current fighting game, but it's for sure the most spectacular Dragon Ball game. Don´t let the frantic combats fool you: there are lots of mechanics and tricks to master.*|PS4
**Wccftech** - [Dave Aubrey](http://opencritic.com/critic/1303/dave-aubrey)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-fighterz-super-saiyan-god/)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is possibly the greatest Dragon Ball game of all time, and already one of the best fighting games of the year, if not the best. Great fighting and amazing visuals collide in this excellent anime fighter.*|PS4
**EGM** - [Evan Slead](http://opencritic.com/critic/4097/evan-slead)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/)|*While there have been many fighting games based on the Dragon Ball franchise, Dragon Ball FighterZ marks a modern approach through the means of fast-paced action. From its breathtaking visuals to ease of gameplay mastery, the new fighter is a good stepping stone to expand the fan base of the genre. However, it may not satisfy players who are looking for complexity.*|PS4
**Hardcore Gamer** - [Chris Shive](http://opencritic.com/critic/1804/chris-shive)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5](https://www.hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=287149)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is a rare gem in a sea of licensed games.*|XB1
**Spaziogames** - [Mario Petillo](http://opencritic.com/critic/3758/mario-petillo) - *Italian*|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/recensioni_videogiochi/console_multi_piattaforma/21977/dragon-ball-fighterz-la-recensione-del-picchiaduro-di-arc-system-works.aspx)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is an incredible fighting game, with a rock-solid and spectacular combat-system, and the unique Dragon Ball Universe behind it. Competitive and fun, except for the not so brilliant story mode, is an absolute must-have for both the fans of the saga and the fighting game lovers.*|PS4
**GameSpot** - [Peter Brown](http://opencritic.com/critic/1408/peter-brown)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-in-progress/1900-6416837/)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is a great fighting game and an exciting revitalization of Dragon Ball Z's glory days.*|PS4, XB1
**GBAtemp** - [Krista Noren](http://opencritic.com/critic/1349/krista-noren)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://gbatemp.net/review/dragon-ball-fighterz.708/)|*Dragon Ball Z is a video game franchise that has many beloved entries, from the Legacy of Goku series, to the Budokai and Tenkaichi games. However, these games have always been targeted to its niche fanbase. Dragon Ball FighterZ is different; it's a fighting game that everyone, including veteran DBZ fans and newcomers alike, can enjoy wholeheartedly.*|PS4
**Metro GameCentral** - [GameCentral](http://opencritic.com/outlet/75/metro-gamecentral)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://metro.co.uk/2018/01/22/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-anime-authenticity-7250225/)|*A dream come true for Dragon Ball fans, but also a highly competent fighting game that is a front runner for the best fighter of the generation.*|
**God is a Geek** - [Adam Cook](http://opencritic.com/critic/569/adam-cook)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/)|*An exquisite feeling fighter that is both approachable and deep. Time will tell if it has staying power, but it's the best use of the Dragon Ball Z name in quite some time.*|PS4
**The Digital Fix** - [Jason Coles](http://opencritic.com/critic/4870/jason-coles)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://www.thedigitalfix.com/gaming/content/7596/dragon-ball-fighterz/)|*A fantastic fighting game for newcomers and fans of the genre alike, filled with knowing nods to the fans of the show. Dragon Ball FighterZ is a genuine delight to play and to watch.*|PS4
**PS Site** - [Sebastian Kasparek](http://opencritic.com/critic/3746/sebastian-kasparek) - *Polish*|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.pssite.com/recenzje/2829/recenzja-dragon-ball-fighterz-ps4.html)|*An amazingly beautiful and incredibly fun fighting game for dozens of hours. A spectacular title full of nostalgia – a true homage to the legendary Dragon Ball.*|PS4
**Critical Hit** - [Darren Bonthuys](http://opencritic.com/critic/1229/darryn-bonthuys)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://www.criticalhit.net/review/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-hold-beerus/)|*The definitive Dragon Ball fighting game, bar none. Arc System Works have created a game which walks across many a fine line, blending style with substance and accessibility with reverence for the source material. It's wild, it rocks my dragon and it sets a benchmark for the series that proudly enters the domain of fight game gods.*|PS4
**TrueGaming** - [عمر العمودي](http://opencritic.com/critic/3265/-) - *Arabic*|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://www.true-gaming.net/home/360245/)|*Finally a fighting game with anime licenses that offers a distinctive experience of all elements, one of the best fighting games this generation on consoles with impressive graphics and a style of gameplay that is very entertaining.*|PS4
**Saudi Gamer** - [عصام الشهوان](http://opencritic.com/critic/3299/-) - *Arabic*|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://saudigamer.com/review/dragon-ball-fighterz/)|*A visually stunning game that channels the series it's based on perfectly, with a system that's easy to grasp and challenging to master, and a decent amount of content with only a handful of minor flaws to it.*|PS4
**Do You Even Game Bro?** - [Edward Darling](http://opencritic.com/critic/4284/edward-darling)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.doyouevengamebro.net/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is an awesome game, and whether you’re a fan of the genre or a fan of the series, you’ll find it packed to the brim with stuff to do and things to love. The stunning visuals, enjoyable story and accessible gameplay mechanics have already made it one of my favourite releases of the New Year. Not only has it sparked a competitive spirit within me (which I plan to take online), it’s also inspired me to dig out my old VHS recordings of Cheez TV. On second thought, maybe I’ll just stream it.*|PS4
**GameSkinny** - [Ty Arthur](http://opencritic.com/critic/2872/ty-arthur)|90 ~ [9 / 10 stars](https://www.gameskinny.com/vauh5/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-an-early-contender-for-fighting-game-of-the-year)|*Slick combat, plenty of modes, and the best visual representation of the franchise in a video game yet make Dragon Ball FighterZ a game you definitely want to play!*|PS4
**Shacknews** - [Blake Morse](http://opencritic.com/critic/4573/blake-morse)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.shacknews.com/article/102941/review-dragon-ball-fighterz-goes-super-saiyan)|*This is truly the best Dragon Ball fighter I’ve played since the Super Famicom imports. It’s pure fighting bliss that makes you feel as OP as the characters on the show by adding so much style and flare. Longtime fans and newer fans who may just be familiar with Dragon Ball Super will find something to enjoy here if they’re fans of fighters.*|
**Geek Culture Podcast** - [Dean James](http://opencritic.com/critic/595/dean-james)|90 ~ [9  /10](https://www.geekculturepodcast.com/2018/01/26/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/)|*Taking a mix of their own Guilty Gear or BlazBlue series and combining it with a little of Marvel vs. Capcom and surrounding it with a Dragon Ball coat of paint was just the recipe for Arc System Works with Dragon Ball FighterZ that makes it the game fans of the franchise have truly been waiting for all these years.*|PS4
**LevelUp** - [Luis Sánchez](http://opencritic.com/critic/3296/luis-s-nchez) - *Spanish*|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.levelup.com/Xbox-One/juegos/426312/Dragon-Ball-FighterZ/review)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ balances style and concept very well. It's an easy game for newcomers, but has room for experts in the genre to develop advanced skills. This may be the very best Dragon Ball fighting game to date because it captures, aesthetically and mechanically, the core and most enjoyable aspects of the series that fans have enjoyed for decades.*|XB1
**Slant Magazine** - [Justin Clark](http://opencritic.com/critic/1331/justin-clark)|90 ~ [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.slantmagazine.com/games/review/dragon-ball-fighterz)|*This is a gleaming example of how to craft a fighting game that feels like it has its arms open for everyone to enjoy.*|PS4
**The Games Machine** - [Danilo Dellafrana](http://opencritic.com/critic/3695/danilo-dellafrana) - *Italian*|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/dragon-ball-fighterz/dragon-ball-fighterz-recensione/)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ manages to make every player happy: it's the kind of experience that's deep and challenging, yet at the same time affordable for newcomers. The combat system is a little too focused on the attack, and it's not possible to break combos, but Arc System Works made a remarkable work here, the perfect entry point for everyone who considered Street Fighter V or Guilty Gear too technical and complex.*|PS4
**TheSixthAxis** - [Dave Irwin](http://opencritic.com/critic/316/dave-irwin)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/29/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/)|*2018 is off to a strong start with an Dragon Ball FighterZ early contender for this year's best fighting game.  By shattering some boundaries, Dragon Ball FighterZ has combat that's more than worth getting into, but also a diverse roster and some phenomenal presentation. The Story Mode could have been improved if it were more streamlined, but it's a mere blemish on an otherwise spectacular game.*|PS4
**Push Square** - [Robert Ramsey](http://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/dragon_ball_fighterz)|*Utterly stunning in motion and effortlessly capturing the essence of Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball FighterZ is a masterful video game adaptation. Its combat system is relentlessly entertaining, fusing anime sensibilities with traditional, competitive fighting game mechanics, and its accessible controls allow anyone to get in on the action. Meanwhile, the online portion of the release is robust, and really sets the bar for social interaction when it comes to fighting games. Dragon Ball FighterZ is pretty much the best anime fighting game ever made.*|PS4
**TheSixthAxis** - [Dave Irwin](http://opencritic.com/critic/316/dave-irwin)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/29/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/)|*2018 is off to a strong start with Dragon Ball FighterZ an early contender for this year’s best fighting game.  By shattering some boundaries, Dragon Ball FighterZ has combat that’s more than worth getting into, but also a diverse roster and some phenomenal presentation. The Story Mode could have been improved if it were more streamlined, but it’s a mere blemish on an otherwise spectacular game.*|PS4
**Niche Gamer** - [Brandon Orselli](http://opencritic.com/critic/1210/brandon-orselli)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://nichegamer.com/reviews/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/)|*I was thoroughly impressed with Dragon Ball FighterZ and cannot recommend it enough to both fighting game fans and or fans of the Dragon Ball universe. It may have some minor issues here and there as it just launched, but this is a fighter you cannot pass up.*|PS4
**GearNuke** - [Khurram Imtiaz](http://opencritic.com/critic/2810/khurram-imtiaz)|90 ~ [9 / 10](http://gearnuke.com/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-xbox-one/)|*Dragon Ball FigtherZ is not only one of the best looking fighting game currently on market, it also offers easy to grasp but deep fighting mechanics. Simply put, it is one of the best Dragon Ball fighting game released this generation.*|XB1
**Press Tart** - [Brodie Gibbons](http://opencritic.com/critic/3662/brodie-gibbons)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2018/01/30/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-diverse-accessible/)|*Just like Rocksteady did for Batman, Arc System Works has carried Dragon Ball to the upper echelon, crafting a tag-fighting game that captures not only the series' distinctive style but its spirit. FighterZ stands alongside other versatile, yet accessible, games like Marvel vs. Capcom with ease in what is the best fighting game in recent memory. It's a shame the servers hamstring the experience so badly, rendering the game's online a bit of a mess.*|PS4
**Paste Magazine** - [Holly Green](http://opencritic.com/critic/1883/holly-green)|90 ~ [9 / 10](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/01/dragon-ball-fighterz-is-my-favorite-dragon-ball-an.html)|*This is both the fighting game and Dragon Ball spin-off I never realized I always wanted. The production values are better, and the narrative tension is vastly improved. Given how Dragon Ball FighterZ amps up the drama on existing Dragon Ball storylines, increases engagement by allowing the player to take dialogue sequences at their own pace, and puts a polished, beautiful spin on the old cartoon, this isn't just my favorite Dragon Ball game. It's my favorite Dragon Ball anything.*|PC
**GamePro** - [Michael Cherdchupan](http://opencritic.com/critic/3638/michael-cherdchupan) - *German*|87 ~ [87 / 100](http://www.gamepro.de/artikel/dragon-ball-fighterz-klopperei-der-extraguete,3325038.html)|*Sublime anime-punch-up with scalable, very dynamic combat system that should inspire beginners and professionals alike.*|PS4, XB1
**IGN** - [Mitchell Saltzman](http://opencritic.com/critic/621/mitchell-saltzman)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/22/dragon-ball-fighterz-review)|*Between the accessible auto combos, homing attacks, and simplified command inputs, Dragon Ball FighterZ is an inviting gateway into the world of fighting games for newcomers — whether you're a Dragon Ball fan or not. Those easy controls can open the door to some spammy behavior, but just as often it's satisfying in a way that does right by the Dragon Ball name. Dragon Ball FighterZ has enough depth and complexity to glow as brilliantly as a Super Saiyan.*|
**Areajugones** - [Juan Linares](http://opencritic.com/critic/3449/juan-linares) - *Spanish*|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](https://areajugones.sport.es/dragon-ball-fighter-z/analisis/)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is a very complete fighting game and lived up to the expectations that a saga such as Dragon Ball generates. The essence of Toriyama's franchise is portrayed with great quality in every character and their moves.*|PS4
**Reader's Gambit** - [Ryan Ester](http://opencritic.com/critic/2442/ryan-esler)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](http://www.readersgambit.com/dragon-ball-fighterz-ps4-review/)|*Even as a relatively distant fan of Dragon ball, I was totally invested in Dragon Ball FighterZ.*|PS4
**COGconnected** - [Michael Chow](http://opencritic.com/critic/2117/michael-chow)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](http://cogconnected.com/review/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/)|*Overall, Dragon Ball FighterZ is primed for mainstream success with its popular franchise, low barrier of entry, ease of play, great aesthetics, and fast-paced combat. Not only is the game simply a tight, pick up and play fighter, but it is one that does the source material of Dragon Ball justice. While more characters would have been nice to have, most of the household names of the series are included. Dragon Ball FighterZ is a solid fighting game with a plethora of game modes, and I cannot wait to see the game evolve after launch.*|XB1
**Destructoid** - [Nick Valdez](http://opencritic.com/critic/3483/nick-valdez)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-dragon-ball-fighterz-484392.phtml)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ has the depth more dedicated players will crave, but it doesn't stop itself from being a fun experience for everyone. Much like the series it stems from, the core of the series is based on a simple premise with deeper themes for those who wish to explore it fully. But it's got a lot of filler.*|PS4
**PlayStation LifeStyle** - [Ahmed Mohamed](http://opencritic.com/critic/542/ahmed-mohamed)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2018/01/28/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-rock-dragon-ps4/#/slide/1)|*If you’re looking for a fighter, there is simply nothing better on the market than Dragon Ball FighterZ in terms of what it offers as a 2D, high action brawler. If you don’t see yourself sinking a lot of time into the game, it still might be worth it down the line just to appreciate the level of detail and care that the developers at Arc System Works have so painstakingly put into this project. Regardless, Dragon Ball FighterZ is a worthy addition to the anime’s long-running line of fighter adaptations.*|PS4

**TechRaptor** - [Alex Santa Maria](http://opencritic.com/critic/1994/alex-santa-maria)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/content/dragon-ball-fighterz-review)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is no mere licensed game or anime fighter. Sporting a fan-friendly story mode, a robust online experience and a host of other ways for you and your friends to trade ki blasts, it's clear that Arc have delivered a 2D fighter that's worthy of respect.*|XB1
**PlayStation LifeStyle** - [Ahmed Mohamed](http://opencritic.com/critic/542/ahmed-mohamed)|85 ~ [8.5 / 10](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2018/01/28/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-rock-dragon-ps4/#/slide/1)|*If you’re looking for a fighter, there is simply nothing better on the market than Dragon Ball FighterZ in terms of what it offers as a 2D, high action brawler.

The new fighting system from Arc System Works fits perfectly into the series. It's still open if Bandai Namco will delivery enough content to keep players motivated after the launch of the game but besides a generic story Dragon Ball and Fighting Game Fans will get an amazing game here.*|XB1
**Gameblog** - [Jonathan Bushle](http://opencritic.com/critic/3740/jonathan-bushle) - *French*|80 ~ [8 / 10](http://www.gameblog.fr/tests/2943-dragon-ball-fighterz-ps4)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is undoubtedly the best Dragon Ball Z fighting game ever released. As the old clich' goes, it is easy to pick up and play and hard to master even if the all the characters share the same input. And it must also be pointed out that it's the prettiest anime video game ever made. Dragon Ball fans would do themselves a disservice by missing this game.*|PS4
**Rice Digital** - [Oscar Taylor-Kent](http://opencritic.com/critic/3963/oscar-taylor-kent)|80 ~ [4 / 5 stars](http://www.ricedigital.co.uk/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-ballz-to-the-wallz-fun-ps4/)|*It's the best Dragon Ball fighting game, one of the best looking fighting games in general, and a rare welcome entry point for newcomers to understand what competitive fighting games are all about.*|PS4
**IGN Italy** - [Biago Etna](http://opencritic.com/critic/3493/biagio-etna) - *Italian*|80 ~ [8 / 10](http://it.ign.com/dragon-ball-fighterz-ps4/135897/review/dragon-ball-fighterz-la-recensione)|*Difficult to remain neutral in front of Dragon Ball FighterZ: if on the one hand we have a magnificent and stunning transposition of the anime - technically and artistically really out of parameter - on the other hand we see some unbalances in the roster and a gameplay very difficult to master. This does not deny the title a place of excellence in the beat-em-up Olympus, as well as an unmissable opportunity for all Dragon Ball fans.*|PS4
**GamingBolt** - [Aaron Main](http://opencritic.com/critic/1194/aaron-main)|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/dragon-ball-fighterz-review)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is a truly stunning use of the anime license with a ton of tricks to master.*|XB1
**Digitally Downloaded** - [Matt Sainsbury](http://opencritic.com/critic/1604/matt-sainsbury)|80 ~ [4 / 5 stars](http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2018/01/review-dragon-ball-fighterz-sony.html)|*That Dragon Ball FighterZ is a great fighter there can be no doubt. It's energetic, exciting, fast, and also highly technical.*|PS4
**GameMAG** - [Azzy](http://opencritic.com/outlet/459/gamemag) - *Russian*|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://gamemag.ru/reviews/dragon-ball-fighterz)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ - epic, bright, dynamic and surprisingly friendly fighting game. This is an excellent choice for gatherings with friends.*|PS4
**Attack of the Fanboy** - [William Schwartz](http://opencritic.com/critic/596/william-schwartz)|80 ~ [4 / 5 stars](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is both an incredible game to look at and to play. Arc System Works has done right by the Dragon Ball name giving fans of the source material plenty to be happy about.*|PS4
**Xbox Achievements** - [Richard Walker](http://opencritic.com/critic/679/richard-walker)|80 ~ [80 / 100](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/dragon-ball-fighterz/review/)|*A hugely enjoyable, exciting and eye-wateringly good-looking fighting game, Dragon Ball FighterZ is utterly essential for any and all self-respecting DBZ fans. And even if you're not, you'll still probably get a big old kick out Arc System Works' exuberant fighter.*|XB1
**TrueAchievements** - [Marc Hollinshead](http://opencritic.com/critic/1696/marc-hollinshead)|80 ~ [4 / 5 stars](https://www.trueachievements.com/n31233/dragon-ball-fighterz-review)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is a fitting entrance into the 2D fighting world for the franchise. Combat looks brilliant as you pummel the enemy and watch the vibrant colours fly across the screen, and both casual players and veterans alike will easily get their fill from the accessible controls. The substantial story is also a breath of fresh air, so there is plenty to see and do there. If you aren't willing to use the rest of your time online, however, then you may be wondering where to go next. Regardless, whether you're a Dragon Ball fan or fighting game fan, this a game that will easily satiate your appetite for a long time.*|XB1

**PlayStation Universe** - [Benjamin Shillabeer-Hall](http://opencritic.com/critic/842/benjamin-shillabeer-hall)|80 ~ [8 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/)|*With a varied character roster, stunning graphics and balanced gameplay, Dragon Ball Fighterz is a fantastic entry point for new players, and great fun for fans of the series.*|PS4
**Game Revolution** - [Pau lTamburro](http://opencritic.com/critic/472/paul-tamburro)|80 ~ [4 / 5 stars](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/365079-dragon-ball-fighterz-review-here-comes-a-new-challenger)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ is a must-play for Dragon Ball and fighting game fans alike, with it combining accessible gameplay with a distinctive visual direction that perfectly emulates the franchise it's based on.*|XB1
**Invision Community** - [Aidan Bates](http://opencritic.com/critic/4222/aidan-bates)|80 ~ [8 / 10](http://invisioncommunity.co.uk/2018/01/31/dragon-ball-fighterz/)|*Overall, Dragon Ball FighterZ gets an 8/10, the main gameplay is superb, reaching near the top of my favourite list of fighting games. A good majority of the game feels balanced, with the aesthetic looking gorgeous, even with some minor annoyances with light and shadows being used in the cutscenes*|PC
**Gamers Heroes** - [Casey Scheld](http://opencritic.com/critic/3399/casey-scheld)|70 ~ [7 / 10](http://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/ps4-reviews/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ's rock-solid fighting engine is both accessible and deep at the same time. The paltry selection of modes and repetitive Story Mode somewhat take away from the game, but this is one fighter worthy of any Saiyan warrior.*|PS4
**The Outerhaven Productions** - [Karl Smart](http://opencritic.com/critic/2157/karl-smart)|70 ~ [7 / 10](http://www.theouterhaven.net/2018/01/dragon-ball-fighterz-ps4-review/)|*Dragon Ball FighterZ looks pretty as hell, almost as good as the anime these days. However the game has a serious balancing issue, the company has a serious greed issue. Overall the more you play the game, the less you're going to like it unless you enjoy grinding against people who will combo lock you into hell. Single player gets boring quickly, leaving a terrible online experience. Expect this game to disappear into the next dimension when the next flashy anime-style fighting game arrives.*|PS4

[CVG](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/464814/reviews/review-watch-dogs-delivers-on-its-next-gen-promise-review/) 9/10

> Forget speculation about textures and framerates - Watch Dogs is a bona fide next-gen proposition with a wonderfully told tale at its heart.

***

[Destructoid](http://www.destructoid.com/review-watch-dogs-275336.phtml) 8/10

> Impressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding it back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash. Check out more reviews or the Destructoid score guide. 

***

[Escapist](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/11504-Watch-Dogs-Review-No-Hack-Job?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=articles) 4.5/5

> While the controls are quite basic and a bit more limited than one might hope (exploding things only gets so varied), a significant sense of empowerment is hard to argue with, and the interface is so fluid that even a simpleton can feel like a master hacker. It feels cool, that's for damn sure.

***

[Eurogamer](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-27-watch-dogs-review) 7/10

> It certainly entertains, but mostly through borrowed concepts, and the central notion that could have made it stand out - the hacking - is the most undercooked of all. It doesn't get anything horribly wrong, but nor does it excel at any of the genre beats it so faithfully bangs out. It's good, and yet that always feels like a criticism when a game comes weighed down by this much hype. You won't regret the time you spend in Aiden Pearce's world, but nor will it be saved as a precious memory when you reboot.

***

[Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com/2014/05/27/watch-dogs-review-a-wizard-did-it/) 4/5

> These online invasions are arguably the smartest realization of what Watch Dogs is about: the fear of being violated, and the principle of identity protection. Even when it skews toward bigger actions and questionable bouts of busywork, though, Watch Dogs is a more fluid and modern power fantasy than we're used to.

***

[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2014/05/27/watch-dogs-review-ps4-new-dog-new-tricks/) 8/10

> Like Grand Theft Auto V before it, sometimes it’s not enough to simply be big and well-made. Watch Dogs feels like collection of promising concepts with nothing solid holding them together. Aiden Pearce should have been that something, but instead, he’s just a character meant to sell cool looking hats in collector’s editions. Perhaps that can be rectified in a sequel, but for now, Pearce is pretty big issue, and so is his propensity to kill people in boring, cover-based shooter-y ways.

***

[Game Informer](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/watch_dogs/b/playstation4/archive/2014/05/27/watch-dogs-review-ps4.aspx) 8.5/10

> Watch Dog's story works as a basic revenge tale, and the final few missions provide some gravity to the characters. Ultimately, however, the main draw of any open-world game is the gameplay, and while not perfect, Watch Dog's hacking abilities add an engaging and unique twist to the third-person action. Ubisoft has another deserved hit on its hands, and I look forward to seeing where the new series goes next.

***

[Gamereactor](http://www.gamereactor.eu/reviews/124044/Watch+Dogs/) 8/10

> This is a cast we actually want to see more of. Despite the amalgamation of different franchises here, the IP is strong, the ideas and execution good. Oh, and its use of licensed music, particularly at key moments, betters even GTAV. You should play - or just watch - the game for the Wu-Tang Clan sequence alone.

***

[GameSpot](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/watch-dogs-review/1900-6415770/) 8/10

> Aiden's soul is still locked away, too, even though I spent dozens of hours with him. But while I can't say who Aiden truly is, I can confidently say that Watch Dogs is a lushly produced and riotous game with an uncanny ability to push you from one task to the next, each of which is just as fun as the last.

***

[GameTrailers](http://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/gq1zhv/watch-dogs-review) 8.9/10

> Visuals aside, Watch Dogs has a remarkably well crafted world that feels lively and believable. Aside from overtly hacking someone, you can constantly listen in on conversations just as you walk down the street. You'll see random car accidents, guys looking like idiots playing games on their phone, dudes rapping, or even urinating on the sidewalk. And if you pull out a gun, people will run for their lives.

***

[GiantBomb](http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/watch-dogs-review/1900-644/) 3/5

> Even though I feel its story is often weak and its action isn't that different from other games in the genre, I still enjoyed my time with Watch Dogs. It turns out that the old stuff still works, and the strong-but-standard mission design kept me entertained, most of the time. It's rough around the edges, though, so if you don't settle for anything less than the best, you'll probably be disappointed.

***

[IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/27/watch-dogs-review) 8.4/10

> One-button hacking might be overly simplistic, but it does give you abilities that make playing through Aiden’s story feel powerful and fun. Doing side missions and multiplayer as you make your way through the dark and lengthy story makes it feel like a huge adventure, and stealth options let you play smart if you prefer. Car chases aside, Watch Dogs is fundamentally very well made, and has more than enough unique ideas to make it a great and memorable open-world action game. 

***

[Metro](http://metro.co.uk/2014/05/27/watch-dogs-ps4-review-gta-hacker-city-4740568/) 7/10

> A highly enjoyable GTA clone but one that doesn’t quite have the panache of Rockstar’s best or the inspiration to make the most of its otherwise enjoyable gameplay concepts.

***

[Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/27/5746116/watch-dogs-ps4-xbox-one-review) 8/10

> Other games have nailed a better balance in optional activities and large-scale ambiance, including other games from Ubisoft Montreal itself. But when Watch Dogs focuses on the things it does better than anyone else, it finds an identity worth developing. As a hybrid open-world stealth-action game, it’s in a class by itself.

***

[USGamer](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/watchdogs-ps4-review) 5/5

> Watch_Dogs combines an astonishingly detailed world, a gripping storyline, creative game mechanics, a myriad of missions and activities, and improvisational tactical sandbox gameplay to create a truly next-generation open world game. Phenomenal. No other word for it.\

***

[VideoGamer](http://www.videogamer.com/reviews/watch_dogs_review.html) 7/10

> It's a game that reaches a baseline of enjoyment – and that baseline is fairly high – and doesn't raise it further. The mission loop is too samey – drive here, hack a few things, sneak/shoot out – and multiplayer is too throwaway to really affect much. You'll undoubtedly enjoy your time with it, but it won't linger long in the memory.",1401173119.0

Reviews
--------------------

**Attack of the Fanboy** - William Schwartz - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://aotf.com/reviews/call-of-duty-ww2-review/)

>The developers hammer home what made Call of Duty so great in previous years, while also adding a bunch of modern content and gameplay twists of their own.  As far as Call of Duty games go, WW2 is an instant classic.

--------------

**AusGamers** - Steve Farrelly - [9 / 10.0](http://www.ausgamers.com/reviews/read.php/3586281)

>Another great Holiday release to add to your (likely) growing pile.

**COGconnected** - Trevor Houston - [85 / 100](http://cogconnected.com/review/call-of-duty-wwii-review/)

>It remains as punishing as any other zombie game I have played to date.

--------------

**Critical Hit** - Miklós Szecsei - [8.5 / 10.0](http://www.criticalhit.net/review/call-of-duty-wwii/)

>Call of Duty: WWII is a great entry into the long-running series. Sledgehammer has done a fantastic job in creating a Call of Duty that will appeal to contemporary fans and those fans who might have favourable memories of earlier games in the series. It often walks a fine line between thoughtful representation of World War II and typical Call of Duty flamboyance, but it's a line that Sledgehammer walks with confidence. The result is a Call of Duty that feels assured of what it's trying to accomplish, and what it accomplishes is riveting, entertaining and at times hard-hitting.

--------------

**Digital Chumps** - Alex Tudor - [9.5 / 10.0](http://digitalchumps.com/call-duty-ww2-review/)

>Call of Duty: WW2 is the best Call of Duty in years. Bombastic story, killer grounded multiplayer, and a dark and scary Zombies make up one of the most complete and enjoyable Call of Duty experiences in years.

--------------

**EGM** - Nick Plessas - [8.5 / 10.0](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/call-of-duty-wwii-review/)

>Call of Duty: WWII's changes to the core Call of Duty experience are few but distinct. This leads to a good balance between relishing everything Call of Duty used to be and still continuing to move the series forward.

--------------

**Gadgets 360** - Rishi Alwani - [7 / 10](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/cod-ww2-review-call-of-duty-world-war-2-review-gameplay-1770030)

>All in all, Call of Duty: World War 2 plays like the series' early hits. By no means is this a bad thing, though the overall formula and package is wearing thin.

--------------

**Game Informer** - Daniel Tack - [8.8 / 10.0](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/call_of_duty_wwii/b/playstation4/archive/2017/11/02/rallying-the-shooter-on-multiple-fronts.aspx)

**GamesBeat** - Dean Takahashi - [94 / 100](https://venturebeat.com/2017/11/02/call-of-duty-wwii-review-redefining-what-it-means-to-be-a-hero/)

>My hat's off to the developers at Sledgehammer who are helping a new generation understand the sacrifices of those who died in the Second World War.

--------------

**GameSpot** - Miguel Concepcion - [9 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-wwii-review-in-progress/1900-6416800/)

>Sledgehammer Games superbly takes Activision's marquee shooter franchise back to its boots-on-the-ground roots.

--------------

**GamesRadar+** - Leon Hurley - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.gamesradar.com/call-of-duty-ww2-review/)

>COD has a few issues in single player this year but the overall package delivers another good shooter with plenty to do and some neat new online ideas.

**GamingTrend** - Mike Dunn - [90 / 100](http://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/the-eyes-of-the-world-are-upon-you-call-of-duty-wwii-review/)

>With a campaign that brings some of the most historical battles of the European Theater to life like never before, multiplayer that combines the best of the old and the new, and one of the most visceral Zombies games the series has had, Call of Duty WWII is a triumphant return to its roots, reminding us why those early games were so good in the first place.

**God is a Geek** - Calvin Robinson - [9 / 10.0](http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/call-of-duty-wwii-review/)

>A spectacular release that has a strong chance of becoming a fan favourite as one of the best Call of Duty releases in years.

**Hardcore Gamer** - Steve Hannley - [4.5 / 5.0](http://www.hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=277412)

>Call of Duty: WWII will be fascinating to study from a business standpoint: will consumers embrace the product they have long been clamoring for and how will Activision handle its business strategy moving forward? Will they dive exclusively back into World War II until gamers tire of it again or cycle between different eras from here on out? Whatever happens, there's a fantastic game at the center of this future case study that proves that no matter the ballyhoo, Activision will ensure a superb experience is delivered.

>Call of Duty WWII is a really neat package. The campaign, even if still too predictable, is powerful and enjoyable (while it lasts). Headquarters and War Mode gave a new coat of paint to the PvP and Nazi Zombies is a tough and deep experience.

**IGN Spain** - Juan García - *Spanish* - [8.3 / 10.0](http://es.ign.com/call-of-duty-wwii-ps4/125149/review/call-of-duty-wwii-analisis-para-ps4-xbox-one-y-pc)

>A return to the old good times of Call of Duty that brings more from that time than we were expecting. The campaign feels short and too linear, while the multiplayer options shine with a different light compared with previous CoD experiences. A good game, but not the best one on the series.

--------------

**Impulsegamer** - Sean Warhurst - [4.5 / 5.0](http://www.impulsegamer.com/call-duty-wwii-ps4-review/)

>Call of Duty: WWII is precisely what fans have been clamouring for over the last few years – A return to traditional boots-on-the-ground gameplay with an increased focus on skill and I have no doubt that it will resonate with fans in a way that the last few games have failed to manage.

**M3** - Niklas Alicki - *Swedish* - [7 / 10](https://m3.idg.se/2.1022/1.681358/call-of-duty-wwii)

>Call of Duty WWII is in the middle of an identity crisis, but by going back to its roots, it has created slower and more tactical gameplay that is much more fun to play than the wall running and double jumping from the last few installments.

--------------

**NZGamer** - Keith Milburn - [8.5 / 10.0](http://nzgamer.com/reviews/2669/call-of-duty-ww2.html)

**PlayStation LifeStyle** - Chandler Wood - [9 / 10.0](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2017/11/03/call-of-duty-wwii-review-brothers-arms-ps4/)

>World War II was the right move. Call of Duty reaches back to its roots to bring players an entry worthy of the series' namesake. The campaign is emotional, multiplayer is classic, and Nazi Zombies is downright dark and terrifying. No matter which kind of player you are, there is something for everyone, whether it's a cinematic story, a competitive and social multiplayer, or an immensely difficult battle against undead Nazis. Call of Duty: WWII is another incredible package of experiences, each distinct from the others, but tied together by the unifying themes of World War II that deserve your attention.

>The campaign attempts to bring up the ""tough"" questions about war, but when you're intermingling those questions with outrageous, comic violence, it comes off as disingenuous.

**Telegraph** - Chris Schilling - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/reviews/call-duty-ww2-review-explosive-surprising-return-roots/)

--------------

**Xbox Achievements** - Richard Walker - [80%](http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/call-of-duty-world-war-2/review/)

>CoD's return to World War II seems like its been a long time coming, but nine years on from World at War, Call of Duty: WWII proves that there are still stories to be told based on history's most deadly conflict. It's also proof positive that Call of Duty can still deliver an edge-of-the-seat FPS experience.

It’s the same general idea with new vault hunters, but with little of the joy and danger that I fell in love with in earlier entries.*|PC|
|[**XGN**](https://www.metacritic.com/publication/xgn?filter=games) \- [Ralph Beentjes](https://www.metacritic.com/publication/xgn?filter=games) \- *Dutch*|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.xgn.nl/review/borderlands-3-review)|*Borderlands 3 has surpassed the bar that its predecessor had set. The story is grand in scale, the humor is on-point and updated to 2019, weapons are diverse and the new Vault Hunters are unique in every way. Every BL-fan must pick this game up.*|PC|
|[**Hobby Consolas**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas) \- [Álvaro Alonso](https://opencritic.com/critic/3755/-lvaro-alonso) \- *Spanish*|94 \~ [94 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-borderlands-3-ps4-xbox-one-pc-488185)|*Gearbox has taken the Borderlands formula and improved it to achieve the definitive ""looter shooter"". Bigger, better, longer and funnier; Borderlands 3 is legendary loot.*|PC|
|[**Destructoid**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/90/destructoid) \- [Chris Carter](https://opencritic.com/critic/431/chris-carter)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-borderlands-3-564978.phtml)|*Borderlands 3 takes most of the good bits of Borderlands 2 and either rolls with them or improves upon them. It didn't need to reinvent the wheel either, as Gearbox pretty much had the formula figured out the second time around.*|PC|
|[**Forbes**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/290/forbes) \- [Paul Tassi](https://opencritic.com/critic/1156/paul-tassi)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2019/09/09/borderlands-3-review-pc-the-once-and-future-king/)|*Borderlands 3 was worth the wait and will be a fixture in this genre for years to come. And I think few fans of the last two will be disappointed when they get their hands on it at last.*|PC|
|[**Shacknews**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/62/shacknews) \- [Josh Hawkins](https://opencritic.com/critic/279/josh-hawkins)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/113826/borderlands-3-review-no-rest-for-the-wicked)|*The Borderlands formula might be a bit dated with its raunchy jokes and cheesy dialogue, but that doesn’t change that it is a formula that keeps reeling players back in again and again. Despite the fact that I’ve already logged over 40 hours in the game, I still can't help but feel the want to dive back in with a new character just to experience it all again.*|PC|
|[**IGN**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign) \- [James Duggan](https://opencritic.com/critic/5414/james-duggan)|90 \~ [9 / 10](http://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/09/borderlands-3-review)|*If Borderlands 3 is what happens when a modern looter shooter doesn’t concern itself with the longevity of its item economy and daily quests then you can sign me up for Borderlands 4 right now. Being untethered from persistent servers and able to trade loot at will is a refreshing change of pace, but that’s hardly the only reason why this such an amazing co-op FPS. The sheer magnitude and diversity of its arsenal of fun and surprising weaponry is unmatched, and the striking amount of loving detail and variety packed into its energetic and replayable 30-hour campaign is what makes Borderlands 3 a high-point for the series – and the genre as a whole.*|PC|
|[**Vandal**](https://www.metacritic.com/publication/vandal?filter=games) \- [Carlos Leiva](https://opencritic.com/critic/4601/carlos-leiva) \- *Spanish*|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://vandal.elespanol.com/analisis/ps4/borderlands-3/46579#p-13)|*Borderlands 3 is bigger and better. It’s everything we expected for the third main entry, and even if it’s very conservative, it’s a fantastic game you will love with friends or even on your own.*|PC|

##Gaming Trend - 10/10

[Review](http://gamingtrend.com/reviews/back-in-black-cod-black-ops-iii-review/)

Author: Justin Pauls 

>Call of Duty: Black Ops III deserves your time – take a day off work to play. With two campaigns, world-class online combat and a deep and passionate step forward with Zombies (not to mention the fantastic Dead Ops Arcade 2), there is something here for everyone.

##EGM - 9.5/10

[Review](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-iii-review/)

Author: Ray Carsillo

>It’s never easy to continually one-up yourself, but Treyarch seems just fine rising up to the challenge each time its turn comes up to put out a Call of Duty game. By adding progression and co-op to each mode, players have new reasons to go back and play each one more, while also providing a common thread through each part to help pull it all together. Multiplayer and Zombies are more robust than ever, and although Campaign’s story might not have been the strongest we’ve seen from series, it’s still a high-quality thrill a minute ride with a twist that will keep players talking until the series’ next installment. Simply put, Black Ops III is the deepest experience the franchise has seen thus far.

## Game Informer - 9/10

[Review](http://www.gameinformer.com/themes/blogs/generic/post.aspx?WeblogApp=playstation4&y=2015&m=11&d=05&WeblogPostName=call-of-duty-black-ops-iii-review-game-informer&GroupKeys=games/call_of_duty_black_ops_iii/)

Author: Daniel Tack 

>Despite a campaign that struggles with occasional mundane shootouts that bring the out-of-this-world story down to earth, the overall Call of Duty: Black Ops III package is incredibly strong, with something for everyone. Whether you’re into traditional multiplayer mayhem or zombie survival, you’ve got lots of choices that are fun solo and even better with friends.

## PlayStation LifeStyle - 9/10

[Review](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2015/11/05/call-duty-black-ops-3-review-bursting-seams-ps4/#/slide/1)

Author: Chandler Wood 

>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is an insanely full featured game. If code was a physical thing, this game disc would be bursting at the seams with how much Treyarch has packed onto one Blu-ray. There’s a little something for everyone here. Players looking for a dark, rich narrative have the campaign. Competitive players have a whole new way to play in multiplayer. Fans of roguelikes and horde modes have Shadows of Evil. Switching between all of these modes is extremely easy too, and it never felt like I was stuck playing one thing or another. Player freedom, customization, and choice are central to every element. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 isn’t just a great Black Ops game. It isn’t just a great Call of Duty game. It’s a damn good game overall. 

## Hardcore Gamer - 4.5/5

[Review](http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2015/11/05/review-call-of-duty-black-ops-iii/175738/)

Author: Steve Hannley 

>Call of Duty: Black Ops III was created in a three-year development cycle and it shows. This is basically five standalone games wrapped into one deep package. While it will have DLC released for it, there’s enough content out of the box to keep players busy until the next Call of Duty and probably some time after that. The campaign is perfectly paced and entertaining throughout, the multiplayer is rich with customization and Zombies is refreshingly challenging. The only real black mark is a story teetering on the on the brink of pretension, but the existentialism of it is undeniably fascinating. Jam-packed with meaningful content, Black Ops III is the Call of Duty you’ve been waiting for.

## Attack of the Fanboy - 9/10

[Review](http://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-review/)

Author: William Schwartz 

>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is absolutely stuffed to the brim with content on all fronts, and nearly none of it feels like filler.  Changes to single player and the addition of new cooperative modes make the campaign feel like less of an afterthought than it has in recent years, and gives players plenty of reasons to come back and play it again.  Treyarch stays at the head of the class with Black Ops 3 competitive multiplayer and zombies modes as well.  While three years has given us some time to possibly forget how masterfully crafted Black Ops 2 was, Black Ops 3 is both the biggest and best Call of Duty game we’ve seen since then.

## Destructoid - 8.5/10

[Review](http://www.destructoid.com/review-call-of-duty-black-ops-iii-318891.phtml)

Author: Chris Carter

>At this point, at least two of the Call of Duty developers (Treyarch and Sledgehammer), have it figured out. They now have a three-year development cycle, which means that technically, each individual game is not a rushed ""annual"" iteration. While the campaign could certainly be a lot stronger, Black Ops III is living proof of that concept.

Author: Amanda Dyar 

>The developers took bold risks with Black Ops IIIand many of those are what long time Call of Duty fans have been yearning for. Even if you have never played a Call of Duty game in your life, the new Zombies mode is something any Left 4 Dead or Evolve fan will appreciate.


## GamesRader - 4/5

[Review](http://www.gamesradar.com/call-duty-black-ops-3-review/)

Author: Maxwell McGee

>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is a massive, varied game, but your satisfaction will depend heavily on whether you have friends to play with either locally or online. Zombies finally comes into its own here with a play-style and design all its own, while the blockbuster campaign ends up feeling more Michael Bay than James Cameron. Multiplayer is the main attraction here, and the highly customizable loadouts and Specialist abilities combine to make it one of the most varied and enjoyable in the series. Just make sure you have someone you trust watching your back. 

## Polygon - 7/10

[Review](http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/6/9648812/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc)

Author: Arthur Gies

>At its heart, Black Ops 3's multiplayer is still very much Treyarch's take on Call of Duty. This means it's fun — Call of Duty and Black Ops found a basis for solid, competitive multiplayer that worked almost a decade ago, and it still resonates here and there. But I'm surprised by how familiar, how recognizable it all feels, which is even more disappointingly the case with its campaign. Black Ops 3's biggest point of recommendation may be the breadth of content there, and that's a valid point of view. But Treyarch doesn't meaningfully move the series forward here.

>In its undead modes, and the first 10 hours of multiplayer, it excels. But in its campaign, it merely crawls forward. Black Ops III doesn't offer anything remarkable to the series, but does just enough to maintain the Call of Duty status quo. The franchise, however slowly, continues its inexorable march.

## Giantbomb - 3/5

Author: Jeff Gerstmann

>Stuff. This game has a ton of stuff in it. The modes are there, they're many, and they're relatively diverse for a Call of Duty game. On paper, it might be the biggest Call of Duty package yet. But the devil's in the details here, and various changes made to multiplayer feel like more wheel-spinning from a series that's had a little too much wheel-spinning over the last few years. The movement options are nice, but I'd rather play this game with the movement controls found in last year's game. Perhaps some pockets of the still-large Call of Duty fanbase will enjoy different parts of it more than I did, but as I add it all up, Black Ops III is a pretty even mix of positive and negatives. It's OK.

>Because Black Ops 3 relies so heavily on its multiplayer servers, we're holding off on a final, scored review until we've had a chance to play in a live environment. The final score will be posted within 48 hours of launch. Our multiplayer impressions so far are based on our play time at a review event.",1446786203.0

>After the excellent Wasteland 2, we were excited to get our hands on the new installment, and we can say without fear that it has met expectations. Wasteland 3 is a sign of the love that InXile has for his work and Brian Fargo for the genre that has created a name for him. If you are a lover of the saga or the genre, do not hesitate to enjoy it.

>On Paper Wasteland 3 sounds like the perfect RPG-Dream but the execution leaves much to be desired. Bugs, Glitches and graphics that doesn't really represent a game that releases and the end of this console generation are a bit of a letdown. Everything else from the great story, entertaining NPCs, solid battle system, clever leveldesign over to the love for details is amazing, besides some flaws that should soon be fixed, as inXile and Brian Fargo promise. Everyone that wasn't happy with the latest Fallout Games will surely love Wasteland 3.

>Wasteland 3 is a old-school role-playing game, with a compelling story, a combat system that promises but is not groundbreaking and some funny moments and black mood, which always remind us that we are in a post apocalyptic world, but with a smile. Don't forget the powerful character editor, rhythm voices, and the beautiful scenery that puts you in that atmosphere of cold and snowy Colorado.

>Wasteland 3 can be a bit of slog if you're gunning for marathon gaming sessions with it at the helm. Combat, whilst exciting initially can fall into the traps of repetition. A little more variety could have negated some of the repeated player actions.  That said, the story is compelling and the characters an interesting assortment of misfit survivors, although perhaps fitting post-apocalyptic stereotypes.  It's a fun, easy to play game overall though that should well-please fans of the series and keep players entertained for quite some time with its high replay-value. However, aside from some bugs here and there, the impressive amount of voice-work on offer, the character building is the best part of the experience where you can really nurture your ranger squad in this snowy post-apocalyptic world.

>I will be even happier with Wasteland 3 once it’s patched and most of the bugs that bit me end up getting squashed. Even in its current state I’m having a grand ol’ time bringing some justice to the cold depths where no Ranger has dared to before. But for as much of a blast as I’m having out northeast in the cold, I hope I can make it back to sunny Arizona in time to save my fellow lawmen!

>Wasteland 3 is a throwback to the old School RPGs of yesteryear, while providing a new combat experience and a bigger world. Players that liked previous Fallout Games, or games like Wasteland 2 or Baldur's Gate will feel right at home with this title, and will have the opportunity to try X-Com like combat.

>There are a few misgivings related to Wasteland 3's technical aspects, mechanics, and overall challenge.

>It took me a while to realize how much these interactions, whether it be the interpersonal conversation or combat encounters themselves, stuck with me. Wasteland 3 has rules, but they only exist for you to bend them. With limitless character creation combinations, branching dialogue choices that affect what quests you do or don’t experience, and multiple endings, Wasteland 3 is an expanse of content and opportunity. The change in locale does wonders, no longer relying on a tired post-apocalyptic biome. Wasteland 3 has a wonderful backdrop in Colorado’s frozen wastes, making it the perfect place to spend a nuclear winter.

>Wasteland 3 doesn't change its predecessor's successful formula but, outside of certain design limitations, it perfects and modernizes it. It's easily the best game in the franchise, in terms of pure technique, and one that clearly gives you an idea of what inXile is able to achieve.

**[The Games Machine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/497/the-games-machine)** - [Danilo Dellafrana](https://opencritic.com/critic/3695/danilo-dellafrana) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/wasteland-3/wasteland-3-recensione/)

>Wasteland 3 is a good role-playing game, technically passable but enriched by a dense network of intriguing subplots that will push the most dedicated to play it several times. Watch out for the ever-present release bugs, though – best to wait a couple patches if you want to avoid unnecessary hurdles.

>All in all, this is the game I wanted so badly for Wasteland 2 to be. It doesn’t just repeat what came before, but expands upon it all. Not just mechanically, but story wise as well.

>Wasteland 3 features everything only the best role-playing games do: an engaging story powered by excellent writing, compelling characters, tons of customization options, and a deep tactical combat system that feels fresh even after dozens of hours. But, most of all, it features a living world that reacts to what the player does, and changes depending on how the player decides to deal with the troubles ahead, providing a role-playing experience of the highest degree, one that very few games can boast of.

**[Windows Central](https://opencritic.com/outlet/515/windows-central)** - [Jez Corden](https://opencritic.com/critic/4653/jez-corden) - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.windowscentral.com/wasteland-3-review)

>Wasteland 3 is a testament to the power of the branching narrative, taking it far beyond binary choices and into a grand canopy of cause and effect. It gives the wintry climbs of Colorado a lifelike quality that must have been painstaking to build. The most impressive RPG in years, Wasteland 3 is a masterpiece.

-------------

**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9.7 / 10](https://xboxera.com/2020/08/26/review-wasteland-3/)

>Wasteland 3 shines with clear dedication to crafting the best game its genre has ever seen. Excellent visuals are matched by top notch voice work and some of the best and most natural writing I have seen in a video game not made by Naughty Dog. The combat is a brutal dance where one wrong move can spell disaster, but victory is an exhilarating rush that never becomes old. Wasteland 3 cements inXile as one of the best in the business in the RPG genre and affirms that Xbox has something truly special on their hands.

Reviews

**Arcade Sushi** - Jason Fanelli - [8 / 10] (http://arcadesushi.com/yooka-laylee-review-xbox-one/) (XB1)

> For the most part the Yooka-Laylee has succeeded in meeting expectations, though a few specters from that bygone era decided to make the journey too.

--------------------

**Ars Technica** - Mark Walton - [Unscored] (https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/yooka-laylee-review/) (PS4)

> Yooka-Laylee stays true to its '90s platformer roots, even to its detriment. But there are just enough modern touches and excellent platforming to make it more than just another nostalgia play.

--------------------

**Attack of the Fanboy** - Dean James - [4 / 5 stars] (http://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/yooka-laylee-review/) (XB1)

> Serving as an homage to the past, Yooka-Laylee is strongly inspired by elements of the team’s previous efforts, and despite some flaws, it is the game that fans have been waiting for all these years.

--------------------

**Brash Games** - Liam Pritchard - [8 / 10] (http://www.brashgames.co.uk/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review/) (PS4)

> Its commitment to nostalgia is both Yooka-Laylee’s greatest strength and its greatest weakness. The characters are largely annoying and the writing and delivery is almost universally bad, but man, that gameplay is still very special indeed. Having been largely starved of traditional 3D platformers for the past 15 years, this serves as a perfectly timed reminder of why the genre was so popular in the first place. With its fantastic mechanics married to a selection of sprawling words chock full of challenges and a fantastically addictive sense of progression, Yooka-Laylee overcomes its occasional rough edges and lack of polish to deliver the finest 3D platformer this side of Super Mario Galaxy.

--------------------

**Brash Games** - Mat Cooper - [9 / 10] (http://www.brashgames.co.uk/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review-2/) (XB1)

> For a genre which ruled during the 90s thanks to the likes of Rare and Nintendo, bonafide 3D free-roaming platforming hasn’t been on the radar for over a decade. Yooka-Laylee brings it back in force: It’s better than Crash Bandicoot, better than Spyro the Dragon… In places, even better than its inspiration. Only let down by it’s lack of good humour, I’m pleased to say that Yooka-Laylee is everything I hoped it would be. It’s big, it’s beautiful, and it’s packed with quality content.

--------------------

**CGMagazine** - Elias Blondeau - [9 / 10] (http://www.cgmagonline.com/reviews/yooka-laylee-review-turning-page/)

> Yooka-Laylee is both a joyful ode to Rare’s heyday and a polished platformer that stands head and shoulders above what few contemporaries exist in the genre.

**COGconnected** - Rory Wood - [83 / 100] (http://cogconnected.com/review/yooka-laylee-review/) (XB1)

> Yooka-Laylee is a whimsical and witty gem of a 3D platformer, offering a wealth of secrets to find, puzzles to solve and large colorful worlds to explore each of which are populated with some of the most charming characters to hit a video game in years. The good far outweighs the negative and any shortcomings found never outshine the fun to be had. Yooka-Laylee made me feel like a kid again and proves there’s still a place for the classic 3D collectathon.

--------------------

**Crash Landed** - Dave Robinson - [4 / 5 stars] (http://crashlanded.co.uk/yooka-laylee-review.php)

> Originally billed to backers as a successor to the now classic Banjo-Kazooie series, Yooka-Laylee from developer Playtonic Games delivers on that promise in spades and more, becoming in essence Banjo-Kazooie 3 in all but name; with a grand collectathon adventure awaiting you, complete with quirky characters, a rousing score and a British charm that all now iconic Rare games exude.

> It’s a feat in itself that the developers have managed to craft a title the size of Yooka-Laylee with the small team at hand, but that limitation does rear its head with some wonky mechanics and puzzles that were best left on the cutting room floor.

> But the true success story of Yooka-Laylee, will be in managing to capture that once thought lost Rare essence, and the real question now is whether there is still a wider market out there today beyond those who grew up with the Nintendo 64 classics wishing to revisit nostalgia. One thing is for certain though, if you’re looking for a fun, colourful adventure to suck up 30 hours of your life then Yooka-Laylee is your man, or bat, or lizard - or, ah whatever.

--------------------

**Critical Hit** - Alessandro Barbosa - [6 / 10] (http://www.criticalhit.net/review/yooka-laylee/) (PS4)

> Yooka-Laylee is a nostalgic trip to the past that ignores all the innovations that came after it. There's an appeal to return to a bygone era of platforming, but it's quickly washed away with long stretches of tedious, boring gameplay, and a sense of wit that thinks it's far smarter than it really is.

--------------------

**Cubed3** - Drew Hurley - [8 / 10] (http://www.cubed3.com/review/3753/1/yooka-laylee-playstation-4.html) (PS4)

> Yooka-Laylee is the perfect collectathon game for veterans of the N64 and a true spiritual successor to the spectacular Banjo-Kazooie. It is exactly what people were hoping it would be, but there are a few critical flaws that are impossible to ignore. It feels like a title taken from the N64 and polished up to this generation, but games have changed a great deal since that era. Arguably, had this incorporated some of those changes, it could have been even better, but instead it has embraced its concept and stayed true to its roots. Regardless, the low price point, inviting gameplay and pure fun of the game means this is one that everyone should try.

--------------------

**Cubed3** - Greg Giddens - [9 / 10] (http://www.cubed3.com/review/3752/1/yooka-laylee-xbox-one.html) (XB1)

> A stiff challenge, no handholding, and large, open levels is somewhat daunting at first, but spectacular level and character design, sarcastic, fourth wall-breaking humour, and oodles of collectables will quickly grip and immerse you in Yooka and Laylee's quirky world. This is a 3D platforming fan's dream title.

--------------------

**Cubed3** - Tomas Barry - [9 / 10] (http://www.cubed3.com/review/3751/1/yooka-laylee-pc.html) (PC)

> Reflection upon Yooka-Laylee raises a genuine smile in a way that few video games ever do these days. Undoubtedly, this will sound like the stereotypical ramblings of a Banjo-Kazooie fan drunk on nostalgia; it's true that when Rare slipped into obscurity, setting to work on other types of projects, they left a massive void for this brand of quirky, humorous, collection-heavy platforming adventure. Playtonic has recognised and rectified this, reminding the gaming world that this sub-genre has fallen out of favour for far too long. While it leans on a unique contextual crux, considering the team's history and the Kickstarter origins of the project, the end result is something truly delightful in its own right. A brilliant successor that perfectly channels the creative energies of the N64 platforming era.

--------------------

**DarkZero** - Ian Howarth - [8 / 10] (http://darkzero.co.uk/game-reviews/yooka-laylee-pc/) (PC)

> I found it a ton of fun and terribly addicting to the point where I just consumed it in about 2 days and I hope many others enjoy it just as much because I believe the best outcome from its release is that Yooka-Laylee facilitates the second coming of the 'platformer'. Not only does it show off the familiar mechanics we love but it plays off of them in both the gameplay and story, making jokes about the established traits of old-school games by having Yooka's humoring of the NPCs and Laylee's dry sarcasm almost be the voices of the player as they comment on the fact that the Pagies could just slips out of their cages and so on.

--------------------

**Den of Geek** - Matthew Byrd - [3 / 5 stars] (http://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/yooka-laylee/263426/yooka-laylee-review) (PC)

> Yooka-Laylee’s faithfulness to old-school Rare games invokes an interesting dilemma. See, Yooka-Laylee is exactly the game that Playtonic told everyone it was going to be. They’ve lived up to nearly every promise they made on their Kickstarter page, and those who backed the game are going to get exactly the kind of experience that they funded.

> That same crowd is going to say that Playtonic never said that Yooka-Laylee was supposed to be anything more than a spiritual sequel to Banjo-Kazooie and that it’s not fair to judge it as anything but that. While Yooka-Laylee could be considered the finest Banjo-Kazooie game ever made- and certainly the best one not bearing the official name - you can’t help but feel that Playtonic missed a golden opportunity to retain the charming qualities of those titles while advancing the fundamental gameplay in a way that removes the repetitiveness that exists in-between objectives. 

> If Yooka-Laylee had replicated the thrilling action of Ratchet and Clank or the adventurous platforming of Super Mario Galaxy, then it could have possibly inspired a genuine rebirth of the genre by showing new fans and old fans how this style of game is able to contribute an all-around experience that few modern games can provide.

> As it stands...well, it’s hard to hate Yooka-Laylee, but that doesn’t mean you have to love it.

--------------------

**Digitally Downloaded** - Brad L. - [3 / 5 stars] (http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2017/04/review-yooka-laylee-sony-playstation-4.html) (PS4)

> It's crushing that Yooka-Laylee does not reach the heights of brilliance of the game it clearly draws its inspiration from. On its own, it is a decent game that is playable, but we were promised characters as delightful as in Banjo-Kazooie, and gameplay as slick and joyful to back those characters up.

--------------------

**Digital Trends** - Will Fulton - [3.5 / 5 stars] (http://www.digitaltrends.com/game-reviews/yooka-laylee-review/)

> 'Yooka-Laylee' recaptures the feeling of the beloved 'Banjo-Kazooie', but fails to add anything substantially new or interesting.

--------------------

**Destructoid** - Chris Carter - [8 / 10] (https://www.destructoid.com/review-yooka-laylee-425484.phtml) (XB1)

> Banjo Threeie is probably never going to happen, but after playing Yooka-Laylee I'm fine with that for the first time in 17 years. Playtonic's first foray is rough around the edges, but the center is so full of heart that it'll melt away the more you play it. How much of that roughness you can put up with entirely depends on your history and mental fortitude for mascot platformers. For some of you that threshold is pretty low, but for me, it's as high as Laylee can fly.

--------------------

**DualShockers** - Logan Moore - [7.5 / 10] (http://www.dualshockers.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review-fun-familiar-nostalgic-trip-genre-past/) (XB1)

> At the end of the day, Playtonic accomplished exactly what they set out to achieve with Yooka-Laylee and proved that 3D platformers can still be relevant in 2017. Yooka-Laylee is a fun, familiar, and nostalgic trip to a genre from the past that still holds up incredibly well in the present. It certainly proves that there is a place in the current landscape for games of this genre. If you miss the mascot platformer of yesteryear, then Yooka-Laylee will almost certainly give you your fill and make you feel warm inside.

--------------------

**Eurogamer** - Edwin Evans-Thirlwell - [Unscored] (http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-04-04-yooka-laylee) (XB1)

> Playtonic's tribute to Banjo is a gentle, irreverent platformer let down by spotty handling and a slight shortage of genius.

--------------------

**Fenix Bazaar** - Jayden Williams - [9 / 10] (https://fenixbazaar.com/2017/04/05/yooka-laylee-review-the-new-banjo-kazooie-game-youve-waited-20-years-for/)

> Yooka-Laylee is a fantastic game that delivers on its aspirations as Banjo-Kazooie’s spiritual successor. While it features a smaller scope than its inspiration, the game still manages to entertain and delight. There are issues concerning the camera and some control problems, but neither are worth writing home about. There’s also a fair bit of backtracking, but whether that’s an issue really comes down to personal perspective. At the end of the day, this is an old-school 3D platformer in almost every sense. It makes slight improvements on the established formula, but still largely retains everything fans remember about these sorts of games from 20 years ago. If that’s your jam, then Yooka-Laylee will have you playing with a smile.

--------------------

**Flickering Myth** - Scott Watson - [9 / 10] (https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2017/04/video-game-review-yooka-laylee/) (XB1)

> It’s testament to Playtonic Games pedigree, that throughout Yooka-Laylee the only grumbles I can muster are a few camera issues and a lack of voice acting. It’s a delightfully beautiful return to classic platform gaming and shows when done right that there’s still life in the old dog yet.

**Forbes** - Mitch Wallace - [8 / 10] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review-a-nostalgic-if-slightly-flawed-master-class-in-3d-platforming/#3a9cccc674a4) (XB1)

> I imagine there will be people who won't find this kind of flavor appealing, who might consider the game to be dated and maybe even outright pandering, but I'm not one of them.

--------------------

**Gadgets 360** - Rishi Alwani - [8 / 10] (http://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/yooka-laylee-review-1677281) (XB1)

> Playtonic's adherence to the playbook of its past successes works well in Yooka-Laylee. Some minor quirks notwithstanding, it's proof that game design that's almost two decades old still works as well as some of the more avant garde, open-world fare that we've seen of late. If you're hankering for a slice of colourful, high-definition infused retro goodness, look no further.

--------------------

**GameCrate** - David Jagneaux - [7.5 / 10] (https://www.gamecrate.com/reviews/review-yooka-laylee-picks-right-where-rare-left/15931) (PC)

> If you grew up playing 3D platformer collect-a-thon games like Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64, Jak & Daxter, Spyro, and others, then there is a good chance that you'll find a lot to love in Yooka-Laylee. It's a faithful recreation of the formula that made games of the late 90s and early 2000s both so special and so frustrating.

--------------------

**GameGrin** - Thomas Hughes - [8 / 10] (https://www.gamegrin.com/reviews/yooka-laylee-review/) (PC)

> At its best, Yooka-Laylee reminds me why I fell in love with colourful platformers, it's a love letter to childhood nostalgia. At its worst, Yooka-Laylee reminds me why we moved away from platforming games: odd design choices and occasional bugs sour the experience.

--------------------

**Game Informer** - Brian Shea - [8 / 10] (http://www.gameinformer.com/games/yooka-laylee/b/pc/archive/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-game-informer-review.aspx)

> Though camera problems and outdated level design are present at times, the moments of exhilaration, discovery, and satisfaction far outweigh those pitfalls. It feels like ages since I've played something like Yooka-Laylee. This is a game that was built for those who look back with fondness on the classics that spawned it, and in that regard, it delivers completely.

--------------------

**GamePro** - Tobias Veltin - [76 / 100] (http://www.gamepro.de/artikel/yooka-laylee-die-rueckkehr-eines-gefuehls,3312256.html) (PS4)

> Yooka-Laylee impressively transports the feeling of the Rare-Jump&Runs, but stumbles over its flawed controls and camera.

--------------------

**Game Revolution** - James Kozanitis - [4 / 5 stars] (http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/yookalaylee) (PC)

> By not holding up Banjo-Kazooie as the last bastion of platformers, Playtonic was able to turn Yooka-Laylee into an overall improvement on the formula it so closely mimics. We’re coming up on a relatively dry patch of 2017, and, if I’m counting on Yooka-Laylee to be my own personal flying lizard to carry me, I don’t think I could be in better hands.

--------------------

**GameSkinny** - Ashley Gill - [9 / 10 stars] (http://www.gameskinny.com/i7bxj/yooka-laylee-review-you-would-swear-collectathons-never-died) (PC)

--------------------

**GameSpew** - Richard Seagrave - [6 / 10] (http://www.gamespew.com/2017/04/yooka-laylee-review/) (XB1)

> Starting out relatively strong in the grand scheme of things, Yooka-Laylee unfortunately loses focus and charm as you progress, until you ask yourself why you’re putting yourself through it just to collect quills that become useless and Pagies that simply aren’t worth the frustration.

--------------------

**GameSpot** - Kallie Plagge - [6 / 10] (https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/yooka-laylee-review/1900-6416649/) (XB1)

--------------------

**GamingBolt** - Vijay Sinha - [8 / 10] (http://gamingbolt.com/yooka-laylee-review) (PS4)

> As a well-rounded platforming experience with smart writing, fun platforming, strong production values and evocation of the good ol’ days, Yooka-Laylee is worth your time.

--------------------

**Gamerheadquarters** - Jason Stettner - [9.3 / 10] (http://articles.gamerheadquarters.com/review576yookalaylee.html) (XB1)

> Yooka-Laylee is simply amazing, it's a blast to play and one of the best 3D platformers ever. The worlds are large in scale offering hours of gameplay that's enjoyable. You want to be out there grabbing collectibles, running through the worlds and meeting the characters. There were some minor issues that held it back from perfection, but still a stellar experience to behold. You can play with others in some mini games if you'd like though the real magic is the campaign. It never takes itself too seriously having fun with every moment and it's a game that all ages can enjoy.

--------------------

**Gamesradar** - David Houghton - [3 / 5] (http://www.gamesradar.com/yooka-laylee-review/) (PS4)

> Unfortunately, by not so much updating 20 year-old design concepts as porting them wholesale into the present - naiveties and technical issues complete - Yooka-Laylee recreates its origins far too accurately. The best of Banjo-Kazooie is here, but so is the worst, with a few new problems to boot. And while a lot of this was much less of an issue in ’98, in 2017 it just makes Yooka-Laylee a whole lot harder to like than you’ll want to.

--------------------

**God is a Geek** - Gary Bailey - [5 /10] (http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/yooka-laylee-review/) (XB1)

**Hardcore Gamer** - Jordan Helm - [3.5 / 5] (http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2017/04/04/review-yooka-laylee/252181/) (PS4)

**IBTimes UK** - Wesley Copeland - [2 / 5 stars] (http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/yooka-laylee-review-playtonics-rose-tinted-revival-quickly-becomes-overplayed-1614321) (PS4)

> It's difficult to recommend Yooka-Layee to adults let alone the children this game is aimed at. The unbalanced challenge it presents and the lack of in-game direction is sure to infuriate. You could argue kids of this generation could play the game alongside a YouTube video for help, but why should any game need to be played alongside a video guide? The first three-hours of Yooka-Layee are delightful, but after that the experience quickly sours. Playtonic's ode to platformers past should have been something special, but instead it's a reminder why video games have evolved, and why quality over quantity should be the first decree in every developer's rulebook.

--------------------

**IGN** - Marty Silva - [7 / 10] (http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review) (XB1)

> Yooka-Laylee contains all the pieces needed for a fun, enjoyable throwback to the 3D collectathons of the 64-bit era. The characters are charming and funny, your set of abilities is vast and entertaining, and four out of five of the worlds are fun playgrounds to explore. While it lacks the heart and polish of some of its incredible predecessors, it’s a good reminder that this genre, once thought to be dead, still has some life left in it.

--------------------

**IGN Italy** - Mattia Ravanelli - [7 / 10] (http://it.ign.com/project-ukulele-tba/123706/review/yooka-laylee-la-recensione) (PS4)

> Yooka-Laylee offers an interesting take on the classic 3D platfom formula. It's a pity that it controls and behave not as expected from some experienced developers as the Playtonic guys are.

--------------------

**IGN Spain** - Jose A. Rodriguez - [8 / 10] (http://es.ign.com/yooka-laylee-ps4/116833/review/yooka-laylee-analisis-multiplataforma) (PS4)

> Yooka-Laylee is the perfect tribute to the 90's 3D platforming videogames, a very fun experience for the new players and an exciting return of the genre to its roots for the older users. Long, fun and very joking, its camera becomes a harder enemy than Capital B, the game's main villain.

--------------------

**Impulsegamer** - Alayna Cole - [3 / 5 stars] (http://www.impulsegamer.com/yooka-laylee-ps4-review/) (PS4)

> Though a beautiful callback to a nostalgic genre, Yooka-Laylee is lacking in some areas that were difficult to forgive.

--------------------

**Keen Gamer** - Jordan Middler - [5 / 10] (https://www.keengamer.com/article/15918_yooka-laylee-review-ps4) (PS4)

> Yooka-Laylee reminds me why we left this era of games behind. While Playtonic has made an admirable attempt to provide long-term fans of their work with a Banjo-Kazooie for the modern era, the poor controls, tedious objectives and inconsistent writing have instead left us with a game that feels like a sad reunion tour rather than a return to form. For those who crowd-funded this game, I’m certain there will be elements that were exactly as you had hoped they would be, but as a game in 2017 Yooka-Laylee feels like a relic. Even the great music and bright, engaging art style aren't enough to stop Yooka-Laylee feeling like a disappointment.

--------------------

**Kotaku** - Heather Alexandra - [Unscored] (http://kotaku.com/yooka-laylee-the-kotaku-review-1793997849) (PC)

> Tearing away all of the bloat, Yooka-Laylee is a challenging and satisfying platformer. When it focuses on the basics, it succeeds with considerable flair. Yet, these moments arrive in short bursts that are padded out by confusing and hostile design. They point towards a far more enjoyable game than the complete package. The parts are significantly greater than the whole. There’s fun to be had but it doesn’t come easily. And if I never have to collect another shiny again, it’ll be far too soon.

--------------------

**Let's Play Video Games** - Laura Kate Dale - [35%] (http://letsplayvideogames.com/2017/04/review-yooka-laylee/) (PC)

> While the core collectathon is, in some ways, replicated well enough from Banjo Kazooie, the formula itself has aged pretty poorly. While I can still go back and enjoy a full playthough of Banjo Kazooie today from start to finish, a lot of that enjoyment is tied into nostalgia for the setting, cast and levels. Without that nostalgia, many parts of the formula now feel dated, twenty or so years on from their introduction.

> Sure it looks visually nicer, and the ability to play it with a dual analogue controller fixes some of the control issues Banjo had on N64, but that’s far from enough to redeem this game.

> I don’t know what else to say. Yooka Laylee, you’re just a poor facsimile of something I used to love. You really didn’t impress me.

**NZGamer** - Bronwyn James - [8 / 10] (http://nzgamer.com/reviews/2593/yooka-laylee.html) (PS4)

--------------------

**PC Gamer** - Tom Marks - [68 / 100] (http://www.pcgamer.com/yooka-laylee-review/) (PC)

**PlayStation LifeStyle** - Paulmichael Contreras - [8 / 10] (http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review-new-blasts-past/#/slide/1) (PS4)

> Yooka-Laylee is a breath of fresh air. Playtonic Games knows platforming, and knows it well. The incredibly precise reactions needed by players, coupled with the lack of some of the genre’s more modern conveniences may turn some newer/younger gamers off. But for those looking for a deceptively deep collect-a-thon that has an entertaining story and wonderfully-crafted world, look no further. With an asking price of $39.99, this is an easy recommendation for platforming fans.

--------------------

**PlayStation Universe** - Neil Bolt - [6 / 10] (http://www.psu.com/review/32665/yooka-laylee-review) (PS4)

> Yooka-Laylee shows there’s room for nostalgia-flavored 3D platforming in today’s market by reminding us of the joys of well-built, colorful worlds, and daft, fun characters. Unfortunately, the good work put in by Playtonic to modernise the stagnant genre is hamstrung by glaring technical issues that dull the vibrancy, and cloud over your enjoyment.

**Polygon** - Chelsea Stark - [5.5 / 10] (http://www.polygon.com/2017/4/4/15171316/yooka-laylee-review-xbox-one-pc-playstation-4)

> Yooka-Laylee looks the part of an updated platformer, but some of its mechanics should have stayed back in the era it came from. There was a reason we haven’t seen more games like Banjo Kazooie on modern platforms, and it wasn’t just because Rare as we knew it was gone; its ideas were very specific to a gameplay era that we’ve evolved past. Fourth-wall breaking dialog, shiny characters and lush graphics can’t save Yooka-Laylee from the dated framework that it’s built on.

--------------------

**Press Start** - Shannon Grixti - [6 / 10] (http://press-start.com.au/reviews/pc-reviews/2017/04/05/yooka-laylee-review-stuck-past/) (PS4)

> Nostalgia will hit hard within the first few hours, but once this fades, you'll realise that Yooka-Laylee is never able to live up to the brilliance that was Banjo-Kazooie. You'll get some enjoyment from the open-world platforming aspects of the game, but the unlikable characters, coupled with a clunky camera among  other redundant game mechanics will more than likely ruin the experience for you. I don't doubt that even the biggest of Banjo-Kazooie fans will be left wondering what could have been.

--------------------

**Pure Playstation** - Chris Harding - [9 / 10] (http://pureplaystation.com/?p=12595) (PS4)

> Yooka-Laylee is just what the industry needed: a firm, colourul, kick up the bum. There's lots to do, even more to see, and even more to collect. An expandable game that really does justice to the genre it's trying to revive. It's been a long time that a game has kept my attention with pure gameplay alone. It's a timeless classic that'll join the ranks of Spyro, Crash and Banjo, and deservedly so. Gimme more. Please.

--------------------

**Push Square** - Sammy Barker - [6 / 10] (http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/yooka-laylee) (PS4)

> It's colourful, there are collectibles, and it's got a rotten camera: Yooka-Laylee is a 90s platformer to a tee. Unfortunately, rather than a rose-tinted look at the titles of yore, this game falls into all of the same pitfalls as its predecessors: it's rough around the edges, often annoying, and at times even a chore. And yet for all of its flaws it's still packing the most important ingredient of all: the compulsion to collect everything is strong here – and it'll remain even when you're grinding your teeth.

**Rock, Paper, Shotgun** - Philippa Warr - [Unscored] (https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review/) (PC)

> I'm far less sure of how someone without that attachment to the originals will perceive the mix of flaws and strengths. For me the chance to revisit one of my first game infatuations did reduce the annoyances, or at least they became part and parcel of going back – you take the irritants with the joys because without it it wouldn't be the same.

**Slant Magazine** - Aaron Riccio - [4 / 5 stars] (http://www.slantmagazine.com/games/review/yooka-laylee) (PS4)

> This time around, Kickstarter actually did come to the rescue, delivering a game that is very much worthy of being called the spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie. Yooka-Laylee is a game for fans who miss the N64 days of running around a huge, open map, collecting a bunch of stuff and having a bit of a laugh. It's cute, it's funny, and a few minor technical issues aside, it's exactly what it promised to deliver.

> Yooka-Laylee is a game out of time, clinging so desperately to past glories it doesn’t seem to understand the Earth kept spinning after the N64 was discontinued. It’s everything wrong about the formative years of 3D platforming and it somehow retained none of what made the genre’s highlights endure...Yooka-Laylee is, in a word, rubbish.

--------------------

**TheSixthAxis** - Jim Hargreaves - [7 / 10] (http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review/) (PS4)

> Of all the potential hurdles to snag on in creating a 3D platformers in the style of the late nineties classics, Playtonic deftly avoids the most egregious ones by far. At its very core, Yooka-Laylee succeeds in reviving a format long forgotten and does so with such vigor and passion. However, players shouldn’t expect it to reinvent the genre.

--------------------

**The Stevivor** - Steve Wright - [9 / 10] (http://stevivor.com/reviews/yooka-laylee-review-a-near-perfect-kind-of-carbon-copy/) (XB1)

> Playtonic's special brand of humour is weaved throughout, seemingly innocent but with a sly wink towards those old enough to appreciate subtleties.

--------------------

**The Zero Review** - Liz Lisooey - [Love It] (https://www.thezeroreview.com/review/yooka-laylee/)

> My favorite thing about Yooka-Laylee is that it’s fun, which is not an easy thing to convey in a review. You can break down the level design, the mechanics, the graphics, etc. but how do you describe “fun”. I can tell you from the second I saw the opening screen a huge smile came across my face that would not leave. The first time I played it I couldn’t put it down. Then once my eyes would not stay open any longer it was all I could do not to scream from the rooftops how much I loved this game. All I wanted to do was call every 90s kid I knew and tell them they had to play Yooka-Laylee. I can try and break down why this is a quality game with thoughtful design, clean mechanics, heartwarming characters, but really you have to play this game to see what makes the game so special. Some things just can’t be put into words.

**ThisGenGaming** - Charlie Oakley - [9.5 / 10] (http://thisgengaming.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review-xbox-one-an-incredible-throwback-to-a-classic-generation-of-video-games/) (XB1)

> I'm struggling to find many faults with Yooka-Laylee. Okay, it's held back by some minor technical issues but other than those minor issues, this game was an absolute blast to play. If you're looking for a chilled out, over-the-top, and at time hilarious video game that is also fun to play then Yooka-Laylee deserves your attention. This gets an absolute recommendation from me, and a must buy at launch.

--------------------

**TrueAchievements** - Megan Walton - [4 / 5] (https://www.trueachievements.com/n27310/yookalaylee-review) (XB1)

> Yooka-Laylee is bright, colourful and fun from the outset, a theme that carries through the whole of the game. It's a colourful romp through a unique world filled with pagies, cagies and weirdly wonderful characters. It feels like a love letter to a time of games gone by in the best way possible, and it's hard not to be drawn to the way the game looks. A few issues with the camera and some of the controls stop the game being perfect, but it isn't far off.

--------------------

**TrustedReviews** - Brett Phipps - [2.5 / 5 stars] (http://www.trustedreviews.com/yooka-laylee-review)

> Yooka-Laylee is a nostalgic old-school adventure, but it’s too retro for its own good. Frustrating game mechanics, annoying boss fights and the complete lack of guidance become infuriating as the game progresses.

--------------------

**Twinfinite** - Chris Jecks - [4 / 5] (http://twinfinite.net/2017/04/yooka-laylee-review/) (PC)

> Yooka-Laylee is basically the Banjo-Kazooie game players have been waiting well over a decade for. No matter your age, Yooka-Laylee has something for everyone, be it the colorful characters and worlds that youngsters are sure to love, or the crude humor sprinkled throughout to appeal to the older audiences.

--------------------

**USgamer** - Nadia Oxford - [3 / 5 stars] (http://www.usgamer.net/articles/yooka-laylee-review) (XB1)

> Yooka-Laylee is built out of the heart, soul, guts, and bones of Banjo-Kazooie. It's exactly what fans of Rare's classic 3D wanted. Unfortunately, technical issues stick to it like bat guano.

--------------------

**VideoGamer** - Colm Ahern - [4 / 10] (https://www.videogamer.com/reviews/yooka-laylee-review)

> Yooka-Laylee would fit right into the late 90s with its vague puzzles, wakka-wakka voices, and confusing levels. Time has moved on since the N64, and while there are a handful of bright spots, this sadly isn't the catalyst for a 3D platformer revival.

--------------------

**Video Games Uncovered** - Liam Gittins - [9 / 10] (https://videogamesuncovered.com/reviews/yooka-laylee-review/) (PS4)

> Yooka-Laylee is everything fans were hoping for and more, it is pure childhood fun that we seemed to have left behind in the 90’s but reformed for the modern era. Fans of nostalgia and newcomers will both take to this title and enjoy it for what it is, a bit of harmless fun.

--------------------

**Wccftech** - Rosh Kelly - [8.5 / 10] (http://wccftech.com/review/yookalaylee-1998/) (PC, PS4)

> It might not be as good as your vague memories of the hallowed games of Rare, but Yooka-Laylee has a little bit of that old lovable magic in it. It may be made for children, but there is a little something that can make the old and miserable smile again. That alone is worth it.

--------------------

**We Got This Covered** - Jowi Meli - [3 / 5 stars] (http://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/yooka-laylee-review/) (XB1)

> At its best, Yooka-Laylee is a fun retread of '90s-era 3D platforming. Unfortunately, it fails to move the genre forward in any significant way, and even brings back several pains that should have stayed firmly planted in the past.

--------------------

**Xbox Achievements** - Dom Peppiatt - [55%] (http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/yooka-laylee/review/) (XB1)

> Yooka-Laylee is not a bad game, but by God does it have its problems. If you're hankering for a 3D platformer in the vain of Banjo-Kazooie, Spyro, Mario or Crash, I'd still say this is worth a bit of your time if you're willing to chew on the game in short sections. But if you want to marathon the game, or don't mind waiting until later in the year to have your genre itch scratched, you're probably better off passing on this.

--------------------

**ZTGD** - Ken McKown - [7 / 10] (http://www.ztgd.com/yooka-laylee/review/) (XB1)

> Yooka-Laylee is exactly what Playtonic promised, and also exactly what I expected. While some of the levels are not great, the overall package takes me back to a different time where the genre thrived. For better or worse this game recaptures what made those games special, and frankly if it starred a certain bear and bird combo, it could have easily been a sequel to a game from that era.

|[**ACG**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg) \- [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter)|Buy \~ [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ZUq8nSDBE)|*At a retail purchase, this is worth getting despite my misgivings with the story and the open-world areas because some people are just gonna experience it differently and I can recognize something as good that I just don't necessarily love. There's a lot to like here, it's a very polished title. And those multiplayer and singleplayer changes are actually very cool and that includes that multiplayer. I really did like the arcade modes I've got to play, and I absolutely loved Escape, that is going to be a very fun mode. And in the end, it is an incredibly polished title.*|PC|
|[**Player2.net.au**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/520/player2-net-au) \- [Matt Hewson](https://opencritic.com/critic/3904/matt-hewson)|A+ \~ [A+](https://www.player2.net.au/2019/09/gears-5-single-player-fighting-in-uncharted-territory/)|*Gears 5 offers, in my mind at least, the best game in the franchise yet and that is thanks to the developers feeling comfortable enough to take the game out of its usual wheelhouse. The introduction of the open maps, along with a fantastic story that is sure to make long-time fans jump with glee takes the Gears we know and love and brings it to the next level.*||
|[**Polygon**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/87/polygon) \- [Dave Tach](https://opencritic.com/critic/1501/dave-tach)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/4/20848517/gears-5-impressions-gears-of-war-review)|*Gears 5 is personal, like its predecessor, and insistent in focusing on its characters. It’s thoughtful, and unafraid to stop the action in favor of slower story beats and sections focused on exploration. And those are the parts that I enjoyed the most.*|XB1|
|[**Rock, Paper, Shotgun**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/270/rock-paper-shotgun) \- [Matthew Castle](https://opencritic.com/critic/1096/matthew-castle)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/09/04/gears-5-pc-review/)|*Gears 5 left my belly nice and fat, and keen for the next course.*|PC|

It's a very accessible product. It's a very consumer friendly product. And if Xbox brings this sort of quality and focus on a more regular basis in the next-gen, then we're gonna have an honest-to-goodness fight on our hands once more, which is exactly what it should be.*|XB1, PC|
|[**Worth Playing**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing) \- [Adam Pavlacka](https://opencritic.com/critic/290/adam-pavlacka)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](http://worthplaying.com/article/2019/9/4/reviews/116007/)|*Although it has a few stumbles, and an obvious setup for Gears 6, the overall campaign package is a satisfying experience whether you’re a long time Gears fan or entirely new to the series.*|XB1|
|[**Destructoid**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/90/destructoid) \- [Brett Makedonski](https://opencritic.com/critic/438/brett-makedonski)|Review-In-Progress \~ [Review-In-Progress](https://www.destructoid.com/review-in-progress-gears-5-565673.phtml)|*Thus far, Gears 5 is shaping up to be a solid Gears game, even if I'm not keen on the new things it's trying.*|XB1|
|[**Star News**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/386/star-news) \- [Rod Oracheski](https://opencritic.com/critic/2397/rod-oracheski)|100 \~ [5 / 5](http://starnews.ca/article/8842/review-gears-5/)|*Gears 5 is the best looking the series has ever been, and that’s maybe the least of the improvements here. A stellar package for the Gears hardcore and casual fans alike, and a great place to jump into the series thanks to the onboarding summaries.*|XB1, PC|
|[**God is a Geek**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/111/god-is-a-geek) \- [Adam Cook](https://opencritic.com/critic/569/adam-cook)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/gears-5-review/)|*If you didn't think you needed another Gears of War, you were wrong. Gears 5 is a barnstorming success, and a triumphant return for the series. This is the essential first party game the Xbox One desperately needed.*|XB1|
|[**Generación Xbox**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/431/generaci-n-xbox) \- [Pedro del Pozo](https://opencritic.com/critic/3050/pedro-del-pozo) \- *Spanish*|99 \~ [9.9 / 10](https://generacionxbox.com/analisis-de-gears-5/)|*Gears 5 is perfect as a new Gears and one of the best action titles of this generation. You can't ask for more quality content in one game.*|XB1|
|[**Heavy**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/627/heavy) \- [Elton Jones](https://opencritic.com/critic/5174/elton-jones)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://heavy.com/games/2019/09/gears-5-review/)|*The Coalition has simply knocked it out of the park with Gears 5.*|XB1|
|[**Hobby Consolas**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas) \- [Alejandro Alcolea Huertos](https://opencritic.com/critic/6451/alejandro-alcolea-huertos) \- *Spanish*|95 \~ [95 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-gears-5-xbox-one-pc-485045)|*Gears 5 takes a step forward in all aspects, with a campaign with open levels, but still very intense. Audiovisually it's a delight and the multiplayer expands with new more approachable modes and a renewed horde mode with hero shooter features. The best Microsoft Studios game in recent years.*|XB1|
|[**Glitched Africa**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/687/glitched-africa) \- [Marco Cocomello](https://opencritic.com/critic/2466/marco-cocomello)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://glitched.africa/gears-5-review-this-changes-everything/)|*The magic of Gears 5 is how all this comes together to offer the best entry in the series to date. Right from its exceptional campaign mode all the way to its new simple but effective Escape mode. The Seasonal Ranking ties everything you do across the game together to always deliver new challenges and rewards for completing them. It is simply one of the best games Microsoft has ever released.*|XB1, PC|
|[**ZTGD**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/97/ztgd) \- [Ken McKown](https://opencritic.com/critic/1136/ken-mckown)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](http://www.ztgd.com/reviews/gears-5-xb1/)|*Gears 5 rekindles the magic the first three games delivered in their prime and it has me excited to see where the series goes in the next generation. This is one of the best games Microsoft has put out this year, and quite possible one of the best games of 2019.*|XB1|
|[**Gamerheadquarters**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/337/gamerheadquarters) \- [Jason Stettner](https://opencritic.com/critic/2141/jason-stettner)|92 \~ [9.2 / 10](https://gamerheadquarters.com/articles/gears-5-review.html)|*Gears 5 is an ambitious, and incredible expansion of the franchise that takes this series to new heights.*|XB1|

Perhaps some of them wished for a more decisive revolution, but the developers' hard work can be seen and felt, and it can satisfy any kind of player.*|XB1, PC|

It's a package that's brimming with content, and has top-notch stuff on offer for you no matter what you're looking for. With its campaign, it successfully revitalizes a franchise may had feared was becoming stale, while with its online component, it continues to be on the top of its game, the way the series always been since the day it was born.*|XB1|
|[**Xbox Achievements**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements) \- [Richard Walker](https://opencritic.com/critic/679/richard-walker)|90 \~ [90 / 100](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/gears-of-war-5/review/)|*Once again, The Coalition proves itself as Gears of War's ideal custodian. Gears 5 is one of the best entries in the series yet, delivering an unrivalled package that still boasts the best headshots in the business.*|XB1|

The story isn't without its issues, especially the final act which I'm sure will draw controversy, but that does little to hold back this awesome next chapter in the Gears saga.*|XB1|
|[**GamesBeat**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/78/gamesbeat) \- [Dean Takahashi](https://opencritic.com/critic/1046/dean-takahashi)|90 \~ [90 / 100](https://venturebeat.com/2019/09/04/gears-of-war-5-review/)|*Gears 5 has a lot to offer, with multiplayer, co-op modes, and a single-player campaign with wide range of emotions, from humor and laughter to despair and tragedy. It leaves the fans with a bit of a cliffhanger ending, but that just means that fans will want Gears 6 to come soon.*|XB1, PC|
|[**Shacknews**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/62/shacknews) \- [Chris Jarrard](https://opencritic.com/critic/4311/chris-jarrard)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/113738/gears-5-review-stunning-gunning)|*If you never liked Gears of War before, this is not going to be the game to change your mind, as it sticks with the same formula, but does finally evolve the design in a positive way. If you were previously a Gears Stan, then this game is a must-buy.*|PC|

Bigger, better and more beautiful – and a bold step in the right direction for the series. The action is superlative, the writing hits humorous and emotional notes, and the number of multiplayer modes is extensive. If ever there was a reason to subscribe to Xbox's Game Pass service, this is it.*|XB1, PC|
|[**Gamers Heroes**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes) \- [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith)|90 \~ [9 / 10](http://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/gears-5-review-absolutely-badass/)|*Much like its iconic Lancer Assault Rifle, Gears 5 functions as perfectly as it was designed. The developers threw on a chainsaw of character, narrative, and content to make an over-the-top, thrilling experience from start to finish. Gears 5 is a badass game, and you'll come away feeling more badass than the legendary Marcus himself.*|PC|

Fans will love the story and lore and will equally enjoy the combat. It doesn’t reinvent the COG but then again, it doesn’t have to.*|XB1, PC|

This is the most heartfelt Delta Squad has ever been, and The Coalition backs up that emotion with genuine improvements to gameplay. While its new co-op mode, Escape, is generally underwhelming, Arcade mixes up the competitive meta enough to keep things interesting. All told, Gears 5 is more Gears, but it's also a bold statement for why this series is still relevant.*|XB1|

Sadly a lot of technical issues, bad level design and a lot of well meant ideas of the developers that didn't really delivered the effect they wanted doesn't make Gears 5 stand that much out compared to Gears of War 4.*||

You can start to see the developer thinking about new ideas and potential directions that the series can go, but Gears 5 feels largely familiar.  The additions of some new features and a new mode added to the fan-favorites that return make for a robust package though.*|XB1|

The Coalition's mark has finally been made, and it's one that focuses on narrative importance alongside bright, energetic mechanics that show that Gears 5 can happily stand alongside this generation's other blockbusters without fear.*||

|[**Eurogamer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer) \- [Edwin Evans-Thirlwell](https://opencritic.com/critic/132/edwin-evans-thirlwell)|Recommended \~ [Recommended](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-02-13-metro-exodus-review)|*Far from just another map-clearing game, Metro's first above-ground outing is an atmospheric, characterful voyage across a ruined Russia.*|PS4|
|[**AngryCentaurGaming**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/angrycentaurgaming) \- [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter)|Buy \~ [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnhGHsrlFS0)|*This is a 'Buy'. It is well worth the money. Now I understand some of you may not like it because it came out on the Epic Store first, and I absolutely get that, but just talking about the game itself for a second (maybe you're gonna wait a year to get it), it is still phenomenal. It is incredibly fun to play, the difficulty is well-balanced, and despite it having a couple issues here and there, and despite it being held within some narrative brackets, it was overall one hell of a ride.*|XB1|
|[**VG247**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/549/vg247) \- [Alex Donaldson](https://opencritic.com/critic/1621/alex-donaldson)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.vg247.com/2019/02/13/metro-exodus-review/)|*By taking its grim post-apocalyptic world above ground into wide, open areas, Metro Exodus adds a smart and engaging twist while retaining the series’ identity.*|PC|
|[**BBC The Social Gaming**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO43cLbljSpkBY4tiDBpwnw) \- Jordan Middler|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoe3fljzdiE)|*Metro Exodus feels like the first game in a franchise, not the third. It has elements that I could see becoming great with iteration, like the weapon customization or the more expansive levels, but it's not. It's the third in a franchise that has failed to live up to its potential for the third game in a row. You might get some of your Fallout kicks from this, but if story is the kind of thing you come to games for, then go to your nearest train station, board a train, and get as far away from Metro Exodus as you can.*|PS4|
|[**PowerUp!**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/577/powerup-) \- [Leo Stevenson](https://opencritic.com/critic/3173/leo-stevenson)|Unscored \~ [Review-In-Progress](https://powerup-gaming.com/2019/02/14/metro-exodus-review-in-progress-%d0%be%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%b5%d0%b7%d0%b8-%d0%bc%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%8f-%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%be%d0%b9-%d0%bf%d0%be-%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%be%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%87%d0%bd%d1%8b/)|*Metro Exodus drops you into an unforgiving, post-apocalyptic playground and gives you just enough tools to, maybe, make it out alive.*|PS4|
|[**TechAdvisor**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/628/tech-advisor) \- [Lewis Painter](https://opencritic.com/critic/5180/lewis-painter)|100 \~ [5 /  5 stars](https://www.gamebyte.com/gamebyte-reviews-metro-exodus/)|*Metro Exodus is a work of art; from the concept to design and gameplay, it ticks all boxes. It has an emotional campaign, various open-world environments full of unique flora, fauna and places of interest to explore, fantastic audio design and satisfying gunplay. What more could you want from a tight narrative-driven first-person shooter?*|PC|
|[**AusGamers**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/30/ausgamers) \- [Kosta Andreadis](https://opencritic.com/critic/1379/kosta-andreadis)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://www.ausgamers.com/games/metro-exodus/review/)|*Metro Exodus is without a doubt a fantastic single-player story-driven shooter. An experience that lives up to its ambition and promise, offering challenge and surprise in equal measure.*|PC|
|[**TechRaptor**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor) \- [Robert N. Adams](https://opencritic.com/critic/2003/robert-n-adams)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/content/metro-exodus-review)|*Metro Exodus builds on the gameplay of the previous titles and expands it into a much broader world, adding new mechanics and expanding the narrative without padding things too much.*|PC|
|[**3DNews**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/531/3dnews) \- [Денис Щенников](https://opencritic.com/critic/4050/-) \- *Russian*|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://3dnews.ru/982707)|*Metro Exodus is an unforgettable adventure. It works perfectly both as a semi-open world shooter and as an emotional story.*|XB1|
|[**GameCrate**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/155/gamecrate) \- [David Jagneaux](https://opencritic.com/critic/390/david-jagneaux)|93 \~ [9.25 / 10](https://www.gamecrate.com/reviews/review-metro-exodus-masterclass-tense-fps-pacing-and-action/22205)|*Metro Exodus is a masterful execution of a dying breed of video game: the measured, finely tuned, linear single player action game. From start to finish it’s an amazing thrill ride that rarely takes a moment to catch its breath and it lacks the bloated filler that plague so many other games these days. Instead, Metro Exodus is all meat from head to toe and it’s well worth the time.*|PC|
|[**The Games Machine**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/497/the-games-machine) \- [Mario Baccigalupi](https://opencritic.com/critic/3693/mario-baccigalupi) \- *Italian*|92 \~ [9.2 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/metro-exodus/metro-exodus-recensione-pc-ps4-xbox-one/)|*Metro Exodus should be preserved as a species near to extinction: it is not always perfect, but overall we are facing the best story driven FPS in recent years, crafted with love, much more freedom but still impressive in its narrative, graphical and playable level of details.*|XB1|
|[**PSX Brasil**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/514/psx-brasil) \- [Bruno Henrique Vinhadel](https://opencritic.com/critic/3869/bruno-henrique-vinhadel) \- *Portuguese*|92 \~ [92 / 100](https://psxbrasil.com.br/analises/analise-metro-exodus/)|*Saying that Metro Exodus is the best game in the Metro series is no exaggeration. The vast improvements are remarkable and deliver a fantastic game, even now when shooting games are only recognized by the online factor. Enhanced narrative, charismatic characters, excellent gameplay and flawless visuals make Metro Exodus one of the best shooting games of the generation. Exodus brings a pleasant nostalgia and is mandatory for fans of the franchise as well as worshipers of the genre.*|PS4|
|[**The Outerhaven Productions**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/335/the-outerhaven-productions) \- [Keith Mitchell](https://opencritic.com/critic/2139/keith-mitchell)|90 \~ [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.theouterhaven.net/2019/02/review-metro-exodus-theres-only-metro-nothing-else)|*Being perfectly honest, after the last two Metro games, not only is this one refreshing change, one that was needed. The open world, the crafting, and the large assortment of NPCs that you'll encounter during the game. The Metro's closed walls and need for something more gave way to all of this. Sure, we're finally on the outside, yet the hellish world that you've come to know doesn't take a backseat. Instead, we're just introduced to more of it. There's a whole new world to explore and experience, all while this new setting does the game good. Now we just need to know which ending is canon this time around. If this is the future of the series, I can't wait to see what 4A Games does next.*|PC|
|[**TrueAchievements**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/316/trueachievements) \- [Kevin Tavore](https://opencritic.com/critic/2248/kevin-tavore)|90 \~ [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.trueachievements.com/n36435/metro-exodus-review)|*Exodus is an overall excellent experience that succeeds at nearly everything it attempts to achieve.*|XB1|
|[**Wccftech**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/304/wccftech) \- [Chris Wray](https://opencritic.com/critic/1264/chris-wray)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://wccftech.com/review/metro-exodus-review/)|*All in all, Metro Exodus is a fantastic game that you'd be worse off for missing out.*|PC|
|[**Hobby Consolas**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas) \- [David Martinez](https://opencritic.com/critic/2884/david-martinez) \- *Spanish*|90 \~ [90 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-metro-exodus-ps4-xbox-one-pc-371187)|*Metro Exodus is an excellent story based shooter, which combines survival skills, exploration, stealth and combat. We love the post apocalyptic setting, based on the Metro novels by Dmitry Glukhovsky, and some open worlds elements.*|PS4|
|[**Gadgets 360**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/309/gadgets-360) \- [Rishi Alwani](https://opencritic.com/critic/1352/rishi-alwani)|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/metro-exodus-review-xbox-one-x-1993143)|*Metro Exodus is a gorgeous post-apocalyptic spectacle set in a dangerous yet intriguing world. Barring its technical omissions on console, there's no reason to miss out on one of the more entertaining shooters in recent memory.*|XB1|
|[**GamesRadar+**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-) \- [Austin Wood](https://opencritic.com/critic/1121/austin-wood)|90 \~ [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.gamesradar.com/metro-exodus-review/)|*A first-person survival shooter that's as engrossing as it is unnerving, Metro Exodus tells a powerfully human story in a world that's equal parts style and substance.*|PC|
|[**SECTOR.sk**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk) \- [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) \- *Slovak*|90 \~ [9 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/32124/metro-exodus.htm)|*New Metro game shows more from the post-apocalyptic world with some sandbox survival experience and thrilling story.*|PC|

Only the silence of the main character is a major problem. The game have a breathtaking artistic direction and visual quality. The staging is exceptional, it allows to put in abyss deep characters. It is hard to imagine a better adaptation for the novel of Glukhoovsky.*|PC|

If you can live with small technical hiccups you'll get a gripping adventure with lots of playful freedom and probably already one of the best shooter games of the year.*|PS4|

I wish they had touched more on some of the earlier threads of the series, but this is still one of the most engrossing games I have ever played.*|XB1|
|[**GameSkinny**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/421/gameskinny)|90 \~ [9 / 10 stars](http://www.gameskinny.com/0vbid/metro-exodus-review-the-great-survival-continues)|*Metro Exodus, 4A's new first-person shooter, is almost a perfect game, introducing exciting new elements while still offering the classic Metro experience.*|PC|

With polished visuals and an amazing soundtrack, the changes 4A Games have implemented create awesome environments and enjoyable gameplay, taking you across various landscapes of Europe. However, in doing so, the survival horror and dark, claustrophobic tone have almost entirely been left behind at the station.*|PS4|

It’s a frequently exhilarating and densely atmospheric journey across a Russian dystopia brimming with detail and deadly inhabitants, and well worth the trip for its consistently effective use of survival horror and hair-raising action.*|PS4, XB1, PC|

Each sequel builds on the foundation that its predecessors built yet can't quite shake some of the flaws that have always held them back a bit. Many of the issues found in 2033 and Last Light have been addressed. However, Metro Exodus still finds a way, especially as the game hits the third act, to remind us of many of the problems we've always had with this franchise.*|PC|

Although the change from indoor to outdoor scenery is striking at first, it allows the gameplay to breathe and feel different from previous titles. The signature makeshift guns are paired well with the new crafting ability, and their lack of stopping power makes firefights meaningful and stealth sections tense. There are still issues here and there, and the presentation could be tighter, but this is a worthy sequel to a game that has earned its cult status throughout the years.*|PC|

Metro Exodus can be unforgiving at times but it’s a rollicking, radioactive road-trip that’s sure to scratch that post-apocalyptic itch.*|XB1|

Unfortunately, there are a lot of things that keep the game from hitting the standard set by its predecessors. Pacing is hamstrung by the ambitious misfire of an 'open-world', while performance issues and glitches mar much of Exodus.*|PS4|

It offers a rich, evolving world, brought to life with stunning visuals, immersive sound and ghastly creatures. These thrills and chills are irritatingly tempered with menial tasks, poor voice acting, dull stealth and a soulless hero, all of which prevent Metro Exodus from achieving its true potential. Behind these grievances, however, lies a thrilling adventure for anyone who dares board The Aurora. Just prepare to get your ticket punched.*|PS4|

Combine that with a plot that doesn't answer its most intriguing questions and you've got an experience that will please at times, but will also disappoint those looking for something meaningful outside of the distribution of bullets.*|PS4|

This series has built a reputation on its quality, but Exodus falls flat in some ways that truly matter.*|XB1|

>For those who are eager for a new turn-based tactics game that succeeds at trying something new, or for those who have been keeping an eye on this game like I have over the past few years, Wargroove is immensely satisfying and certainly doesn’t seem to be going anywhere any time soon.

>There's a lot to love with Wargroove. I definitely have my qualms with some of the campaign mission design and plot, there is so much here to love. I can't say that it's a completely innovate entry into the genre, but I think it's safe to say that Wargroove is a title that needs to be in every turn-based strategy lover's catalog.

>Wargroove might be the least original game I've played in a long time, but it offers fans of the Advance Wars series something we've been lacking for a while. Thankfully, Wargroove does add enough subtle variations on Advance Wars' formula to create its own niche, and multiplayer is much easier than convincing your other friend with a Game Boy Advance to buy their own copy. Even if you're playing alone, there's plenty to see and do, as long as you're willing to learn some hard lessons along the way.

>Wargroove is the best turn-based strategy RPG that's come out in ages.

>It took a decade for the vacuum left by the absence of Advance Wars to be filled, not by a new game in the series but by Wargroove, an independent title that has all its qualities. The difference is the tone and look, the fantasy world rather than the military too, but for the rest, Wargroove is the turn-based tactical game that fans of the genre were waiting for, especially on Nintendo Switch obviously.

>As far as strategy games are concerned on the Switch, Wargroove is one of the best titles you can find on the eShop.

>Wargroove is the turn-based tactics game you've been waiting for. It looks wonderful and sounds amazing, but it also plays so well. The strategy layer is deep but simple to learn. With several different modes in single player and multiplayer, there is something for both hardcore and newcomers of the genre.

**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Dominic Leighton](https://opencritic.com/critic/307/dominic-leighton) - [9 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/30/wargroove-review/)

>In a world bereft of a new Advance Wars, Wargroove is a worthy successor. Its fantasy retro strategy stylings mark it out as a wonderful amalgamation of the classic Fire Emblem and Wars games, and while it doesn't revolutionise the genre in the way that the modern Fire Emblem games have it nails the feel of Intelligent System's best games – while standing proudly on its own.

>The wait has been worth it; Wargroove is absolutely a must-play title for fans of the genre and just Switch owners in general.

**[USgamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/66/usgamer)** - [Kat Bailey](https://opencritic.com/critic/303/kat-bailey) - [4 / 5 stars](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/wargroove-review)

>Wargroove takes a classic formula and repurposes it for a more traditional swords-and-sorcery fantasy setting (with battlepups). With its large number of modes and impressive suite of creation tools, it's almost enough to fill the Advance Wars-sized hole in our heart.

-------------

**[Wccftech](https://opencritic.com/outlet/304/wccftech)** - [Francesco De Meo](https://opencritic.com/critic/1717/francesco-de-meo) - [8.5 / 10](https://wccftech.com/review/wargroove-advance-medieval-wars/)

>Wargroove is the game fans of tactical role-playing games have been waiting for. The huge amount of content and play modes, solid gameplay almost completely devoid of RNG and excellent presentation make it a game that no fan of the genre should pass on.

Reviews
--------------------

**Areajugones** - David Cruz García - *Spanish* - [9 / 10](https://areajugones.sport.es/for-honor/analisis/) (PS4)

>For Honor is one of the best multiplayer experiences of the recent years, offering a well-balanced combat system and stunning graphics that reflect the potential of the current generation.

--------------

**Attack of the Fanboy** - Kyle Hanson - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/for-honor-review/) (XB1)

>For Honor offers up one of the most visceral multiplayer experiences in video games. The single player campaign is a nice diversion, but won't satisfy those seeking a full experience. Once you hit multiplayer though, you'll be hooked and finding time for other video games will be the real problem.

--------------

**Azralynn** - Azralynn - [77 / 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whHNYrXyutc) | [*Written*](http://www.azralynn.com/review-for-honor-game/) (PC)

>I’m sure some people will be turned off by lack of dedicated servers, and presence of microtransactions in a fully priced game, and I can understand the concerns. However, for those who can look past the somewhat greedy business model, For Honor has an extremely well designed and fun combat system to experience. If you’re a fan of skilled combat with intense swordplay encounters, then you’re likely to enjoy For Honor.

--------------

**Brash Games** - Matthew Smail - [8 / 10](http://www.brashgames.co.uk/2017/02/17/for-honor-deluxe-edition-review/) (PS4)

>Thinking about it, For Honor probably is the game I've been dreaming of since I was about twelve, because it does such a good job of covering all the critical aspects that I associate with medieval warfare that I really have no serious cause for complaint, and if you're in the market for this kind of game, then neither should you!

--------------

**Cerealkillerz** - Gabriel Bogdan - *German* - [7.8 / 10](http://cerealkillerz.org/honor-playstation-4-review-krieg-spielen-der-lite-version/) (PS4)

>For Honor developed from a promising concept to a sloppy execution in the final version. The Story misses some depth and it's still questionable if the game offers some long-term motivation in the Multiplayer-Part.

--------------

**Cheat Code Central** - Jenni Lada - [4 / 5](http://www.cheatcc.com/ps4/rev/forhonorreview.html) (PS4)

>The campaign offers an interesting enough solo experience that lets people gradually face greater challenges. The multiplayer is extraordinary, when it's working properly. It's just that Ubisoft has once again not anticipated the needs of a game such as this. I feel like peer-to-peer wasn't the right system for such a game, and that it would have been better for everyone if this had been a client-server game.

--------------

**Do You Even Game Bro?** - Kieran Stockton - [7.5 / 10](http://www.doyouevengamebro.net/for-honor-review/) (PS4)

>Although the campaign falls well shy of the mark, the innovative Art of Battle system makes for a great multiplayer brawler

--------------

**Game Revolution** - James Kozanitis - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/for-honor) (PC)

>Against all my better instincts, I have to sit down and Ubisoft's dinner table and eat however many crows they put in front of me. Everything but the beak and feat. For Honor is a damn fine experience, and while it's held back by a few technical issues and an underdeveloped campaign, learning and mastering its every complexity is rewarding enough to balance those out and then some.

--------------

**GameCrate** - Angelo D'Argenio - [7.8 / 10](http://www.gamecrate.com/reviews/review-honor-worthy-medieval-brawler/15600) (PC)

>For Honor is a fantastically innovative game that deserves to be played by everyone at least once, but whether or not it ends up being a multiplayer classic is still yet to be seen.

--------------

**GameSkinny** - Synzer - [8 / 10 stars](http://www.gameskinny.com/hojn1/for-honor-review-fighting-done-right)

>For Honor is a brilliant new hybrid fighting game that's only issue is connecting to servers.

--------------

**GameSpace** - Robert Lashley - [7.8 / 10](http://www.gamespace.com/for-honor/review/) (PC)

>For Honor is a gorgeous game filled with brutal combat. At times your armor will become red soaked in the blood of your enemies. PvP is fun and can be fast paced but at times you’ll be best served to slow it down and be more strategic. As an arena sword fighter For Honor does an admirable job but it falls short in supporting an epic campaign. Hopefully the eternal war meta game can keep the players satisfied for the long haul. It’s easy to see the novelty wearing off for a lot of players before the end of the first season.

--------------

**GamingBolt** - Pramath - [7 / 10](http://gamingbolt.com/for-honor-review) (PS4)

>For Honor is, most of all, a fun game, and it is a game that has some real depth and soul to it.

--------------

**GuyLogicGaming** - Dragan Elijas - [Unscored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICOwhrSgRVE)

--------------

**Kotaku** - Ethan Gach - [Unscored](http://kotaku.com/for-honor-the-kotaku-review-1792437162) (PS4)

>Even the most clumsy and gnarled duel will achieve moments of greatness. And when two experienced players operating on the same wave-length begin stringing together slashes, parries and counter-attacks in an unbroken chain, the resulting exchange feels as much like a choreographed ballet as a fight to the death…if ballets ended with severed heads flying into the orchestra.

--------------

**Life is Xbox** - Dae Jim - [90%](http://www.lifeisxbox.eu/2017/02/16/for-honor-review/) (XB1)

>Yes, Ubisoft did it again. Another brand new IP that is good enough to hopefully find a big enough audience. You have to respect the publisher for bringing so many brand new experiences, something that other big publishers fail to do.  For Honor redefines the hack and slash genre with a tactical combat system and addictive online play.

--------------

**PC Gamer** - Andy Kelly - [74 / 100](http://www.pcgamer.com/for-honor-review/) (PC)

>A tense, tactical medieval brawler that will reward anyone with the patience and will to master it.

--------------

**PCMag** - Gabriel Zamora - [Unscored](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2487108,00.asp) (PS4)

>Boasting several action-packed game modes, realistic weapons-based fighting, and appropriately rugged graphics, sword-fighting game For Honor is poised to become the next big PlayStation 4 multiplayer title.

--------------

**PlayStation LifeStyle** - Tyler Treese - [7 / 10](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2017/02/15/for-honor-review-ps4-playstation-lifestyle/) (PS4)

>Judging by how Ubisoft has handled support for past multiplayer games (like Rainbow Six Siege), I’m confident that some of For Honor‘s issues will get rectified down the line. Gameplay can be tweaked, matchmaking enhanced, and better modes can all be added over time. However, as the game stands right now it’s more of a proof of concept than a fully realized idea. There’s a great base to build upon mechanically, but it’s too rough around the edges to shine as bright as it should.

--------------

**Rectify Gaming** - Mike Boccher - [9.2 / 10](http://rectifygaming.com/review-for-honor/) (XB1)

>For Honor is an incredibly competitive multiplayer game and one of the best action titles in years.

--------------

**Rock, Paper, Shotgun** - Brendan Caldwell - [Unscored](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/02/16/for-honor-review/) (PC)

>Overall, I don't know exactly how I feel about For Honor. It sometimes feels like a Ubisoft hired a bunch of scientists in white coats to observe Dark Souls PvP from behind reinforced perspex and experiment on it with Dota DNA in a mad attempt to recreate a tame monster in a safe environment for their own nefarious ends (profit). What they've made is an interesting chimera, something that is both more accessible but sometimes just as unforgiving.

--------------

**Stevivor** - Steve Wright - [9 / 10](http://stevivor.com/reviews/review-for-honor/) (XB1)

>After the utter mess that was For Honor’s networking in closed — and open — betas, we were cautious of online capabilities in this final release. Thankfully, the issues we encountered in both — frequent dropouts, half-populated matches and the like — haven’t shown themselves in the final release. After two solid days of play, across various modes and basically on the hour, we’re confident that Ubisoft has bolstered its backend to ensure For Honor will be a delight to play, not only in mechanics, but over the internet too. For Honor is a refreshing new take on combat, and one that everyone should experience.

--------------

**TrustedReviews** - Tom Orry - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.trustedreviews.com/for-honor-review) (PS4)

>For Honor is a real surprise. In terms of gameplay mechanics it’s top-notch, visually it’s excellent, and there’s a decent if fairly formulaic campaign to play through. It’s in For Honor’s multifaceted multiplayer, however, where Ubisoft has has struck gold. Testing your combat knowledge against real players, either in one-on-one duels or in large conquest-style battles, is both thrilling and unique in the action genre.

>Fighting-game fans looking for something new to become fanatical about will find enough depth here to foster a new obsession, while players who usually stick to thrill-a-minute action will appreciate the extreme tension of battle and rewarding gameplay mechanics. Ubisoft should have another online-focused hit on its hands.

--------------

**TheSixthAxis** - Jim Hargreaves - [8 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/02/17/for-honor-review/) (PS4)

>For Honor joins Rainbow Six Siege, Overwatch, and Destiny, as a game that is destined to grow over time. Right now it offers a strong core experience, but will ultimately be defined by months of rebalancing and a steady flow of new content. Having such a long tail will make For Honor even more enticing further down the line as it continues to snowball. That said, it’s refreshing and addictive enough at present to lure in anyone looking for a multiplayer game that defies the norm.

--------------

**GameMAG** - ACE - *Russian* - [6 / 10](http://gamemag.ru/reviews/for-honor) (PS4)

>For Honor feels like a Free-to-play title that deliberately was turned into a retail product, but kept the elements of a Pay-to-win system. Unfortunately, except for graphics and animations, the single-player mode cannot offer pleasant revelations and the multiplayer mode, instead of beautiful battles, reminds only white trash street fights. The problem with an imbalance of characters in duels makes the situation even worse, but we hope that most errors will be fixed with future updates. If this happens, you can give the game a chance, but for now we recommend postponing the purchase or waiting for discounts to devote time to other more worthy projects.

--------------

**Twinfinite** - Hayes Madsen - [4 / 5](http://twinfinite.net/2017/02/for-honor-review/) (PS4)

>For Honor tries something new, and ultimately succeeds much more than it fails. With its surprisingly fun campaign, intense and challenging gameplay, and varied multiplayer, there’s plenty to keep you busy. There are balancing issues I sincerely hope get worked on, but for now, For Honor is a unique experience well worth your time, and could be the start of a daring new franchise.

--------------

**Eurogamer** - Edwin Evans-Thirlwell - [Recommended](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-02-17-for-honor) (PS4)

>For Honor is a terrific, brutal mix of Ubisoft-brand third-person game design and proven fighting game principles.

--------------

**COGconnected** - Anthony Gomez - [85 / 100](http://cogconnected.com/review/for-honor-review/) (PS4)

>Microtransactions aside, For Honor is a special game. Ubisoft took a huge risk on an intellectual property that offered no guarantees on its financial return; that alone is worthy of applause. But get this, they actually pull it off. They somehow made a medieval fighting game that is intense, smart, rewarding, and demands something of its player. It asks for your patience, yet the glory you’ll receive in return is well worth the trade.

--------------

**CGMagazine** - Cole Watson - [8.5 / 10](http://www.cgmagonline.com/reviews/honor-review-great-western-fighter/)

>For Honor is a great example that Western developers can make some great innovative twists on a primarily Japanese-built genre. It’s so safe for AAA titles to resort to going action, open-world, or FPS, but this is a real risk that Ubisoft is taking on a brand new IP and I hope it pays off for them. This is the best combat system I’ve had the pleasure to experience since the death of character action games. I hope to see you on the battlefield, even if you fight for Valhalla or the Emperor.

--------------

**Generación Xbox** - Gonzalo Sánchez - *Spanish* - [4 / 5](http://generacionxbox.com/analisis-for-honor/) (XB1)

>For Honor is a remarkable game with a deep combat system. The campaign has a cooperative mode for two players and the multiplayer mode will give you tons of hours of fun. For Honor is a safe bet to have fun alone and even more with your friends.

--------------

**PlayStation Universe** - John-Paul Jones - [8.5 / 10](http://www.psu.com/review/32228/for-honor-review) (PS4)

>A small handful of flaws aren’t quite enough to dull the appeal of For Honor’s peerless combat and deceptive depth. For Honor looks like it’ll be my go-to multiplayer game for quite some time and if you give it a go, chances are it’ll be yours, too. For anyone with even the slightest love of melee combat, For Honor is a must-have.

--------------

**The Jimquisition** - Laura Kate - [7 / 10](http://www.thejimquisition.com/for-honor-review/) (PC)

>Ultimately, For Honor doesn’t focus on making sense or being historically accurate, it just puts cool stuff in a field and tells it to go out and fight. Everything outside of playing online sucks, like microtransactions, customization options and single-player. Hell, the multiplayer itself sometimes sucks when it pairs you with a badly selected host player.

>However, when the game is working and you’re murdering a single human player while screaming “FOOOOOOOOOOOR HOOOOOOOOOOOONOOOOOOOOOOOR” at their corpse, it’s pretty damn rewarding.

--------------

**Cubed3** - Ofisil - [7 / 10](http://www.cubed3.com/review/3570/1/for-honor-pc.html) (PC)

>There are lots of bad things that can be said for Ubisoft's newest idea, with the most annoying one being its poor single-player portion. For those looking for the best medieval-themed PvP melee fighting game, however, it just can't get any better than this. For Honor is not flawless, but it's the current King of the Hill.

--------------

**Gadgets 360** - Akhil Arora - [7 / 10](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/for-honor-review-1660738) (PC)

>For Honor is a truly engaging experience when you're out on the battlefield, and playing mind-games with your opponents. It goes beyond its contemporaries by adding depth to combat in a way that feels true to reality. But all of its niceties threaten to be overshadowed by the poor taste of the non-playable elements, which seem to be becoming a bit of norm with top-tier video games.

--------------

**Shacknews** - Jason Faulkner - [8 / 10](http://www.shacknews.com/article/99095/for-honor-review-almost-honorable) (PC)

>For Honor will inevitably be a favorite of mine. It combines easy to pick up, complicated to master fighting and action-style gameplay with compelling gameplay types and there's nothing quite like it. However, if you were looking for a single-player game, you might not want to purchase this title. The heart and soul of For Honor are its multiplayer modes, and unfortunately, at this time, there are enough issues with matchmaking and peer-to-peer connections that you may want to wait until Ubisoft has some time to fix those problems. However, once For Honor has a solid networking backbone I can say it'll be one of my go to multiplayer titles for the next few years to come.

--------------

**Game Informer** - Jeff Cork - [8.3 / 10](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/for_honor/b/playstation4/archive/2017/02/17/battle-scarred-but-victorious.aspx) (PS4)

>For Honor is as close as most of us will get to our sword-and-shield fantasies, and it is amazing when it all works. Unfortunately, networking and interface issues are a chink in its armor

--------------

**Digital Trends** - Phil Hornshaw - [3 / 5 stars](http://www.digitaltrends.com/game-reviews/for-honor-review/)

>'For Honor's dueling is focused and fun, but the best stuff is overshadowed by many smaller problems.

--------------

**We Got This Covered** - Jordan Hurst - [3 / 5 stars](http://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/for-honor-review/) (PC)

>For Honor's tactical, forceful swordplay is extremely well-executed, especially for a first attempt. It's just a shame it's attached to so many distractions, including a bewildering story mode.

--------------

**GameSpot** - Matt Espineli - [8 / 10](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/for-honor-review/1900-6416619/) (PS4, XB1, PC)

>After slaying countless foes, it’s clear the impact For Honor's combat has had; its fundamental tenets of discipline and restraint are bestowed upon you permanently, forever changing the way you perceive a melee-combat encounter in a game. In its highest moments, For Honor is difficult to put down. Its slow combat pace and narrative shortcomings might turn off those unwilling to take the time to dive deep into what it has to offer. However, make no mistake--those who do will be rewarded with some of the most satisfying multiplayer melee fighting conceived in recent years.

--------------

**IGN** - Brandin Tyrrel - [8 / 10](http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/14/for-honor-review) (PS4, XB1, PC)

>For Honor has some dents in its shiny armor, such as the mediocre campaign, the frugal economy, and the snowballing victories in team modes. But it’s hard to be mad too long when I consider that the melee combat system is second to none and a joy to learn, take your licks, and then learn some more. I could feel myself becoming a better warrior with this deep, flexible, and complete fighting system. The more I play For Honor, the more I want to play For Honor. I hope Ubisoft doubles-down on support, because it’s something truly special.

--------------

**Super Bunnyhop** - George Weidman - [Unscored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6Y8QoHQlhI) (PC)

>Thanks to the lock-on camera system and all the animation interpolation going on they've got a pretty decent way to work around the typical issues of playing fighting games online. Because for all my time with it, I never really felt like any perfectly timed parries and blocks weren't registering. But about once a day, I get caught in this loop [gameplay pauses on ""Recovering Gameplay state. Synchronizing..."" screen during an Elimination multiplayer match]. Once one player leaves, everyone else has to wait a bit for everyone to synchronize. Unfortunately, that sometimes makes the whole game break, which is really and truly probably the only thing I don't enjoy about this game. Everything else is peachy; the journey of learning its tricks was one of the most rewarding and compelling processes of learning something intimidating and using what I learned to great effect, but the big problem I foresee with For Honor is that learning curve. This is a very core game where players aren't really going to be competitive, hell, they're not even gonna be viable if they don't watch a bunch of tutorial videos, go down everyone's movelist one by one, practice on the dummies and duel with the bots for hours before really being able to stack up against real players. And with skill disparities that wide, I can also imagine experienced players getting stuck in a rut where new players are so easy that they're boring to fight against and the good players are so untouchably good, why even bother? But the upside to that is that it least those guys will be having a damn good time, and I think I'm pretty sure I've gotten sucked in. I'm going to try to be right there with them over the coming weeks, because there's nothing more satisfying than seeing all that hard work beautifully payoff.

--------------

**Hardcore Gamer** - Chris Shive - [4 / 5](http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2017/02/18/review-for-honor/245661/) (PS4)

>For Honor can be likened to a third-person medieval Call of Duty: the single player campaign is well produced and tells an interesting story, but the bulk of the replay value comes from becoming involved with the Faction War in multiplayer. The Art of Battle gives combat a unique feel setting For Honor apart from other action games and helps reduce the feeling of repetition. Overall the action packed title is an enjoyable ride, whether it is advancing through the single player campaign filled with cinematic cutscenes or battling against other players online. The Faction War is an interesting concept that gives incentive to remain involved with multiplayer long after the campaign is completed, though how well that holds interest will be revealed in time. While there are some imperfections, such as a constant internet connection required and the large amount of grinding required to unlock everything, For Honor is a solid title and recommended for fans of melee combat action titles who want to try a unique twist on a familiar formula.

--------------

**The Overpowered Noobs** - Adam Wheeler - [8 / 10](http://opnoobs.com/reviews/mainstream/action/for-honor) (PC)

>It’s far from perfect, but it does enough right with a cool concept to make it worth your time and money. We’ll see how things progress, but For Honor may have dug out a cool little space for itself in the multiplayer games market that we didn’t know was there.

--------------

**Atomix** - Emilio Reyes - *Spanish* - [82 / 100](http://atomix.vg/2017/02/19/review-for-honor/) (PS4)

>The Art of Battle combat system works better than we expected, giving us a combat multiplayer game full of possibilities and close matches. Ubisoft tried something new and succeeded with a very deep multiplayer experience full of potential.

--------------

**Gameplanet** - Conrad Reyners - [7 / 10](http://www.gameplanet.com.au/playstation-4/reviews/g58aa33f15899b/For-Honor-review/) (PS4)

>The campaign's story falls to earth with a thud, and technical problems are currently marring its online component, but For Honor's masterful presentation and combat rescue it from mediocrity. Given a few patches, it'll be a force to be reckoned with.

--------------

**Critical Hit** - Alessandro Barbosa - [6.5 / 10](http://www.criticalhit.net/review/for-honor-review/) (PS4)

>At its core, For Honor is a stunningly great game with exhilarating combat the likes of which are hardly seen. But it’s crippled by online issues that reduce its core multiplayer to a frustrating mess.

--------------

**Xbox Achievements** - Richard Walker - [83%](http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/for-honor/review/) (XB1)

>A fighting game unlike any other, For Honor is an experience that grows increasingly enjoyable and rewarding the more you play. A game in which Knights, Vikings and Samurai do battle, For Honor is exactly as awesome as it should be.

--------------

**Fortress of Solitude** - Deville Louw - [8.5 / 10](http://www.fortressofsolitude.co.za/game/for-honor-game-review/) (PS4)

>I won’t lie, I died a lot in For Honor. But in death, I learned how to become a better player. For Honor‘s battle system rewards those that take the time to learn it’s nuances and punishes those that don’t.

--------------

**Gaming on PC** - David Dominguez - [7.5 / 10](http://www.gamingonpc.com/reviews/for-honor-review/) (PC)

>For Honor is an excellent multiplayer fighting title held back by poor matchmaking and annoying connection issues. Gamers willing to look past these problems will discover one of the best multiplayer experiences of this generation but less patient players may be discouraged by the title’s technical issues.

--------------

**Sirus Gaming** - David Rix - [8.5 / 10](http://sirusgaming.info/for-honor-review/) (PS4)

>Overall, For Honor is a unique multiplayer experience that brings the art of intimate combat mixed in with the fan faction of your favorite warriors clashing to the death. Ubisoft has another great title under its belt that has a long life ahead of it, with seasons to see which faction is the victor and looming on the horizon is the Events mode, which is sure to add even more of the competitive spirit among player factions. Although, it isn’t without its faults, that doesn’t deter from the quality you are sure to have with the game and the fun of chopping off a vikings head with a samurai’s blade.

--------------

**GearNuke** - Khurram Imtiaz - [9 / 10](http://gearnuke.com/honor-review-ps4/) (PS4)

>For Honor offers a unique online multiplayer experience with its fights that remains unmatched in the current gaming landscape.

--------------

**Saudi Gamer** - مصطفى جاد - *Arabic* - [3 / 5](http://saudigamer.com/review/for-honor/) (PS4)

>For Honor delivers accurate and unique gameplay, unlimited upgrade options for every character, variety in levels design and a multiplayer mode that depends on cooperation with teammates more than playing solo. However, the game suffers from a weak and disappointing story mode, overpowered abilities that some characters have, limited game modes, pay-to-win microtransactions, and various connection issues.

--------------

**GamingTrend** - Rachel Berry - [95 / 100](http://gamingtrend.com/reviews/deadliest-warrior-but-better-for-honor-review/) (PC)

>Whether you prefer, multiplayer or story, Dominion or Duel, viking or knight or samurai, there’s something for every gamer in For Honor. With a compelling story, beautiful customization options, competition, community, this game is both a triumph and a damn good fight.unity, and a damn good fight.

**Metro GameCentral** - GameCentral - [8 / 10](http://metro.co.uk/2017/02/21/for-honor-review-not-just-a-flesh-wound-6462087/) (PS4)

>One of the best new fighting games of the last several years, and all the more exciting because of its originality and accessibility.

--------------

**M3** - P-A Knutsson - *Swedish* - [8 / 10](http://m3.idg.se/2.1022/1.676260/for-honor) (PS4)

>With an outstanding combat system For Honor offers a unique take on medieval action games. The combat truly excels against other players online and it is apparent that the online mode is where your time should be spent. Offline players, however, will not find much to do except hammering around in a repetitive story mode.

--------------

**Worth Playing** - Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus - [7.5 / 10](http://worthplaying.com/article/2017/2/21/reviews/102519/) (PS4)

>For Honor is enjoyable enough, but it feels more like a proof of concept than anything else. The core combat system is interesting, but everything built around it is awkward. When you're in the middle of a dramatic duel against another foe of the same skill level, the game shines. Anything beyond that, and the seams begin to show. It's a game that demands a high skill level for fun and success, and that can be enough to turn off someone. The game is also pretty light on content for the $60 price tag. If you've played the beta and enjoyed For Honor, you'll have a good time, but others may want to find a way to try it out before committing to a full purchase.

**GameSpew** - Richard Seagrave - [8 / 10](http://www.gamespew.com/2017/02/for-honor-review/) (XB1)

>For Honor has quickly become my favourite online multiplayer game, and one that I’m certain will have me honing my skills, and my blade, for months to come.

--------------

**Reno Gazette-Journal** - Jason Hidalgo, Cameron Duren - [3.75 / 5](http://www.rgj.com/story/life/2017/02/21/for-honor-game-review-technobubble/98212444/) (XB1, PC)

>For Honor is a great new IP that takes the fun parts of competitive online shooters and sprinkles them into medieval-style combat. Add excellent visuals to the tight, polished gameplay and you have the makings of a potential esports contender. Unfortunately, microtransactions and free-to-play inspired unlocks take the sheen out an otherwise enjoyable experience. If you don’t mind that, however, then For Honor is good fun.

--------------

**NZGamer** - Brian McDonald - [7.8 / 10](http://nzgamer.com/reviews/2577/for-honor.html) (PS4)

>Held back by its own ambition, For Honor isn’t a masterpiece, but delivers where it counts.

--------------

**Guardian** - Keith Stuart - [4 / 5 stars](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/22/for-honor-review-a-bruising-bloody-and-focused-fighting-sim) (PS4)

>Ubisoft’s multiplayer-focused fighting game is a single-minded simulation of melee battle, with an emphasis on epic physical confrontations

--------------

**USgamer** - Jaz Rignall - [4 / 5](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/for-honor-xbox-one-review) | [*Campaign Overlook*](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/for-honors-campaign-occasionally-fun-but-mostly-underwhelming) (XB1) 

>Mastering For Honor's complex, but brilliant Art of Battle control system takes time and effort, but doing so is very worthwhile. While its campaign is short and rather underwhelming, For Honor's multiplayer really delivers the goods, featuring strategic, involving, and brutal medieval combat that puts you front and center in some truly epic battles. Few games are as gritty and bone-crunching as this.

--------------

**VideoGamer** - Alice Bell - [7 / 10](https://www.videogamer.com/reviews/for-honor-review) (PS4)

>For Honor's multiplayer is special, but as a whole it's let down by the less good single player, sometimes dodgy matchmaking, and a surfeit of microtransactions. The combat, though, is fantastic — it's gutsy and weighty, and you feel like a badass. 

--------------

**Arcade Sushi** - TJ Denzer - [8.5 / 10](http://arcadesushi.com/for-honor-review-playstation-4/) (PS4)

>It doesn't always dance gracefully with the craft of battle, but For Honor is a game that harnesses some of the most impactful melee combat we've seen.

>For Honor is worth the work you have to put into it.

--------------

**LevelUp** - Luis Sánchez - *Spanish* - [6.5 / 10](http://www.levelup.com/PC/juegos/324510/For-Honor/review) (PC)

>For Honor has the best, most innovative and rewarding combat system we have seen in years. However, the whole experience is crippled by poorly designed game modes and progression schemes; a broken matchmaking system and online instability. It's best to avoid it for now and wait a few months until the developer can fix its problems.

--------------

**GameWatcher** - Christian Vaz - [7 / 10](http://www.gamewatcher.com/reviews/for-honor-review/12800) (PC)

> The combat in the game is fantastic, and though the learning curve may be steep, once you get the hang of it you’ll be playing for hours. The first entry in the For Honor series has started strong, I hope a sequel can fill in everything the game currently lacks.

--------------

**AusGamers** - KostaAndreadis - [8 / 10](https://www.ausgamers.com/games/for-honor/review/) (XB1)

>Is this side of the experience, well, good? Definitely, but its longevity will come down to well For Honor can retain its audience. The War of Factions stuff sounds great, but feels lacking in its overall presentation. But there are memorable flashes of brilliance when playing the multiplayer modes, and you come up against another player. And through sheer skill and understanding of the combat, you’re able to gain the upper hand in a heated and intense exchange of metal. And then, put the exclamation point on the outcome with a suitably violent execution. Also, sneaking up on someone to quickly take them out before they can react. Or simply, respecting the Warrior Code and watching two other players duel against the backdrop of AI skirmishes, rain, and all manner of dirt, stone, and fire.

--------------

**ZTGD** - Ken McKnown - [7 / 10](http://www.ztgd.com/for-honor/review/) (XB1)

>For Honor is a unique game with an outstanding combat system. The problems it faces are its release window (I mean look at the games currently out or on the horizon!) and the dedication it requires. Casual players need not apply, as you will be slaughtered endlessly on the battlefield. I feel like For Honor will get a smaller, but highly dedicated fan base as it goes on, but for those looking for an approachable experience will likely fall on their own blade.

--------------

**God is a Geek** - Chris White - [7.5 / 10](http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/for-honor-review/) (PS4)

>If the single-player had been better put together, there would be a lot more to scream and shout about, but the combat and online multiplayer is excellent at times.

--------------

**Destructoid** - Nic Rowen - [5.5 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/review-for-honor-420364.phtml) (PS4)

>I hope in six months I'm excited about For Honor again. I hope people will throw this review back at me later and say For Honor just needed a few tweaks to achieve greatness. As it is, this is a game with a disposable single-player campaign, multiplayer matches that crash or disconnect as often as they complete, and a slew of fantastic mechanics that only rise to the surface in a single game mode out of a half-dozen.

>If there was ever a game to take a ""wait and see"" approach to, it's For Honor

--------------

**Post Arcade (National Post)** - Daniel Kaszor - [8.5 / 10](http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/post-arcade/for-honor-review-close-combat-unlike-any-other-multiplayer-game) (PS4)

>For Honor can be overwhelming, but its deep combat is more welcoming than most shooters

--------------

**Brash Games** - Lewis Dodd - [9 / 10](http://www.brashgames.co.uk/2017/02/23/for-honor-review/) (PC)

>For Honor is a massively entertaining game with a lot of replayability.

--------------

**SelectButton** - Kevin Mitchell - [8 / 10](http://www.selectbutton.com/reviews/for-honor-review/) (PS4)

>Although I never considered myself a competitive fighting game enthusiast, I found both the combat mechanics and the flow of engagement in For Honor refreshing. Individual matches don’t overstay their welcome, and it’s a hard game to put down due to the faction metagame. Seeing your faction losing a territory is a strong incentive to place additional war assets, requiring you to play one more match. Not to mention the game has additional legs with a rewarding loot system and customization options.

--------------

**EGM** - Ray Carsillo - [7 / 10](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/for-honor-review/) (PS4)

>An inventive premise and surprisingly deep combat system sits at the core of what could've been a great game—if so many technical issues didn't surround it and detract so much from the whole of the experience.

--------------

**The Digital Fix** - Andrew Phillips - [7 / 10](http://gaming.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/3953/for-honor.html) (XB1)

>For Honor brings us a surprisingly deep and downright fun co-op / multiplayer fighter held back from greatness by an incoherent, mundane single-player campaign and the use of peer to peer networking for online matches.

--------------

**Telegraph** - Tom Hoggins - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/reviews/honor-review-muscular-multiplayer-combat-makes-war-worth-fighting/) (PS4)

>It is a shame to have to highlight such quibbles, which amount to occasional annoyances rather than game-breakers, but it will be important for Ubisoft and For Honor that they can be resolved. I suspect that this game will follow a similar path to Ubisoft’s equally interesting Rainbow Six Siege, building up a mid-sized, but fervent and dedicated fan-base. And due to For Honor’s ferocious combat system and boldness to do things a little differently, its followers will find a war worth fighting.

--------------

**Easy Allies** - Michael Huber - [4 / 5 stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPOCSZ8aUfA) | [*Written*](https://easyallies.com/#!/review/for-honor) (PS4)

>Fully understanding the nuances of For Honor’s intimate melee combat requires patience and dedication, but players willing to fully commit themselves to mastering the art of battle will be undeniably rewarded. There are still some questions regarding peripheral elements like the Faction War and Ranked Play, and there are some small missteps with the campaign and micro-transactions. However, For Honor brings melee combat to life in a fundamental new way with complex and satisfying mechanics. If you enjoy meaningful victories, For Honor is for you.

--------------

**New Game Network** - Tim Reid - [70 / 100](http://www.newgamenetwork.com/article/1611/for-honor-review/) (PC)

>Even though For Honor's core combat is essentially an elaborate quick-time event sequence in disguise, the production values and novelty factor are high enough that there is still a good deal of fun to be had here.

--------------

**GamesRadar+** - Chris Thursten - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.gamesradar.com/for-honor-review/) (PS4)

>A deep and gratifying medieval swordfighting sim that risks putting off newcomers. Persevere and the rewards are well worth it.

--------------

**TechRaptor** - Matthew Arrojas - [7 / 10](https://techraptor.net/content/honor-review-culture-shock) (PS4)

>The ingredients for a great game are all there in For Honor, and many of those ingredients are put to good use. However, it is by no means a perfect game, and many of its flaws are fatal. There is an audience for For Honor, but it might be more niche than Ubisoft was expecting.

--------------

**PCMag** - Jeffrey L. Wilson - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.pcmag.com/review/351997/for-honor-for-pc) (PC)

>Packed with tense, weapon-based action, For Honor is a fun combat title that shines in its many multiplayer modes. That said, its online requirement and loot system dim its shine a bit.

[IGN] (http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/06/gears-of-war-4-review) : 9.2 - *Review in Progress* (Ryan McCaffrey)
> The five-player Horde mode, however, is once again where Gears’ multiplayer shines brightest. The tower-defense elements introduced in Gears 3 have been iterated on for the better here.

[Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2016/10/6/13162116/gears-of-war-4-review-pc-xbox-one-windows-10) : 9 (Arthur Gies)
>Gears of War 4 is a remarkably complete package.

[EGM](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/gears-of-war-4-review/) : 9 (RAY CARSILLO)
>Gears of War 4 looked at the series’ core formula and figured that if it wasn’t broken, don’t fix it. Most of the additions The Coalition put onto that core simply helped enhance and refine something that was already great. A couple of missteps were made, but this is still a great overall entry in the franchise.

[Attack of the Fanboy](http://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/gears-war-4-review/) : 4.5/5 (William Schwartz)
>Gears of War 4 is exactly what you've come to expect a Gears of War game to be over the years -- an impressive visual showcase in the campaign, with the accompanying competitive and cooperative modes to keep you busy long after the credits roll. Its good to finally see a new Gears of War game on the Xbox One. The wait has been long for Gears of War 4, and now we've seen that the wait has been worth it.

[Game Rant](http://opencritic.com/outlet/60/game-rant) : 4.5/5 (Riley Little)
>Gears of War makes its grandiose return on Xbox One and PC, those sorely missing the series can rest easy knowing that the franchise is back and better than ever.

[GamesRadar+](http://www.gamesradar.com//gears-of-war-4-review/) : 4/5 (David Houghton)
>Gears of War is fresh and exciting again, and its future is potentially even more so.

[Destructoid](https://www.destructoid.com/review-gears-of-war-4-390001.phtml) : 8 (Brett Makedonski)
>The nature of Gears of War 4 is that we won't know its legacy until there are more games in the canon. That's frustrating now but it'll hopefully be exciting later. This was a fine first showing but it'd be nice to see The Coalition carve its own identity for Gears of War. Using Epic's foundation is understandable and expected, but it often feels like a crutch. Marcus' boy had grown up just like him.

[The Jimquisition ] (http://www.thejimquisition.com/gears-of-war-4-review/) : 7 (Jim Sterling)
>The combat of the campaign is fundamentally sound, the multiplayer is well crafted as always (despite the usual shotty problem), and Horde mode is great entertainment. As a complete package, the game is worthy, if only for the fact it’s a Gears game and the true heavy lifting was already done by Epic in 2006.
Nevertheless, the campaign is flimsy, and despite claims of signifying a new generation for the series, Gears of War 4 is ultimately an upholder of the status quo.

[GameSpot] (http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gears-of-war-4-review/1900-6416538/) : 7 (Mike Mahardy)
>Gears of War 4 makes the best of the franchise's multiplayer modes, but delivers a lackluster campaign in the process.

[Eurogamer](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-10-06-gears-of-war-4-is-smarter-than-it-is-sensational) : Early impressions (Edwin Evans-Thirlwell)
>The Coalition's campaign is a sensitive and opulent retreading of some classic concepts and themes.

[PC Gamer](http://www.pcgamer.com/gears-of-war--4-pc-review/) : Review in Progress (Wes Fenlon )
>A gorgeous campaign that plays it too safe and ends up feeling far too familiar.

>It’s crazy that Bioware did the hard part so well and created a system of combat and movement that I absolutely love, while failing nearly everywhere else. Hopefully, Anthem can be fixed and with any luck, Bioware will look to Diablo 3 for inspiration, not Destiny, because that’s where the true potential lies.

>At this point in time, Anthem feels like a title that needs more work. I want to like it, but damn does it make it hard. Like the games that came before it in this genre, I’ve no doubt that Anthem will get better and bulkier with updates over time, but if Bioware takes too long in getting there, I fear most of the player base will have moved on.

>Even if it has some good ideas, plays very well and is dashing technically speaking, Anthem is a huge disappointment. Because of its repetitivity and lack of real of real attractiveness in terms of story and characters, it feels more like a technological showcase without a soul.

>Wearing armor and fighting like the Iron Man is really amazing, but this game at this time is also full of flaws. The story is dull. The gameplay is repetitive and boring. What's worse, there are too many bugs and network issues. Maybe it will be a great game when its DLCs come out.

>Anthem's technical shortcomings, dull combat and pretty but messy environments combine poorly with a narrative that uses pointless binary conversation choices, a thoroughly typical, snarky protagonist and worn out tropes to fuel it's characterization and plot. These elements come together to make Anthem a chore of a game that's highly unlikely to satisfy anyone but the most desperate groups of loot motivated gamers in it's current state.

>The controls of Anthem are intuitive and engaging. Flying through the world of Bastion is a sight to behold, and coordinating with your team on higher difficulties like Grandmaster is rewarding. Despite some questionable design choices and shortcomings, Anthem has a strong foundation that has potential to be a genre leader, but isn't quite there just yet.

>Anthem is a frustrating experience. There's a core gameplay idea that's fun, but it's not enough to keep the experience alive in endgame and beyond. It wants to sell us on flying and combat, but Grandmaster levels stop that dead. It offers a wide world to explore, but offers no reason to do so. Anthem ultimately doesn't feel like the best BioWare can do, and that's a horrible shame.

>The problem for Halo fans who are interested in the whole package is the stark dichotomy between the game's two halves. Halo 5’s campaign is forgettable. Its multiplayer, on the other hand, is a return to what made Halo 2 and Halo 3 multiplayer so popular.

>If it weren't for Warzone, Halo 5: Guardians would probably be somewhere on the lower end of the franchise's spectrum for me. It's still a fantastic and well-oiled machine, but the story falls flat, and the shift in gameplay mechanics result in the loss of some elements that made the series so unique in the first place. Still, if you're looking to shoot some dudes online, Guardians is your huckleberry.

>Bottom Line: Halo 5 proves that 343 is a worthy team for taking over the Mantle of Responsibility for the Halo series from Bungie. Recommendation: Halo 5 isn't exactly friendly to those who aren't familiar with Halo's lore, making the game a tough entry point to the series as far as campaign is concerned, but for everyone else, Halo 5 is yet another stellar entry in the legendary shooter franchise.

>Perhaps the most important thing to say about Halo 5's campaign is it's a substantial improvement on Halo 4's campaign, which I've always maintained was a decent first effort from a new developer still finding its feet. Halo 5's missions do not revolutionise the FPS genre, or even the Halo series, but they are a welcome return to form. For me, that's good enough.

Both in multiplayer and campaign, there are additions and iterations in almost every area, and even veteran players will find a fresh experience waiting for them.

There are parts that let us down, particularly the story, but it’s hard to feel too stung when there’s just so much fun to be had.

>In its 14 years, Halo has never felt so good to play. An updated arsenal and great new mobility mechanics give both campaign and multiplayer and modern touch without sacrificing Halo’s classic feel. It fails to introduce its new Spartan characters in a meaningful way, and the story does make some odd logical leaps, but it’s still fast, beautiful, and fun – especially with four-player co-op. Guardians’ multiplayer harkens back to the Halo 2 glory days with tons of balanced maps and fun modes, and the tactical new Warzone mode absolutely steals the show.

>Halo 5 isn’t quite the whole package that Halo fans are used to. The campaign never sells its narrative of a big, tense chase. Instead it’s a drawn-out, forced experience that stops short before it has a chance to get interesting. Multiplayer, for whatever that’s worth to you, is Halo 5’s saving grace.

Otherwise, Halo 5 excels under the pressure, providing one of the most welcoming, competitive, balanced and fun games of the year — and providing my personal favorite Halo multiplayer since the series began.

>Halo fans won’t need convincing to pick this one up, so to newcomers of the series, now is a fine time to jump in – so long as you’re prepared for significant background reading beforehand if you want to engage with the story. For those of you that previously had little interest in the Halo games, Halo 5: Guardians has been streamlined and tweaked just enough to make the experience feel familiar to fans of modern FPS’s whilst still retaining the classic Halo essence. If you have an Xbox One, Halo 5:Guardians is well worth your time.

>The campaign mode hits some great highs over its somewhat short 15-mission span, but also occasionally suffers from a lack of variety, and some boss fights that feel disappointingly one-note. Halo 5: Guardians' strength is found in its PvP. Arena and Warzone offer two distinctly different flavors of action, and both are solid, very well designed, and a lot of fun to play. Ultimately, campaign is a good way to ease you into the game - but it's the PvP that delivers the best of what this game has to offer.

>Halo 5 could well prove to be the return to form that Halo fans have been waiting for. Not all of the changes will prove popular with the Halo fan base - Halo 5 is a surprisingly stand-out Halo title in this respect, introducing a lot of changes, both subtle and in-your-face. It discards series tropes with confidence and stands tall as a testament to what can happen when a series embraces the new without detracting from the best of the old. Halo 5 is, at this early stage, my favourite Halo title to-date, and I honestly never thought I would say that after being so deflated by Halo 4. If you own an Xbox One, you owe it to yourself to own Halo 5.

But if you do, there is a ton of replayability here. The story mission modes are excellent, the co-op is fantastic, and the Ghost Mode is something that I think a lot of players are really gonna enjoy.

It’s the best Hitman game so far, and I’d absolutely recommend it wholeheartedly. It’s just a bit of a shame that they didn’t take some more chances, in favour of offering up a slice of the same excellent stealth gameplay. At this early stage, before IO Interactive has dropped in the returning Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts and bonus missions, it’s hard to see the full scope of Hitman 2. Right now, it’s more of the same, but that isn’t enough to deny it an enthusiastic recommendation.*||

It doesn’t do much to improve on the original formula, but the original formula is still fun and exciting enough to carry the game when combined with IO Interactives attention to detail, level design, and NPC AI. The whole game feels like you’re wandering around living, breathing environments that are built to challenge your skills and creativity as an assassin, but that manages to do so in a way that feels fun and addicting even after multiple runs through the same level.*|PC|

The game lacks some of the refinement expected of a world-class assassin, but the top-notch level design and some small, but key improvements to the series' core mechanics more than make up for a few presentation and polish issues.

It may not be a monumental step forward for the franchise, but the number of features and adjustments that are made only help create a more gratifying and highly-captivating experience. It helps that while the plot is just there to be a bridge between scenarios, IO Interactive links everything together with intelligently-designed contextual storytelling which is found throughout each area. Unfortunately, there’s only five missions, not counting the five to ten-minute long prologue that acts as a tutorial. At least these missions are bigger than ever before, some even taking over an hour to complete, all of which include an impressive amount of ways to take down your targets. There aren’t any missions that could dethrone the top 3 of Hitman Season 1, but instead what we get is a solid assortment that will leave you wanting more. We may not get as many highs, but at least we get fewer lows. It’s also a shame that this is still bogged down with online connectivity requirements, something that’s to the game’s detriment. Even with its share of issues, Hitman 2 hits it mark, creating an addictive, overly-ambitious sequel.*|PS4|

It's meticulous in its scoring system, objectives, and unlocks. Even though this would have worked perfectly as a ""season two"" for the original Hitman, the need for a new package is perfectly understandable given their situation. I don't even need the Sean Bean and company timed challenges or the promising now-in-beta Ghost Mode (an asymmetrical gametype where you try to kill more targets than an opponent that exists in an alternate reality): just keep giving me more maps and I'll keep playing.*|PS4|

Complex, intricate locations are rewarding to explore, while pulling off the perfect assassination remains one of the highlights of the stealth genre. In the coming weeks, Sean Bean will play the role of an elusive target, and hopefully, Ghost Mode will expand on its promising premise. A few uninspired locations and cliché targets hold back the proceedings, but Hitman 2 hits the mark.* [Written](https://easyallies.com/#!/review/hitman-2)|PS4|

A part of me still longs for the smaller and more digestible maps of the older games, but I can’t argue with IO’s execution here – the levels, and memorable assassination opportunities they hold, are worth the investment.*|PS4|

The developer's uncertain future under* *Square Enix* *made a fair number of headlines a while back, before IO went independent and became the sole master of Agent 47's destiny. The fact that Hitman 2 turned out as well as it did in spite of that business turmoil is a great sign for the future of the franchise, and we should all be fortunate enough to get to play another one of these games a couple of years from now* |XB1, PS4|

But that’s not a bad thing. By offering more of the deepest, fullest stealth sandboxes in gaming in one single package rather than six episodic ones, it earns its keep. The inclusion of Hitman (2016) is a bonus for those that didn’t catch the reboot initially. Here’s hoping they put more effort into the plot next time.*|PS4, XB1, PC|

And it's totally acceptable as it is still efficient. There's a lot things to do/observe/infiltrate/kill/hide/use in each huge and beautiful level, and it is indeed a great assassin simulation, even if the game has not many things more to offer in terms of gameplay compared to its predecessor, and feels a bit like a ""1.5 version"". Accept its rules and you will be pleased, for a long time.*||

>Ubisoft's true new-gen innovation has been to make a real place for one of their templated games to play out in. That game might be entirely (and occasionally dully) familiar, but the scenery is like little else we've encountered before. Ubisoft's been Forrest Gump-ing history for years in an attempt to get us to engage with it, but we've never felt more like we were a part of the old world than in just walking those streets.

>As the seventh major instalment in the series, though, not to mention the first designed for new console hardware, Assassin's Creed Unity feels like a missed opportunity. Going back to basics at this point may have resulted in a less substantial game than recent years have led us to expect, but it might have delivered a more satisfying one. As it is, mild improvements in traversal and combat are quickly overwhelmed by the creaking systems onto which they have been grafted. Revolutionary Paris is one of the most beautifully realised environments in a series that has had its fair share of them, but the game you play doesn't really do it justice.

>The ingredients are all here for a spectacular new standard for the series on Sony and Microsoft's new machines. But in the quest to build something that looked and sounded ""next generation,"" Ubisoft Montreal failed to fix the problems that have accumulated over so many annual release. Combined with an uninspiring story, and a long list of considerable technical problems, Unity falls short of the fresh start Assassin's Creed needs.

[Gamesradar](http://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-unity-review/?utm_source=Social&utm_medium=Twitter&utm_campaign=Owned): 4/5

>Unity manages to push the series forward enough to make this truly great, it’s only sad that a few left over hiccups have carried over from the previous generation. Traditional Creed problems aside, this manages to be an unrivalled murderous sandbox and Paris hands over a visually impressive blood drenched historical playground.

[IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review): 7.8

>Assassin’s Creed Unity leverages the new-generation consoles to add spectacular new sights and successful co-op multiplayer, but in doing so, it’s created some substantial new problems instead of solving the series’ most persistent ones. The scope is stunning, the customization is satisfying, and the multiplayer touches upon some really ambitious ideas. But the lack of a strong main character or interesting take on the Assassin’s Creed universe costs it momentum and excitement, and the persistent control problems are still a thorn in its side. The first truly new-gen Assassin’s Creed game is a gorgeous, entertaining, and successful proof of concept for what lies ahead for the series, though it isn’t what I’d call revolutionary.

>They made what amounts to a showpiece for a new graphics engine, a game that will initially turn heads but which quickly reveals itself to be frustrating, repetitive, and dull.

[Total Xbox](http://www.totalxbox.com/82438/reviews/assassins-creed-unity-xbox-one-review/): 8

>In many ways, Unity feels like the sequel Brotherhood should have had three years ago. This may not appeal after life on the open seas, but we can safely say that despite initial hesitation - will Paris just feel like a retextured Italy? - we had hours of fun. Sure, AC can't shake fiddly missions and fiddlier parkour, but it'll take a long time for the intrigue, the beauty and the lovable silliness to wear off. It's a huge, well-realised and incredibly detailed city that we love spending time in. So listen to Shaun and forget the mud and grot and misery of Les Misérables: Unity is a different kind of revolution.

[Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review-a-tale-of-two-games/): 2.5/5

>Assassin's Creed Unity is the best and worst of Assassin's Creed. It's hard not to appreciate everything that it gets right, and you'll have a good time if you can wrangle some friends for co-op, but it's impossible to ignore where Unity falls tragically short.

[Game Informer](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_unity/b/xboxone/archive/2014/11/11/game-informer-review-assassins-creed-unity.aspx): 8

>Inordinately long load times, repeated onscreen notifications, and a couple of hard freezes prove that Unity is a complex game that hasn’t yet had all of its bugs smashed. However, Unity’s frequent missteps are balanced against an astonishing array of engaging content set in a stunning world. Even as I tallied problems, I marveled at the game’s breadth of gameplay and richly realized world. I encourage fans to give Unity a try, and leave your expectations at the door. For both better and worse, Assassin’s Creed is moving in a new direction.

>But is it the next-gen Assassin's Creed game we've all been waiting for? Not quite. It's very good, maybe even great in places, but the story's smaller focus has come at the expense of its exquisitely rendered backdrop. The grandness and spectacle that so often graces the finest Assassin's Creeds is sadly sorely lacking here.

[USGamer](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/assassins-creed-unity-xbox-one-review): 3.5/5

>Unity attempts to improve on some of Assassin's Creed's innate problems, but it misses the mark as often as it hits. Nevertheless, you'll want to play it for the gorgeous rendition of revolutionary (etc.) France and the involving, opened-ended primary assassination missions. It's clear Ubisoft is trying to shake up the series a bit, but next time they need to shake a little harder.

Translation of the source article in Spanish (link at the bottom)

> Sony Japan has just registered a new patent that allows the retrocompatibility of the hardware with previous consoles. It is a system to be applied in a future machine, PS5, and that allows the CPU of the new console to be able to ""interpret"" the central unit of the previous machines. The author of the development was Mark Cerny, the architect who designed the PS4 structure, and the patent, which has been filed under number 2019-503013, briefly explains what it consists of. 

> The aim is to make the applications designed for the previous consoles (legacy device) run perfectly on the most powerful hardware, and is focused on eliminating the synchronization errors between the new consoles and the behavior of the previous ones (PS4, PS3, PS2 and PSX). For example, if the CPU of the new console is faster than the previous one, data could be overwritten prematurely, even if they were still being used by another component. 

> Thanks to the new system, PS5 would be able to imitate the behavior of the previous consoles, so that the information that arrives at the different processors is returned in response to the ""calls"" of the games. The processor is able to detect the needs of each application and behave as if it were the original ""brain"" of each machine, cheating the software. This technology does not prevent PS5 could also have additional processors to have compatibility with machines whose architecture is difficult to replicate, as in the case of PS2. 

> In [this blog](http://blog.hokanko-alt.com/archives/54822370.html) you can see the most detailed information of the patent, with the diagrams in Japanese. Yesterday we explained the SRGAN process that allows you to perform ""remastering by emulation"" (another of the elements that Sony has patented, and converts images in SD resolution in 4K using artificial intelligence.

We believe that the overwhelming majority of the 4,000+ PS4 titles will be playable on PS5.

> We’re expecting backward compatible titles will run at a boosted frequency on PS5 so that they can benefit from higher or more stable frame rates and potentially higher resolutions. We’re currently evaluating games on a title-by-title basis to spot any issues that need adjustment from the original software developers.

> In his presentation, Mark Cerny provided a snapshot into the Top 100 most-played PS4 titles, demonstrating how well our backward compatibility efforts are going. We have already tested hundreds of titles and are preparing to test thousands more as we move toward launch. We will provide updates on backward compatibility, along with much more PS5 news, in the months ahead. Stay tuned!

>In an interview with @WeeklyFamitsu today we confirmed #RatchetPS5 will offer an option to play at 60fps!

Translated via DeepL:

>**--I understand. Also, what frame rates and resolutions are supported?**

>Mike: *Increasing the visual aesthetics and decreasing the frame rate is a tricky balance to strike in any game. This title focuses on balancing the comfort of the action with the beauty of the graphics, while still allowing players to choose from two different resolutions and frame rates. One is a 4K resolution at 30FPS, and the other is a lower resolution at 60FPS. Players will be able to choose between these two options.*

>Ishidate: *I'd like to add that in Ratchet & Clank, starting in the latter half of the PS3 era, we've chosen to ditch the 60FPS of the PS2 era for 30FPS in order to make the graphics more beautiful, and the actual gameplay has been made at 30FPS. This time around, players can choose whether to go the 60FPS route of the PS2 era or the high resolution & 30FPS route of the PS3 and beyond.*

[Famitsu interview](https://www.famitsu.com/news/202008/28204823.html):

>――わかりました。また、対応しているフレームレートや解像度についても教えてください。

>マイク: 映像の美しさを高めるとフレームレートが落ちるというのは、どのゲームでもバランスが悩ましいところです。本作はアクションの快適さと美しいグラフィックのバランスを重視しつつ、プレイヤーが解像度とフレームレートを2種類から選べる仕組みにしています。ひとつは“4K解像度で30FPS”で、もうひとつが“60FPSでより低い解像度”。このどちらかを選択できるようになる予定です。

>石立: 私から補足させていただくと、PS3後半からの『ラチェット＆クランク』は、PS2時代の60FPSを捨てて30FPSにすることでグラフィックを美しくする選択をしてきまして、実際にゲームプレイも30FPS前提で作られてきました。それが今回は、PS2時代の60FPS路線か、それともPS3以降の高解像度＆30FPS路線かをプレイヤーが選んでいただけるというものになっています。",1598624770.0
