i1rhdh,Tstinzy,"When a developer says the game “supports” 120fps I think at launch very few will run 4K120fps.

1) This suggested that Sony's initial cost plan was below that figure, which suggested they may have been aiming for a similar RRP as the PS4

2) With the sudden increase in PS5 production, it might suggest Sony has managed to reduce the BOM costs down to the level of their initial estimations. 

This digitimes article outlines that PS5 production is going smoothly, with many hands being cut in:

>AMD-designed processors for the device fabricated by TSMC on its 7nm node and packaged by ASE Technology and Siliconeware Precision Industries (SPIL) with its FCBGA process are already being delivered to Sony, and shipments of peripheral chipsets are expected to peak later in the third quarter to support first wave of terminal sales in the fourth quarter, the sources continued.

>Taiwan's chipmaker ZillTek Technology and China's AAC Technologies now share Sony's orders for handle controller chips for PS5, and another two Taiwanese IC designers Nuvoton Technology and Genesys Logic are supplying MCUs and USB hub controllers, respectively, for the device, with Greatek Electronics as their backend partner.

I think there will be a $/£/€100 difference between the two entirely to get people into the complete Sony ecosystem.   

If you take the view that games cost the consumer the identical amount whether digital or physical (not entirely far from reality) then digital sales represent far more income to Sony than the equivalent volume of physical sales will. This is why they have a digital console and why they will probably look to push it more and more. That saving for a digital console will roughly bag you a second controller and a game compared to having just the physical console from Sony whilst also giving Sony more profit.  

Under digital sales Sony get all the income that the brick & mortar store you buy a physical would get, without the 'cost' of a store set-up and item delivery too.",57,1595862853.0,/r/PS5/comments/hyqoio/ps5_shipments_may_reach_120_million_in_the_next_5/

iauv25,LocusAintBad,"TLDR: Some key points. 

1. Dev states he started working with Microsoft first and then Sony and said that Microsoft was difficult to work with. 

2. Said that Microsoft doesn’t allow certain genres of games to be made because they don’t sell well. 

3. Said the 4K rumor is pure bullshit and some devs have been playing with even 8K resolution. 

4. SSD is about 60 times faster at loading than the 7200HDD. 

5. Sony treat their devs better and allow them to go with their creative directions and support their decisions  

6. Game he’s talking about should be out around October.

7. The new generation of consoles will be able to achieve new levels of AI with the extra power

8. “Expect space to become an issue on next gen consoles.” He says that games will be using more textures, more shading, bigger levels, higher resolutions and more intensive space taking features. (Yikes)

9. NDAs have made it a weird time for indie developers being unable to talk with each other like normally so they haven’t been able to share anything with other indie devs.

10. No studio is allowed to confirm or deny that they have a dev model or working PS5.

11. That backwards compatibility was officially announced vaguely so he wants to keep it vague with his answers but that unless “It’s a game that only one person has downloaded then I wouldn’t worry about not being able to play your current games on the PS5”

12. “From a devs perspective pre order a PS5 if you want the best players experience. You will regret getting a series X because Microsoft just doesn’t deliver that level of player experience” also says that “Maybe once a year you’ll see an Xbox game when you own a PlayStation and go wow I really wish I had that but on the Xbox it’s every few weeks or months that they have to see these quality exclusive titles and say wow I wish I had a PlayStation to play that”

13. When asked about pre orders he said he can’t disclose any information but that it would be wise to try to reserve a pre order now. He said that Curry’s, and Amazon UK are places you can reserve a pre order of the console as well as Best Buy, Walmart, and Amazon US if you live there and that even with the large amount of estimated systems being manufactured that Covid-19 has shut down some parts factories for 3+ months so that it would be wise to reserve a pre order.

14. The game he’s developing is Costume Kingdom and he says that as long as there is no licensing fees to upgrade the PS4 version to the PS5 then he doesn’t want to charge anyone for the upgrade. He said if it comes down to them needing to pay a licensing fee he’ll email the buyers of the game to let them know that’s what is happening.",486,1597596460.0,/r/PS5/comments/iauv25/playstation_dev_live_interview_live_right_now/

Yep. For all the talk about Phil Spencer being a gamer and ""one of us"", there's a million interviews where he seems stuck in his belief that the games need to fit the service they're developed for and the market at the time, rather than just letting developers decide what's best of their specific talents and creative process. He's not a proponent of true creativity and soulsearching. That's why Xbox Games Pass is going to indirectly hurt the creativity of developers who are specifically making games for Microsoft.",58,1597597389.0,/r/PS5/comments/iauv25/playstation_dev_live_interview_live_right_now/

The S is $300. To people who follow the industry it's clear why that is. It's a weaker console.

But your average consumer, the majority of Sony's and MS' consumer base, don't know that.

So Sony's digital PS5 might face some issues here, since the price will probably be higher than $300. An average consumer will walk into a store, see 2 next gen consoles without a disc drive and simply go for the cheaper one.

If they can price the digital edition at $300, it'll make them competitive. I doubt that'll happen.

fjjvtv,steppenwolfmother,Windows central has an article about how the system manages to perform like a 25 TFLOP machine with raytracing on.

fjjvtv,c_will,"They're going all out at this point. They had the console reveal video during the Game Awards, the blog post with an overview and some new features a few weeks ago, and today they've unveiled the following: 

* Detailed spec sheet, including clock speeds/bandwidth/RAM
* Controller details
* Videos showing Quick Resume, Loading times, and Ray Tracing
* Hands on with the console, SoC, and internal design. 
* I/O, including expandable SSD based storage

It's all pretty amazing, especially the fact the Zen 2 CPU cores are going to be running at 3.8 Ghz, and 3.66 Ghz with multithreading. The GPU also comes out to actually be about 12.155 TFs, which is just insane. Microsoft is definitely confident in the Series X, and for good reason. 

Admittedly though, as a PS fan this is just making me more frustrated with Sony's silence. It's hard to tell whether they have their own plan and are just keeping quiet to build hype, or if there are problems behind the scenes. Either way I don't know how they can continue to remain silent while Microsoft is just putting out so much information on Series X.",111,1584368917.0,/r/PS5/comments/fjjvtv/xbox_just_released_full_specs_and_tech_demos_of/

Edit:

1. I didn't realize double ended USB-C was a common thing until today, so I **still can** charge both my phone and controller simultaneously with PS5. Problem solved!

2. All my old USB-C cords are [USB-C to A](https://www.mytrendyphone.fi/images/Dux-Ducis-K-ONE-Type-C-Charging-Cable-2-1A-3m-6934913096635-28022019-01.jpg).

3. That's why I thought I couldn't charge my phone and controller simultaneously - because PS5 only has one USB-A port.

4. After dozens of people point it out, I quickly understand that USB-C to C is a widespread thing, and PS5 will probably even ship with one. Sounds great!

5. Also, **yes** I have a phone charger with wall socket adapter, but I prefer to just use the [cable](https://www.mytrendyphone.fi/images/Dux-Ducis-K-ONE-Type-C-Charging-Cable-2-1A-3m-6934913096635-28022019-01.jpg) to charge through PS4, because it's a convenient place for me.

Confirmation : 

>	Just like the Xbox Series X, the PS5 can be placed vertically or horizontally underneath a TV or monitor. Sony has built a stand that works for either orientation, and the company is using what looks like a slightly different stand for the Digital Edition of the PS5. The top of the PS5 unit also appears to include vents for heat dissipation, with USB-A and USB-C ports at the front.

Like... Everyone was hyped and watching this event. Price, console details, release date. We've been waiting. No pre-order date? Fine. I can wait for whenever those details come. So long as I have time to be ready to pre-order at the first chance. 

But don't have pre-orders start less than 12 hours later and announced via Twitter, which I don't even have!!! I feel like I'm crazy here.

iudjk8,AggieGator16,"Retail Executive here: 
Don’t give up hope if you missed out so far, here’s why: 

In order for a retailer (Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, etc) to pre sell an item (in the US at least) by law they must have a unit (in this case a PS5) to “set aside” as purchased by you. Retailers are taking risks here because they are trusting Sony to follow through on production.
What has happened up to this point is Sony has manufactured X # of PS5s to date. Let’s pretend it’s 100 for simplicity. Sony might keep 25 to sell themselves, they might give 25 to Amazon, 10 to Best Buy, so on and so forth. 

Retailers already have agreements with Sony for a total # of Day 1 units they have wholesale purchased. However due to the nature of manufacturing, that doesn’t mean all 10 units Best Buy have actually been physically manufactured yet. (In retail we refer to this as “On Order” units)

Until units have physically been manufactured, tested, and approved by Sony/Factory, they MAY NOT be counted towards a retailers current available inventory to even be pre sold. 

It is HIGHLY likely that retailers have only sold out of the units that Sony has already manufactured, and can 100% guarantee will be available day 1. 

However there is still over 1 month until launch. Sony can manufacturer ALOT of PS5s from now until then. As more units get produced, retailers will be able to confirm that this additional inventory may be pre sold once again. 

BUT Buyers that work for these retailers are not going to be checking this every single day, it’s simply too tedious to change the website from “Out of stock” to “Pre order available” every single day. So they will wait (usually a week) for guaranteed inventory to build up and then hit the “Green light” on it. 

I would expect this to occur at least 2-3 more times before launch. Still requires some luck and paying attention but all hope is not lost. 

It is also important to know that OMNI channel retailers (those who run websites and stores) separate the Inventory between the two. So if online is sold out, that doesn’t mean every Best Buy is sold out. It also works the same for the replenishment of pre order inventory. As more are produced and handed over to Best Buy, they will choose to sell some  online and allocate the rest to physical stores. So checking in with your local retailers every so often will do you wonders. 

In some cases it’s even possible to develop relationships with managers and they can call you when they hear more units could come available. It always pays to treat retail employees nicely. Hope this helps put some minds at ease.",66,1600367058.0,/r/PS5/comments/iudjk8/sony_dont_worry_well_give_you_notice_for/

Announce the preorder event days ahead so real consumers can fight with the scalpers at checkout. These are relatively simple measures to help minimize the success of scalpers.

Since the big stores do not care about the consumers, this will not happen. Sadly, no economic incentive exists for the big stores to add these features because manufacturers force the retail prices to be locked. Thus, consumers get screwed.

Cheats and tricks. Particles? Same deal. This new technology would allow us to use geometry with all it's million little details as-is. To put it in perspective: even VFX studios have to optimize their models but they use ginoirmous renderfarms to render the images. For this to do it in real time without optimized geometry?

>  
>Connector is reversible meaning you don’t have to fiddle with it turning it back an forth wondering if you are inserting it in the right direction  
>  
>USB C can carry 100W at 20V and 5A. What does this mean? You can now charge a laptop via the USB C port. Previous versions of USB only carried enough power to charge cell phones and tablets.  
>  
>USB C supports speeds of up to 10Gbs. While this might not mean much to most people…the easiest way to understand it is you can drive multiple 4K monitors and connected devices like hard drives all through a single port.

TLDR: It's flippable, charges faster, and carries more data. It's also a lot more durable.

Edit: this is just a basic explanation of the benefits of USB Type C supporting USB 3.1. I'm not trying to justify it being on the controller.",119,1586294544.0,/r/PS5/comments/fwrkep/introducing_dualsense_the_new_wireless_game/
fwrkep,nysecret,"For starters, usb-c is reversible, there’s no wrong way to insert it and while that may seem like a small luxury it fucking rules not having to think about orienting your cable. Usb-c also offers faster charging and data transfer and is becoming the industry standard being adapted by Apple, Nintendo, and many others, so you’re more likely to be able to charge your devices using the same cables. And if that’s not enough, USB-C is much more durable and breaks far less frequently than previous usb connectors.",295,1586294553.0,/r/PS5/comments/fwrkep/introducing_dualsense_the_new_wireless_game/

Vacuum holes to clean heatsink without needing any tools to access is GREAT.  

That stand is fucking neat, and is included.  

That's a very big single fan (surprised) that can't really be blocked due to the ""collars"" design of the side panel, which is smart.  

The heatsink thermal mass is fucking huge. Heat pipes are a kind of vapor chamber, for those wondering. Same basic state change principle.  

Liquid metal thermal coupling surprised me. That in a consumer product (two years of testing) isn't something I was expecting.  

This whole thing should not only be quiet, but should remain quiet. The thermal compound won't degrade, the heatsink is easy to clean, and the shape of the thing allocates good airflow for itself. Very intelligent design, they've put big focus on it compared to last time around.

j2vbgt,SylphKnot,"God I hope I don’t get wooooshed, but in reality everything really kind of *is* a mirror, and it’s a pretty cool thing to think about! Efficient Ray tracing is our next biggest step to replicating just how light works in the real world, but in a virtual space! And much quicker than we used to be able to do it :D 

but light is always bouncing and reflecting off surfaces. But some materials absorb more various colors than others. Even with a mirror, though we don’t really see it, there’s some color lost in the reflection. But it bounces back a lot more of the light and color than say, a sidewalk, which absorbs a lot of color, and scatters the light more than a mirror, which bounces light back pretty darn straight (except for those wonky carnival mirrors)

Idk if that’s the best explanation.

Again, hope I don’t get wooooshed, or even better, I hope that a fellow Spider-Man fan (or not fan, I don’t judge) gets a spark of curiosity on how light works in our world! It’s pretty crazy

EDIT: a short video that kind of loosely explains how light is reflected and absorbed to create color :)

You’re definitely right about that, and as a developer I like to think it’s the new crysis effect where they want to push this to the limit to see how far they can bend it till it breaks.

I just hope if there is little competition, sony still keeps up the high quality of 1st party games and dont start slacking

Edit: thankyou for the upvotes and general positivity. I just wanted to clear 2 things up based on some replies

1 )Im not bashing the ps5 or attempting to diminish its power too by mentioning power advantage. I meant it as it being a feature that microsoft can use to market the series x that may attract more kids/power players who would like the idea of having the ""worlds most powerful console"". As on paper, that is the truth although the games do need to show that which i understand but it is a different argument that can only be answered after launch.

2) For gamepass, I have only ever used the £1 month on my pc for it and found it to be decent. I mentioned gamepass as from what I have read in general online and also from my xbox friends, people tend to praise it alot and say it is better than PsNow. 
On the topic of ps now, the last time I tried it was several years ago not too long after it launched and I found it to not be the best experience but from what ive heard apparently its became much better so I will try it again and see if it changes my previous point.",205,1596037836.0,/r/PS5/comments/i02wfl/over_half_of_gamers_in_the_uk_intend_to_buy_a/

Fast load times, no need to load once you boot up the console, optimized games, wide range of choice of titles for everyone, racing games, sci fi, historical settings, 3rd person shooters, 1st person shooters, immersive sims, and way more mixed genres (that game set in a horror Tokyo, the cartoonish one with the girl and those black rounded animals, project athia and way more).

>*""First, a quick look at the two titles I was able to play, ASTRO's PLAYROOM and Godfall!*  
>  
>　*ASTRO's PLAYROOM will come pre-installed on the PS5, making it easy to experience features unique to the PS5. The game also features ""haptic feedback"", which conveys the in-game experience through the controller through vibrations, as well as ""haptic feedback"", which makes button resistance more realistic in response to the game's context. PS5 features such as adaptive triggers can be enjoyed to the fullest.*  
>  
>*This might sound like a demo version, but this is a game that can be enjoyed as a normal game, with elements to enjoy the new features in an action game where you clear various stages. There's also a collection element, so I think you'll be able to get hooked on the game.*  
>  
>*Godfall"" is one of the titles that will be released at the same time as PS5, and it is an action RPG where you can experience exhilarating and powerful battles.*  
>  
>*Speaking of launch title action titles, there's also ""Demon's Souls"", but the action seems to be going in a different direction. It's an exhilarating experience, as you can move quickly, and cleave enemies that come at you with aplomb. This is an action title that can be recommended to a wide range of players, including those who think that ""deadly games are too difficult to play"" (......).*  
>  
>*My impressions of the PS5 after touching these games are ...... astonished at the strong impact they have on me!　I honestly didn't even get to the point where I could feel the exaggeration of something like ""I'm not sure if this is a good idea"" (laughs). And there probably aren't many people who can tell if a PS4 or PS5 game is a PS4 game or a PS5 game by the way it looks!*  
>  
>　*So you were disappointed?　...... No, no, I actually touched the controller and saw the PS5 itself up close and personal, and I felt a real sense of anticipation for its release, and it made me want to have a PS5! I felt a real sense of anticipation for the release of the PS5 and my greed for it was stimulated.*  
>  
>　*At first glance, it doesn't look that different from the PS4, does it? But after playing the game, we found that there is a big difference between the benefits of PS4 and PS5. ""There are some tactile sensations such as haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, but most importantly ""It's all about loading speed. You don't have to wait around unnecessarily while playing. I felt a great benefit from this, but it's not a bad thing.*  
>  
>*I think it's different when you're playing when you're restarting or switching between maps in a few seconds after a game over or when you switch maps, than when you're restarting or switching between stages that take about a minute to load.*  
>  
>　*Have you ever thought about not going back to the previous map for now because of the time it takes to switch between maps?*  
>  
>　*If you could fast-travel in an open-world game in a couple of seconds, wouldn't you want to actively explore every inch of the map?*  
>  
>　*Have you ever thought about taking quests in the northwest area in bulk because it takes more than 30 seconds to load every time you fast travel?*  
>  
>　*I think it's a great thing to not have to think about those ""unnecessary"" things when playing a game. I'm sure there are some people who use the length of the game to switch their minds and use the time in a positive way.*  
>  
>　*I'm sure there are a lot of titles that use loading times to display tips, but as a player, it's still better to not have them. In fact, the ""quality"" of the game experience will be very different if the game takes a long time to load and if it doesn't. In my opinion, this alone is enough to make it worth choosing the PS5 version over the PS4 version.*  
>  
>　*Aside from ""loading"", the other thing we experienced that made us go ""oh"" is ""adaptive triggers"". As announced so far, the load is applied to the game depending on the situation and the weight of the trigger to be pressed (or pulled) changes, but I think this is the feature that will surprise you the most when you touch PS5.*  
>  
>*The controller's ""vibration function"" itself is something we've experienced with previous PlayStation consoles, so the ""controller shaking"" wasn't a big surprise to us. As soon as the controller is shaken, you will notice that the quality of the vibrations is different from the previous ones. Several different vibrations, including fine and loud vibrations, are transmitted at the same time, like ...... ""thick but refreshing""? (Laughs) The minute but bold vibration feature makes you feel more immersed in the game!　""This is how I feel about experiencing haptic feedback in action.*  
>  
>　*That said, a lot of these features I've talked about above are title-dependent, so I'd like to wait for a title with plenty of these features to come out.*  
>  
>　*Unfortunately, we weren't able to experience 3D stereophonic sound due to the studio's environment and equipment, but we'll be sure to tell you about its appeal when we have another opportunity to do so.*  
>  
>*From here, I'd like to pick out some of the non-functional aspects of the PS5's features that I'm interested in.*  
>  
>*To tell you the truth, even more than the loading function, we were shocked at how quiet the fan was. I'm sure there are many people who have been wondering about this. It's so quiet!*  
>  
>　*The experience lasted about an hour and 45 minutes, and I think I spent about an hour and 20 minutes actually running PS5. It was a studio, so there wasn't a lot of stuff around, but with the lighting, the room temperature felt pretty hot. While playing ASTRO's PLAYROOM and Godfall, the sound of the fans (exhaust heat) didn't bother me at all. Rather, when I was about to finish my gameplay, I would hear a ""Huh?　Have you been turning fans? I even hurriedly confirmed it.*  
>  
>*The last time I touched the body, I didn't feel much heat and ...... seems to be no need to worry about the heat exhaustion structure.*  
>  
>　*I'm not going to be able to say that I'm not a fan of that, but I do feel that the body size is still very large. The thickness is also quite a bit, so I would like to secure a place with plenty of room to consider heat exhaustion for the installation location.*  
>  
>　*Speaking of the installation place, I noticed again when I took a picture of the PS5 main body that the disk slot should be on the bottom when the main body with a disk slot is placed horizontally.　The image of the device itself has already been officially released by the company, but when you see it in person, you're like, ""Ha!"" I was reminded of this.*  
>  
>*In addition, a stand will be included with the PS5 main unit. This stand is said to be used when the PS5 is placed horizontally. This information can be confirmed by the official images, but considering the shape of the console, it seems that it would be better to have a stand when the PS5 is placed horizontally to make it more stable.*  
>  
>*As for the controller, it is bigger and heavier than the PS4 due to the additional functions and increased battery capacity, but it is surprisingly light when you actually hold it!　Isn't it lighter than the PS4 controller?　It's surprisingly light in my opinion. It's actually bigger and heavier than it was .......*  
>  
>　*This time the controller has a lot of new features, but the inclusion of a microphone is very useful!　The windmill turning gimmick in ASTRO's PLAYROOM involves turning the windmill in response to the controller's microphone. The gimmick was responsive to the gimmick even when I had it on my desk, which will come in handy during actual chat use.*  
>  
>*It can also produce sound just like the PS4 controller, but it also produces rather high-pitched sounds, and I felt that the range of sounds it can express has expanded since the PS4.*  
>  
>　*Unfortunately, we weren't able to check out the PS5's home screen or share play via the create button, or other features that haven't yet been revealed, but the experience of playing a game on the PS5 made us realize that the PS5's arrival is finally just around the corner.*  
>  
>　*The PS5 is only about a month away, and we'll be sure to bring you more information as we get closer to its release.""*",198,1601813058.0,/r/PS5/comments/j4w9va/dengeki_online_no_noticeable_fan_noise_on_ps5_at/

It needs to stop. The actors of tlou2 would get death threats towards their family. What type of fucking joke is that? I'm so sick of it, why the fuck do these people think that sending hate messages over a game is ok? Is it any wonder why news and media outlets hate the gaming industry.

The devs at insomniac have already stated they spent a year, pouring work into this new face model, its not just some deep fake skin they've tacked on. Its taken development time, they had to do it to future-proof their sequels. They've shown you this change, well before release, if you dont like the product they have created, then don't buy it.

itetp1,SotaSkoldier,"As someone who deals with productions all day every day let me just put some additional information out there.  Because what they said is pretty deliberate corporate speak.  First and foremost.  This production thing is NOTHING for people to freak out about.

They addressed the lowering of productions being false.  They did not address whether they are meeting productions they've set though which is what is going to impact them the most.

I work in the solar industry doing utility scale solar installations.  I can set a production.  I can say  that I want to have my crews install 10MW/week of solar panels.  If they run into any issues they are likely not hitting 10 MW/week.  Say they have a shipment of panels that are broken or the wiring is bad or what have you.  It could be a million things.  Production being set does not mean production being met.  All that happens is if I had 10 weeks to build 100MW and I am now doing 9.1MW/week I will now work for 11 week.  The same end result.

In the case of Sony they could have set a production number and are sticking to it, but the actual production does not meet what they set it at.  So lets speculate that the yield issue is on some level true.  Lets say they wanted to make 500,000 consoles per week.  In the beginning they knew there would be some yield issues.  There *always* is with new technology.  They planned for 500,000/week assuming they would have yield issues on 30% of their chips.  IT, BIIIIG IF, the 50% yield number is accurate then it is entirely possible they still have the exact same production numbers, but their manufacturing is not meeting that production due to yield issues.

Also, this is not something to panic over.  Not meeting production happens all the time, in every industry from manufacturing to marketing.  It is business.

This would be a very aggressive take by Sony. Someone who is determined to buy a Playstation console would eat up the 50 bucks difference. With 399/499 we have a broad option of consoles to pick for:

Still didn't make the jump to 4K, just casually gaming, don't care about Playstation brand/games? -> Series S

More serious gaming at 4K, but don't care about Playstation brand/games? -> Series X

Serious gaming at 4K, cares about Playstation exclusives but only plays digitally? -> PS5 DE

Same as above but want a disk drive? -> PS5 Standard edition

Nothing would change if Sony would price their consoles 50 bucks lower, but thats just my opinion; I wouldn't mind sparing 50 bucks though :P",58,1600197650.0,/r/PS5/comments/itetp1/sony_we_have_not_changed_the_production_number/

I get the PS5 thing, because you want maximum controller compatibility moving forward. Even Wii U had to assume you had a regular Wiimote and note a Wii Remote Plus or whatever because they couldn't even bundle one with the system.

That said, there will certainly be a ton of games that don't utilize the new features of the Dual Sense.  Like lets say Overcooked 3 came out, a game that uses a minimum a d-pad and 2 action buttons... why would I need to buy 3 new Dual Sense controllers at probably $180 to enjoy some 4 player action?

hwkeu1,Khronify,"I feel like the problem is that Microsoft has abandoned the console selling strategy and has fully embraced the netflix style gamepass strategy. This showcase to me was focused more on promoting gamepass rather than the Series X.

Because of this, it’s a waste for MS first-party developers to fully optimize a game that’s going to be on multiple platforms anyway, of course being cross-gen doesn’t help either. This is why all those posts and articles comparing the specs between the Series X and Ps5 and the marketing  “World’s Most Powerful Console” are useless.

Sony on the other hand continues to reiterate their belief in high budget single-player games, which is better in the end because their exclusives will take full advantage of the new hardware. I still find it unbelievable how good TLOU2 looks and runs better than most games out there today on 2013 hardware. 

Of course we all have preferences, if you don’t enjoy third person single player games then the ps5 is probably not for you, but then if you prefer multiplayer you’re better off getting a pc since every xbox game is heading there anyway. 

I really see no point in getting a Series X since it seems like Microsoft themselves aren’t too keen on promoting it and instead are diverting all their efforts to the gamepass. 

Now this is definitely not a bad thing, from a business and consumer standpoint it’s an amazing deal. However I don’t feel like the cost that comes with it of not being able to fully optimize a game for next gen is worth it though.



EDIT: I’ve seen some people pointing out that the Series X is a much more affordable alternative to a gaming PC, to which I completely agree with. 

There is no doubt that it will appeal to more casual gamers and sell well, regardless if it’s games are going to pc as well.

Keep in mind this entire post is just my opinion on the matter, as I don’t have any facts to back up what Microsoft’s business strategy is.

In the end though, in my opinion I just feel like a gaming pc is a much better investment, besides being double the cost since you could do more on it and play xbox games with better specs, granted if they optimize the games for that.

hwkeu1,iWentRogue,"Let me start by saying that i think Naughty Dog are absolute beasts when it comes to pushing the boundaries of graphics and gameplay. 

**But**

This is a bad comparison. TLOU2 and Halo are going for two completely different art styles. 

**TLOU2** is going for a realistic style, not only graphically but gameplay wise as well. Those who have played the game know what i’m reffering to. Being shot makes you flinch or fall, Ellie takes deep breathes and pants, your gun sways if you’re trying to shoot and move, storage is limited for resources; all the above are an attempt to mimick what they believe would be realistic behavior. 

**Halo** in the other hand is not trying to be this hyper realistic game and neither are they going for a realistic graphic display. They have a softer artstyle to compliment the gameplay and colors of everything Halo has to offer (space terrains/environments/ different species etc.) Halo is an FPS that is not trying to be realistic; you can carry an abundance of ammo, you get shot and you don’t flinch drastically, you’re alway coming across these big shootout sections and the narrative is that syfy genre about space and aliens. 

These two games are just not on the same plane as far artistic style and although Halo has some things the developers try to make realistic, the bottom line is that is not on the same realistic pathway that TLOU2 was.",189,1595531749.0,/r/PS5/comments/hwkeu1/heres_why_sony_developers_deserve_more_praise/

Sony just seems more in touch with what their consumers want. They also understand that it is their exklusive games that sell their consoles to many people who would otherwise not buy a console. They understand the importance of good marketing. They continue to focus on what made the PS4 such a success.

Microsoft still doesn’t seem to get it. Yes they are going into a different direction than Sony; trying to merge PC gaming and Xbox together in their Microsoft environment. I am very happy to seem them working on X-Cloud and the game pass is a great thing for consumers. But Microsoft still hasn’t learned that people want games. Gaming is about games.

Sony wants to sell as many of the digital edition as possible, since it forces _all_ games to be sold through the PlayStation store which gives Sony way more money per sale, and prevents 2nd hand circulation.

The customer therefore will be hesitant for these same reasons. The digital version not only won't be able to serve as a Blu-ray player, but will also force you to buy games digitally which is usually more expensive, plus you can't sell them later to make some money back.

I'd expect a $100 difference, or maybe the digital one having double the storage at the same price. It would be a great move from Sony for all parties involved (except physical game stores lol).",74,1592227194.0,/r/PS5/comments/h9dxlq/ps5_hardware_reveal_trailer_is_now_playstations/

There are plenty of shortcuts and lack of precision moments in this, as it was a result of my discussion with some Bros on discord. In short, some add onn:  
\- Everything is liquid if the temperature is appropriate. Gallium is liquid at 30C/85F  
\- Metal does not evaporate, but solvent and additives from TIM mix compound can (depends on the compound, modern are rather resilient).  
\- PC users don't have to change the LM often, usually, it's done as a precaution or just while upgrading/cleaning the system. It is however rule of thumb that it's good to check in 2-3 years.   
\- Degradation can occur as the interaction between the metals, i.e. galvanic corrosion between copper and aluminum in custom loops (SONY developed the compound and the heatsink, I'm sure they have taken this into consideration and made adjustments).   
\- Seal does not have to be vacuum tight, its enough if it can withstand the top pressure that builds during max heat up. It also prevents any condensation inside the compartment (unless you put your PS5 into the freezer). There is another layer of seal around, marked blue.   
\- Xbox GPU is bigger (52 vs 36 and clocked lower, thus can operate on lower voltage and has a bigger dissipation surface (less thermal density). It does not scale proportionally.  
\- This is the most interesting generation ever.  
\- there is a seal around SOC, its visible on the patent. It protects all electric sensitive parts. Please note that on the video presentation TWO MOTHERBOARDS were shown. One is with attachment on my screenshot, second was used to show the die and other components.  
\- I should make a Fig 215/225 (check the patent pic) mark on the picture, which is all visible part underneath of foam around the die. It is not a shiny, metal part shown when chip was presented on the video.

As many of you I was surprised of Sonys approach to cooling. We all were expecting a beefy cooler after PS4 ""jet engine"" fail, but to anyone who's into PC building, overclocking, etc. it's obvious that they did a total overkill and a really state of the art job.

&#x200B;

Voices and concerns are risen as for ""LM is it ok in vertical, i heard is degrading, who uses it on pc changes LM periodically"" etc.

Well, vertical/horizontal doesn't matter. I'm not getting into detail with that.

&#x200B;

What does matter is over time degradation, also corrosion, and thermal expanding of the material.

1st there's no such thing as LM, there is but quite toxic (mercury). So all LM compounds are enriched mixes of different stuff with gallium. During the time it evaporates and oxidizes, sometimes causing the reaction with the cooling block surface (google it, plenty of pics ""my water block after 2 y of LM"").

&#x200B;

Sony tackled the issue by sealing the die and the compound hermetically under the radiator. We've seen this on their patent, but couldn't interpret it earlier.

You can see on the pic that there's a seal around SOC chip with a tiny gap around.

Gap is for the thermal expansion of LM. If it was sealed flat, there would be constant pressure build-ups during heating up which might have lead to die degradation.

It's clearly visible on the patent, that this tiny gap creates a compartment around the SOC, and all conductive elements are sealed under and around it.

&#x200B;

Providing the CPU has around 40W TDP and GPU can be estimated up to 140W, this is a really nice solution. I think that PS5 has to run cool, not for the sake of being quiet, but for the necessity of high clocks speed. OC 1.0.1 - to increase the clock you either push more voltage or lower the temps, usually both until you hit the wall.

Sony had to keep the temps low, to be able to hit 2.23 GHz without pushing more voltage. And it's very much connected to the SOC architecture approach they took (vide Mark's explanation on Road to PS5 presentation). The variable clock rates and the AMD smart shift are limiting clocks to a fixed power budget, but when you keep the temps at bay, the same power budget allows you to crank the clocks higher.

&#x200B;

Xbox constructors went to a different way (traditional) of solving power issues - IMHO they went to the brute force way, clocked the GPU significantly lower and build power balance around the fixed/max operating temperature not a constant one. They didn't have to worry about cooling the components that much, and Xbox will be far more resilient to temperature, thus doesn't need as beefy cooler. It will run hotter, but it's not a flaw. ZEN2 cores can run 70 degrees all day long, VRM and DDR6 can run on 100+ and still be in spec. Some RDNA1 cards are running 90 degress.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Sony did a great job, the console will be cool and quiet and we won't have to change LM over time as PC users do.",3303,1602155844.0,/r/PS5/comments/j7b732/sony_liquid_metal_degradation_solution/

The problem with liquid metal cooling is mechanical retention and potential for interactivity with the heatsink material. Casually slapping it on an aluminium alloy heatsink as found in a PS4 or many PC coolers is a recipe for gallium flowing into and breaking up the heatsink.

In all likelihood, most next gen games will also be $70 like 2K announced so no issue there outside of the relatively weak argument that they shouldn’t release a game every year.

And I don’t really get the complaints about profiting off of Kobe’s death. They release the “Legend” version for $100 every year, people were literally begging for them to put Kobe on it this year, and if anything, it’s a better deal this year than past years.

>With each generation, from the first PlayStation to PlayStation 4, we aim higher and we push the boundaries further, to try and deliver better experiences for our community. This has been the mission of the PlayStation brand for more than 25 years. A mission I have been a part of nearly since the beginning.    
>  
>There are few things as exciting as the launch of a new console. While this road to launch has been a bit…different, we are as thrilled as ever to bring you with us on this journey to redefine the future of videogames.  
>  
>We’ve shared technical specifications and shown you the new DualSense wireless controller. But what is a launch without games?   
>  
>That’s why I’m excited to share that we will soon give you a first look at the games you’ll be playing after PlayStation 5 launches this holiday. The games coming to PS5 represent the best in the industry from innovative studios that span the globe. Studios, both larger and smaller, those newer and those more established, all have been hard at work developing games that will showcase the potential of the hardware.   
>  
>This digital showcase will run for a bit more than an hour and, for the first time, we will all be together virtually experiencing the excitement together. A lack of physical events has given us an amazing opportunity to think differently and bring you on this journey with us, and hopefully, closer than ever before. This is part of our series of PS5 updates and, rest assured, after next week’s showcase, we will still have much to share with you.

gsuk7t,vgjdotgg,"Hey everyone, hope you're having a great day!

**Highlights:**

* Sony is excited to share that we will soon give you a first look at the games you’ll be playing after PlayStation 5 launches this holiday.
* The games coming to PS5 represent the best in the industry from innovative studios that span the globe.
* Studios, both larger and smaller, those newer and those more established, all have been hard at work developing games that will showcase the potential of the hardware. 
* ***This digital showcase will run for a bit more than an hour.***
* ""This is part of our series of PS5 updates and, rest assured, after next week’s showcase, we will still have much to share with you.""

**More from** [**GamesIndustry.biz**](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-05-29-playstation-5-games-to-be-revealed-on-june-4th)**:**

* **Jim Ryan:** ""I'm expecting Thursday's PlayStation 5 event to be a strong showing for Sony.""
* ""It will focus on areas where Sony is traditionally strong: product design, with what I assume will be the full reveal of the PS5, and its games development expertise.""
* ""I'm expecting a more competitive line up of first-party content between Sony and Microsoft next-gen, so the next few weeks and months of reveals should have a lot to offer the console gamer and give us a better idea of how the platforms will perform in the market.""
* ""One key aspect I'll be looking out for is confirmed exclusives for PS5. With Microsoft following a different commercial path, Sony's strategy to embrace exclusives for its next-gen console is a key differentiator. Concerning the hardware, I wouldn't be surprised if there was no pricing announcement, although we commonly get pricing at around this time, normally at E3, before a launch at the end of the year. The COVID-19 crisis and the economic situation means that choosing when to confirm the pricing is more of a challenge, and, in the current climate, it probably makes sense to wait longer before the reveal.""

**Breakdown:**

**On challenges in current climate and commitment to global launch this year**

""But we are obviously principally occupied with getting ready for PS5. I think most businesses would find themselves challenged with the working-from-home environment, and I do think the way that the various groups within PlayStation have responded has been magnificent. There are the hardware engineers who are having to work without being able to get into China, where PS5 will be assembled. That's kind of tough. The software engineers who are building these great features, who are building a great PS5 UI... some of that can be readily done in isolation. But when it comes to putting it all together, that's not easy to do remotely and they're doing a great job.

And finally, the people who make games. We, and our partners, seem to be coping really well. And so we are on track. We are going to launch this holiday and we're going to launch globally. We're really looking forward to it and it's going to be a blast.""

**On pricing and value**

""Recent history has told us that gaming is one of the pastimes and one of the businesses, that benefits in economically difficult times,"" Ryan suggests. ""It's quite logical, people don't have the money to go out so they stay at home. Now, who knows how this recession is going to look, how deep it will be and how long it will last. It could be that the historic templates, the historic models, that have applied in the past may not apply in the future.""

""I think the best way that we can address this is by providing the best possible value proposition that we can. I don't necessarily mean the lowest price. Value is a combination of many things. In our area it means games, it means a number of games, depth of games, breadth of games, quality of games, price of games... all of these things and how they avail themselves of the feature set of the platform.""

**On Generational Philosophy**

One way to keep PS4 users engaged would be to make upcoming PS5 games playable on the older machine, just like Microsoft is proposing with its Xbox Series X games being playable on Xbox One. Yet Ryan says that's not something PlayStation is interested in doing.

""We have always said that we believe in generations. We believe that when you go to all the trouble of creating a next-gen console, it should include features and benefits that the previous generation does not include. And that, in our view, people should make games that can make the most of those features.

""We do believe in generations, and whether it's the DualSense controller, whether it's the 3D audio, whether it's the multiple ways that the SSD can be used... we are thinking that it is time to give the PlayStation community something new, something different, that can really only be enjoyed on PS5.""

**On Marketing The PS5**

""That's the challenge I've set the teams: try to get that community, the 100 million people -- and all of the people who don't have a PlayStation we'd like to talk to -- just as excited as if they were in the E3 auditorium, or if they were watching the stream.""

Great example: I originally played InFamous Festival of Blood the same month Second Son came out. Didn't have a PS4 at the time but still wanted more InFamous after playing finishing FoB so I went and watched some gameplay. Was immediately obvious within seconds how much a leap forward the PS4 was over the PS3, completely blew me away.

I just assume when people talk about how a new generation isn't that impressive they've completely forgot how older games look.

hedlho,itshonestwork,"PS4 was exciting to me because of how awful Xbox One looked to be, and because of the strength and momentum PS3 had late on.  

PS5 is exciting to me because of the new kind of games and game ideas it can unlock, and because the apparent ease of development for it promises even more higher quality games. Plus the commitment to PS VR, the custom and powerful dedicated audio hardware, and the haptics and adaptive triggers.  
And the games shown so far.  

It all feels very focussed on itself compared to last generation where it seemed more contrasted to its rival.

Edit: The PS3 bluray speed was 72Mb/s, which is 9MB/s and the Xbox 360 was 15MB/s. So the PS4 loading speed was approx 10x faster than the PS3's bluray

GT Sport wasn't a proper GT game and turned away alot of hardcore fans. I never cared to play it, online only racing is boring and is only half the experience of the GT games. 

GT5 was awesome, it had the circuit racing, rally racing, and even drag racing. There were a good mix of the race cars, GT cars, rally cars, economy cars, JDM and muscle cars. It's was literally like Pornhub for cars. The extra features like the license and Nurburgring trails were amazing and each car had its own description lol.

DS4 is unbeaten for wireless controllers at 2.8ms lag.

i9r9vi,Ablj,"To be honest I can’t blame Xbox fans, Xbox marketing is all wrong. Xbox is not targeting the casuals. Playstation is by setting up deals with Rockstar Games making GTA Online free, exclusive content for Call of Duty and Fortnite. Sony investing in Epic Games probably means more exclusives. Promoting NBA 2k in the reveal event is another example.

The console design is as generic as it gets. Xbox naming is all wrong. If you go out in public and ask strangers about Seires X they would probably have no idea but if you ask about PS5 then they would probably tell you it is the next gen Playstation.

Xbox’s first ‘gameplay’ event felt like it was produced by Youtubers where Playstation reveal event was professional and the productional quality was much higher. The console reveal transition was top notch.",67,1597434554.0,/r/PS5/comments/i9r9vi/the_guy_who_started_all_these_rumors_and_articles/

gkwgpb,EpsilonNu,"Everybody's opinion on this is that we are fucking tired of this argument AND the opposite one. Every goddamnd second there's a post about how 8K@12fps is the shit and the next there's a ""who agrees that it would be nice to play at 240fps even if it meant going back to 720p?"".

The people that answer to these posts are the absolute smallest minority, because the overwelming majority of people understands at least some of these facts:

1) **30fps is fine**. I'm not saying ""they are great"", nor ""they are perfect"", nor ""you can't see more than 30fps"", nor ""60 or more frames per second are useless"", nor ""I don't want more fps"". I'm saying they are *fine*. Literally 100% of the entire fucking world in the entire history of humanity watches movies at 24fps, and anime at 12. The only exception are those two people that like The Hobbit movies, and that's still 48fps against your beloved 60, apparently the least  a free human should tolerate before rioting in the streets. NOBODY ever said a movie feels unwatchable because of framerate. Yes, games also have to take into account input lag and the fact that you control the action, but unless your controller is connected to your console with five meters of copper wire found in the streets, even that is not enough to make 30fps outright *bad*. The only exception to this are action focused games (racing games, sports games, e-sports, competitive games...), and they ALL run at 60fps by design even on consoles.

2) **graphics sell, and it's good**. I'm not saying ""graphics are all that matter"", nor ""you too should take graphics over framerate any day"". I'm saying it's good, and just that. No offense, but you feel a generational leap when the game that made you think ""yeah, nothing will ever look better"" gets eclipsed by any decent game on a new system, not when you lower your settings to the minimum so you can play a 10 years old game twice as fast (don't start with examples of recent and good looking games that you are able to run at 4K@90fps ultra settings: that hardware is expensive and EXTREMELY rare. Many gamers don't even play at 1080p. You having two 2080Ti doesn't change this).

3) **having a limited choice in resolution and framerate is what makes consoles' perfomance-to-price ratio possible**. I'm not saying ""I want to be stripped of my freedom"", nor ""I don't want to chose and so should you"". It's just like this: the reasons console exclusives on 200-500$ hardware look and run as good as on 800-1000$ PCs are closed hardware and limited resolutions/framerates. Console developers don't have to consider the fact that someone may want to play at 420p@240fps or at 16K@PowerpointPresentationFPS. They can have a single target and squeeze as much performance as they can to reach it. Yes, midgen consoles *SOMETIMES* gave us a choice, but those choices were mostly ""the main one"" and ""the one that lowers something and unlocks something else, but never reaching good results"". If the main setting was high resolution, lowering it to unlock the framerate barely gives you 15 more, basically never you go to stable 60. Given how powerful next gen consoles are and how much 1080p TVs are still used, it's possible more games will offer two choices. But don't cry if this doesn't happen: it means the developers didn't want to bother changing their plans for some whiny kids that think they have the reaction time of Flash.

4) **consoles target a specific audience**. I'm not saying ""get over it or don't play on console"", nor ""get fucked you are not in the majority ahaha!"". Maybe you really can see the fabric of spacetime and get nauseous looking at anything slower than light itself, maybe you played with your counsin's 3000$ worth of PC and can't go back anymore even if you genuinely try. But consoles want a compromise between performance and graphics to attract the largest possible number of people, and unfortunately for you those people's definition of performance is ""the minimum possible framerate and the best possible graphics"". For anything else PC is an obligated choice. 

If you really think about it, it's not even about framerate: consoles also don't usually target the highest possible resolution. Sure, the Pro is sold as a 4K machine, but not even the more powerful OneX plays at native 4K anything but the least good-looking games. And now even PS5 and Series X might stay at upscaled 1440p if it's necessary to push more complex worlds. So PC is not only the place to have 60fps, but also true 4K, and it has been so for years. It's just that you notice the fps problem because of how much the Mustard Reis told you that every frame lost is a dead child somewhere in Africa. You could write ""I'm a pixel lover and I'm tired of upscaled resolutions, when will Sony give us true 8K? My eyes bleed if I can distinguish two dots on a screen!"", and it would be as true and as logical as the fps argument (so, not true and not logical).",205,1589649280.0,/r/PS5/comments/gkwgpb/i_dont_really_care_about_4k_i_just_want_all_the/

gkwgpb,lukevp,"24 fps for film isn't a fair comparison to 30 fps for gaming.  A camera's shutter is letting in light over a period of time, so there is inherent motion blur that makes the lower fps capture more intrinsic motion data.  game frames are snapshots in time and don't have this, even if there is a ""motion blur"" pixel shader enabled.

There are also a lot of rules around panning speed and such in 24 fps that keep smearing to a minimum, which aren't applied in games.  That's why action movies have a lot of jump cuts, because they can't have fast motion and pans without visible choppiness.

1. The price is around 600$ and both Microsoft & Sony are figuring out how to market that.

3. They are figuring out logistics of how to launch without traditional holiday shopping experiences.

I don't buy the idea that it's a game of chicken where one side will undercut the other. They've been designing these consoles for years, and have had their strategies mapped out for just as long. You don't design a major product like this, with very specific technologies, millions in marketing research and campaigns, only to base your entire launch window strategy on a 50$ difference with Microsoft.

I know a lot of people with £500-£600 waiting for them to announce price just in case, rather over budget than under budget right? And at this rate, they're going to get away with charging £600 for it.

We should stop talking about us being able to afford a console for £600. On that note. Sony, I only have £20, a packet of wine gums and half a mars bar. Best offer I got. Make it happen.

Edit : So it wasn't clear that what I was saying was mostly in jest. I think the influence we have on price is negligible. But it is also naive to suggest that we are completely ignored.

j0k1a8,Semifreak,"I read the specs. I hear the specs. But it is something else when I see it in action. The only 3 times I saw this are in the very early Spiderman tech demo (was that leaked or intentionally released by Sony?), Ratchet and Clank and Demon's Souls. The most obvious test was seeing the DS loading during the game demo. There are videos and gifs comparing the same thing with the old game and the new game took less than a second to load! 

As for specific time announcements, both Ken and NBA2K devs said loading times are 2 seconds- even from boot up. That's just crazy. No more wondering around a circle like a lost idiot in GoW in that fancy loading circle area between worlds. 

There is another feature that they haven't shown yet; 'quick jump'. It's when you immediately jump to a specific part of the game from the system UI instead of going through the linear process of today. So you can immediately jump to the SP or MP part. You can join a friend's MP session or load your last save all instantly from the PS5 UI. 

Xbox has a very cool feature which is 'multiple fast resumes' where you have have a number of games in suspension and continue where you left off in each one. The have a video of it and it looks insane. PS5 is much faster but I don't know if it can suspend multiple games. PS5 loads much faster than Xbox, but some games don't quick save you like the resume function we have in today's consoles (like in mid race). 

I have no doubt there is no going back after this. I want a fast I/O on PC as well and now Nvidia announced something similar. hopefully this will be standardised on PC in the near future because once next gen releases, everyone will start noticing the loading on PC. An SSD alone isn't enough; you have to have a supporting I/O on a system level to get those insane speed.

j0k1a8,footyDude,"> what would be the point of multiple suspended games? 


A suspended game can take you back to exactly where you were when you left - half way through a corner in GT; 78 minutes into that game in Fifa or whatever. 


By comparison if the game isn't suspended and instead are just closed but reopen with a few seconds (i.e. same timespan) the downside is that it won't return you to the exact same point (at least not in games that don't have continuous auto-save/allow saving at any point in time).


Multi-game suspend/resume would, I think, be a little better.


Either way the promised massively reduced load times is my most anticipated feature this upcoming gen...as someone married, with kids I tend to get short little bursts of time to play, often <30 mins. I love RDR2 but honestly the load-times put me off unless i know i've got a bigger session available (and suspend/resume would help here if my son didn't love Minecraft so much that whatever I suspended is never there by the time i'm back to my session!).",132,1601195637.0,/r/PS5/comments/j0k1a8/ps5_just_went_super_saiyan_1738_gbs_is_mind/

iagq85,Clarkey7163,"Just so people are aware, this isn't because of Microsoft or w/e pushing for cross-gen support, its just natural business and most third party devs will have similar problems.

Game Dev is a balance of creative and business motives, I'm sure many developers are ecstatic about the new hardware and want to really support it, but the install base of PS4 and XB1 is so great that it doesn't make business sense to cut ties just yet. 

So devs have to try and push out games that stretch across the two, making their games as good as possible on the current gen consoles and then making them as pretty as possible on the next gen consoles in order to sell them and look good (no one wants to put out a sub-par looking game on next-gen, because you'll launch next to games like Spider-Man Miles Morales which will look awesome). 

So yeah, cross-gen is a gift and a curse, sacrifice creative vision for business sense. In a few years, when the next-gen systems have a larger install base we'll cut ties with PS4/XB1 and games will truly start to take advantage of next-gen. In the mean time, rely on Sony first party (which have the luxury of not needing to worry too much about sales) to push the boundaries",88,1597545547.0,/r/PS5/comments/iagq85/developers_reportedly_find_crossgen_games_painful/
iagq85,ZXE102Rv2,"Not surprising really. You have amazing technology at your disposal, solid state drives, better GPU, better everything, while being forced to make games work on the old technology as well. 

Cross gen games now more than any other generation hold back gaming design the most considering how big this generational leap is.

Edit : funny how all the pc gamers came out to say ""now you know how pc gamers feel""
Look up my reddit name minus the ""v2"". ""ZXE102R"" is on steam. Yeah. I was a very active pc gamer. Not as active now though. But yeah. PC gaming gets the shaft because of this very reason as well. The more configurations you have to optimize for, the more man hours you put in, and the harder it is to develop. Sure, you can say pc gaming gets held back by consoles, but there's other reasons PCs get held back. Drivers, drivers, and more drivers. It's so much harder to get pc games to work. Whereas consoles don't have much of the complicated inner workings that PCs have.

PC gaming also gets held back even more because of the hundreds of different configurations that a normal pc user can possibly have, from 10 year old Hard drives to the fastest SSDs money can buy. From low end GeForce MX250 to high end RTX graphics cards. 

PCs - parts all jumbled together that don't work in sync with each other. 

Consoles - a cheaper system that's made from the ground up with everything inside working in sync.

The huge amount of configurations themselves is what holds pc gaming back, not consoles. You want pc gaming to flourish? Tell your pc community to all buy one configuration lol. Oh wait. It's not that easy.

In the end, nothing is ever easy. But what makes things easier, is when devs have less configurations to worry about. Less configurations gives them more time to optimize the remaining configurations. If every pc purchased by a gamer was the same exact graphics card, ssd, operating system, etc, then pc gaming would flourish. But unfortunately it is not. So pc gaming will forever be held back because it's not standardized. Meanwhile, consoles, while the weaker of the 2, are stronger overall because consoles are standardized.",2224,1597530395.0,/r/PS5/comments/iagq85/developers_reportedly_find_crossgen_games_painful/

Sony's moves (pushing forth the new hardware) might seem ""anti-consumer"" in general, but if you buy into the PS5, you're getting more for your dollar basically, their goals are to support their system first and foremost, its a bit of an Apple style approach I guess. 

If you buy a PS5, it comes with Sony's full support behind it, they're going to shift all their studios towards making games exclusively for that hardware and you're going to get the best games on that hardware possible out of it. Whereas on the Series X side, you'll have the benefit of getting Game Pass and a lot of pretty good games relatively cheaply, but none of them will be _designed_ for your system. ""Designed"" here being the key word that many people misinterpret when it comes to cross-gen games.

The Last of Us: Remastered is a game designed for PS3,  and visually optimized for PS4. The Last of Us 2 is a game designed **and** visually optimised for PS4, both games run at 1080p/30fps on the base PS4, but TLOU2 is fundamentally better than TLOU1 (technically, narrative-wise it may vary). The claims that Phil Spencer made that first party games won't be affected by cross-gen is patently false and anyone with even an entry level experience with development of any kind knows that. 

I will say this, when MS drops the dumb cross-gen stuff and their studios are working on XSX games only (with SSDs in the minimum spec since they'll still support PCs) , that Series X console has the potential to make some shit that will genuinely blow the games we have now out of the water. I'm excited for that as a multi-platform user but it won't be coming for another 2-4 years :\",81,1597545964.0,/r/PS5/comments/iagq85/developers_reportedly_find_crossgen_games_painful/

You can buy the PS5 and play all of the great PS4 games while you wait for the PS5 to get a nice library of its own.

Everyone else has probably already mentioned all of these games, but I recently commented with my top ten on another post, so I'll just copy and paste that here for recommendations. I'll give a blurb about why I like each one as well.

&#x200B;

1. Bloodborne(Edge of your seat combat, gorgeous dark art style, subtly told, confusing, but intriguing story. Best played in co-op in my opinion)
2. Ghost of Tsushima(Haven't beaten it yet, but I am absolutely enamored with it. Combat makes you feel like a samurai and the world is the most beautiful that I've ever seen.)
3. TLOU2(Dark, atmospheric, and visceral. The story will tear you apart and push you to your emotional limits. Obviously play the first game first.)
4. God of War(Strong and brutal combat in a beautiful world that all really stands out if you play the previous games, and a beautiful father and son tale to boot.)
5. Spiderman(Remarkably good interpretation of New York and just an incredible hero game. Great renditions of all of the Spiderman characters and absolutely awesome web swinging.)
6. Horizon(Just feels original as fuck. Fighting robot dinosaurs in a prehistoric distant future, like, fuck man, just awesome.)
7. Death Stranding(An absolutely gorgeous dead world. Gives you these vibes of isolation and desperation as you traverse this harsh and empty world. It's a convoluted and slow story, but an great ride.)
8. Uncharted Lost Legacy(Third person action and platforming at its finest. Play the other games first)
9. Uncharted 4(Ctrl+C Ctrl+V, Third person action and platforming at its finest. Play the other games first)
10. Infamous Second Son(A great initial instance of the next gen power of the PS4 at the time. Fun open world action game with awesome powers and a great rendition of the beautiful PNW gem, Seattle.)",87,1595630528.0,/r/PS5/comments/hx7xhp/after_17_years_with_xbox_ive_decided_to_make_the/

If you have young kids then Nintendo is by far the best option as far family content goes. Virtually all their first party titles are appropriate for younger audiences but also enjoyable for adults as well. They also are one of the few companies who support local co-op and splitscreen on a majority of their titles so you can get one device for the whole family to play on together. I have had so much fun playing through Luigi’s Mansion and Mario Odyssey in co-op mode with my 5 year old daughter. There’s nothing like that on competing systems. 

Nintendo also crushes it when it comes to adult party games. If you’re hosting people often then you can actually play games together in your living room. Super Smash Bros, Mario Party, Mario Kart, Mario Tennis - I have had so much fun playing these games at parties with my friends. 

Obviously there’s also the mobility factor of the Switch. As someone who travels a lot it’s nice to be able to play games on the go. 

Sony on the other hand comes in and crushes it with mostly adult oriented single player story games. If you want narrative driven experiences then this is the place for you. Uncharted, The Last of Us, etc are the gold standard for these types of games. PS4 is also the best platform if you’re interested in fighting games with almost every tournament being hosted on the platform, all the pros using the platform, and the biggest number of releases in the genre including some crazy console exclusives like Street Fighter V, Guilty Gear Rev 2, and KOF XIV.

Microsoft imo has the best overall console for playing third party AAA games, and the best value for your money. Every first party game goes on GamePass day 1, and they are constantly getting new AAA games on the service as well. There are so many times where I paid $60 for a game only for it to go on GamePass the next day. If you’re a parent of teenagers especially theres no better deal for you. Growing up I remember waiting months and months to get a new game since my mom couldn’t afford to get me any aside from Christmas and my birthday usually. $10 a month though? She totally could’ve done that, and I would’ve had hundreds of games to play each year. The potential is mind blowing. 

They also have a ton of great features for those of us who mostly play on PC but also have a console in the living room. GamePass Ultimate is only $15 a month and gives you games on both PC and Xbox, all first party games are going to GamePass PC day one, any time you buy a first party title on Xbox you get it on PC and vice versa, you can chat with your Xbox friends while on PC, etc. 

As it stands, I primarily use my One X for most third party AAA games. I play fighting games and Sony first party games on my PS4. I play games with my daughter on the Switch, as well as use it for entertainment with guests, and game with it on the road. Aside from Nintendo titles I usually play all retro themed indie games on the Switch because it just feels like a retro system to me and the 16bit graphics style looks great in handheld. 

If I could only buy one single platform then I would probably roll with Playstation if I was a single adult because they get all the third party games since the install base is huge plus they have the best library of story driven first party titles. But with kids then it gets trickier because like I said Nintendo clearly has the family content on lockdown as well as local multiplayer, and for older kids I would save the most money with Xbox GamePass.",56,1595643364.0,/r/PS5/comments/hx7xhp/after_17_years_with_xbox_ive_decided_to_make_the/

BUT I feel the story in 3 was much better. The backstory added for Drake and the deepening of relationships. The ensemble cast and the interesting villain.
Though they fumbled the ending in my opinion and the boss fight was just an over used mechanic.

UC3 also had two of my favourite set pieces. The ship and the horse ride were amazing.
