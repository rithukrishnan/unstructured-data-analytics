And for those who seek power they have the Series X and can actually promote it with world‘s strongest console as their specs are better than PS5.

I wonder what Sony is going to do. They will most likely price the PS5 DE at 399€ and the disc version at 499€. But will the DE sell that well for people who might fit in the Series S group?

It also seems there's going to be an expansion that's even bigger than the core game itself and, while CDPR won't *pay* you for downloading it, I can confirm it is completely free, and it comes with 5 download codes of The Witcher 3 GOTY Edition so you can continue to spread the good word of Geraldo.

Between the massive failures like *No Man's Sky*, *Destiny 2*, and *Overwatch*, I felt like everything I loved about gaming had evaporated, and I was left with a desperate longing for an experience that would breathe new life into me and give me the courage to go on just one more day.

Then *Cyberpunk* came along.

This is the greatest game I have ever played. Every single element of this game has been carefully constructed towards perfection. The graphics are unbelievable, the music is phenomenal, the story could rival the greatest masterpieces ever written all the way back to the debut of *Gilgamesh*, and the gameplay...well, let me just say that the Witcher 3 has finally been dethroned as the game that every person totally and obviously recognizes was the GOAT. Nothing can compete with taking down corporate goons with top-level hacks, summoning a lightning bolt to level a skyscraper, and wearing a clever David Hasselhoff mask to pass by security checks. And who can forget the emotional denouement when you finally discover who your real uncle is on your deathbed?? (Sorry for spoilers!)

And the best part about *Cyberpunk*? The game tailors itself to exactly what I desire! I had an awesome romp through a thrilling action-RPG, but my best friend got an excellent platformer! Someone else got the perfect kart racer! And another guy got the fantasy/sci-fi football manager he had always longed for!

Truly, this game is going to be the hallmark for all games - nay, all media to succeed it. I can't wait for the movie, the novel, the T-shirt, the Pogs, and of course, the tabletop RPG that will be based on this game. I love *Cyberpunk 2077*, and it loves me.

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.",83,1522603482.0,/r/Games/comments/88qf0e/cyberpunk_2o77_review_thread/

88qf0e,KULAKS_DESERVED_IT,"What is Berlin? Berlin, as a city, brings nothing but shame to Germany on the international stage. When comparing Berlin with other European capitals such as London, Paris, Madrid and Amsterdam, any decent human’s face must blush in humiliation. Even small countries like Austria, Belgium or Switzerland have Vienna, Brussels and Zurich: presentable cities, complete with high standards of living. Germany gets punished with Berlin, capital of losers. In all the republic, Berlin is home to the largest number of arseholes by far. Deutsche Bahn, Bundestag, Air Berlin and Axel Springer are but a few examples of all the incompetent scum being kept here. Glorious times have long since passed, the city is face down in the dirt. Berliners are lazy sods to their very core. Traits that would, in any civilised culture, pass for nothing but laziness, rudeness, incompetence, dissocial personality disorder or idiocy, are taken by the Berliner and declared a way of life. That is why the Berliner harbours intense feelings of hatred for anyone who’s better than him in any way. Especially the all-around superior Southern Germany are a thorn in his side. He envies their success, and Munich makes the top on his list of hatred. That city is – and has! – everything that Berlin wants to be and have. Berliners take no interest in the fact that it is Munich that finances their dissolute lifestyle, in fact, they secretly believe that they have earned it. So instead of freeing themselves from their envious and resentful lethargy, instead of rolling up their sleeves and improve their city, they revel in their antisocial freeloading and praise their so-called global city. Culturally, Berliners are set up rather weakly, great works lie far back in history. Moreover, mispronouncing “g” as “j” is considered a great cultural feat. Advanced students have mastered ending each and every sentence with a “wa?”. The city’s culinary performance is second-rate. Here, a sausage made from glued-together, meaty odds and ends adorned with ketchup and curry powder is sold as a culinary masterpiece. Hardly any reasonable person would consider a bratwurst with ketchup a recipe, let alone the holy grail of culinary arts. Yet, in their magnanimity, the rest of the republic lets the Berliner keep his delusion, not wanting to amplify his inferiority complex. Economically, Berlin is an utter disaster, even the late GDR stood on more solid ground. The local economy is based around alternative blogs, something-something-media and, if universities are to be believed, gender studies. Disregarding his own bankruptcy, the Berliner treats himself to prestigious projects like the city palace and the airport – which, considering its inoperative nature, is likely an art installation. Moreover, the city houses all popular parties’ headquarters, who refrain from using “traitors” in their official names (Probably for marketing reasons). For the longest time, this “town’s” “mayor”, the jolly Wowibear, butchered anything he found left in a presentable state. Long story short: Berlin is Germany’s tiled coffee table. It is to Germany what Greece is to the European Union, and if it had open sewerage, it would be Germanys Romania. Berlin is a blemish, the abscess on the arse of the nation. Berlin is the uninvited party guest, who didn’t even bring any booze and wouldn’t even understand he’s not welcome if he had is teeth beaten out and got thrown down the stairs. Berlin is the Detroit of Germany and should be sold to Poland for 200 Złoty.",83,1522603000.0,/r/Games/comments/88qf0e/cyberpunk_2o77_review_thread/

72c446,Danisnotonavan,"Halo 3 to me is something such a raw sense of style; everything is just absolutely on point with a resonant identity in one single package that reminds me of everything I love about the game.

The visuals are varied, technically impressive, and colorful, making them a pleasure to look at, but also quintessentially Halo in a way that makes it stand out against everything else. The Covenant enemies, environments, and ships look fantastic, the scope and dominance of the Ark and the Forerunner structures are represented to their fullest, the green and military UNSC looks great in their home environment on Earth and in contrast with the Ark, and the cosmic horror of the Flood is shown tremendously in levels like Floodgate and Cortana.

The music too is a cohesive celebration of all of Halo's themes. It didn't bring as many new melodies to the table, but take Black Tide for example, I think it's my favorite song:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjlQVARALzA

In just one song it's got the opening dissonant choir, which is a theme more used for the Flood and echoes of the ancient history in a level where you're fighting the flood, mixes it in with the rising low brass Covenant theme in a time where the covenant are assisting the humans against the flood, and adds in the signature ancient human vibes with the driving drums because it's a human city in Africa. As the piece goes on, these layer together, and it's so appropriate to the situation and so filled with identity in ways 343's admittedly good soundtracks just haven't approached.

I personally liked the story and campaign the most out of the franchise. It absolutely has problems, as bigger lore nerds than I can attest, but every line of dialogue out of Gravemind or Truth's mouth is a pleasure to listen to and the whole thing has a sense of gravitas to it that I just love.

On top of that, it seemed to bring all the gameplay stuff in from the previous games, improve on it (or at least mix things up a little), and tie it into a big package with a neat little bow to deliver something unlike anything else. To me it still exemplifies the best the franchise could offer in a gestalten sense.

I should also mention I'm a sucker for military sci-fi and Halo has such a creative and realized universe in that regard. It really is something special.

I have no idea how Bungie pulled all that off in a reasonable amount of time.

Aside from that, I still feel like there's stuff that *Halo* did with its campaign design which still hasn't been touched by modern games (343's attempts at *Halo* included). The interplay between guns, grenades, and melee was just perfectly balanced with your mobility, and somehow *Halo* managed to perfectly balance that with all its vehicles. It's insane how easily you could flow between each element and not miss a beat. And the story? The music? So few games seem to know how to handle a narrative in over-the-top action gameplay, but *Halo* always knew. I think it's one of the most perfect incarnations of pulp sci-fi in games.

2007 was an incredible year for games and I don't know if we will ever get that good of a year again. I mean, Halo 3, CoD 4, Team Fortress 2, Portal AND Bioshock in the same couple of months? Unheard of. 

Anyways on to the questions.

1. Forge mode. 'Nuff said

2. (I haven't played in years so I don't really know) I believe it holds up. Great map and weapon design would hold this game up high. If I were to just start playing it now I believe I would be having a blast with a few buddies of mine. 

3. I don't believe there was a single map I didn't like in the stock maps. All of the maps in multiplayer were loads of fun and very well designed. You can tell Bungie really took their time and effort into designing every little corridor, flank route and overlook in the vanilla maps (can't say the same with DLC maps thoooooo) 

4. All my opinions are going to be made invalid after I answer this question but; I never really cared for campaign in the Halo games. I have tried playing them over and over again but I just can't seem to get the same feeling everyone else does with the Halo franchise. I thought it was just a solid campaign. Thats it.

Halo 3 was a solid product: Stellar story, addictive and competitive multiplayer, and a fucking map editor to boot. 10 dollar map packs. 

A cherry on top? A fucking standalone expansion, ODST.

Halo 3 will forever be in my heart as one of the best experiences of my life. Whenever I replay the campaign, and the music kicks in at just the right moment, or I watch the final scene between Chief and Cortana for the hundredth time... I still get chills.

72c446,TheMonitor58,"Well your last point, to me, is what seems the most overlooked aspect of the forum here: halo 3 brought tonnes of non-fps junkies into the fps realm, myself included. 

Most of my games are medieval fantasy, or sims; I never really jammed out to cod before or since halo. But halos 1-3 were different: they were fun for fun's sake, and brought together elements that made them feel exciting for everyone playing. 

I never became a top 1000 player, and seldom changed the stakes of one game or another, but that didn't matter because the game was just so damn fun. The music was inspiring, the worlds were interesting and colorful, and the characters were so well defined while also being fantasy-based. COD, Titanfall, you name it: they're fun FPS's, but they aren't fun for non-FPS players. It isn't fun sitting in a brown, bleak environment and playing with a whole bunch of guns that feel too real as a non FPS sort of player. 

Halo was inviting as a game, and celebrated its goofiness while also maintaining a satisfying way of playing. It didn't matter that the rocket launcher or sword was overpowered, because both were loads of fun to use. The game modes were fun, the story was thematic and exciting, and none of it felt like I had to be some war-torn vet out of Iraq to play with people. 

FPS's nowadays tend to be back where they used to be: for hardcore, agile-based people that really want precision and hand-eye-coordination as the main features in the game. There's nothing wrong with that, but that environment isn't fun for non-FPS people like myself. I've played several COD's, and none of them felt like a jovial , casual environment. 

Overwatch comes close to that feeling, but a third of the characters aren't fps based, and there is no real campaign to speak of. The community is great, but the ethos is entirely different from the sort of vibe that halo brought together. 

I would love to see a game that could be like Halo 3 again, in the way that it was a fun game for everyone, regardless of how *legit* you were with the battle rifle or some garbage. ",70,1506365016.0,/r/Games/comments/72c446/halo_3_came_out_10_years_ago_today/

72c446,,"I think halo 4 deserves some blame here too. It's not AS BAD as halo 5 but a lot of it killed the uniqueness of the universe Bungie built.

Fighting the faceless and lame forerunners sucks. They're just bullet sponges with zero personalty. The covenant were great. If you took out an elite, the grunts would scatter and scream and say hilarious stuff, they'd even try suicide attacks. If you bombarded a jackel, he'd take cover. The grunts would be brave when there were elites around, and the elites would yell out battle challenges at you. The forerunners do literally none of this. The only way you could make them more boring to fight is by making them say ""boring"" everytime you hit their weak spot. Also removing a lot of the mystery of the forerunners is stupid. I think keeping them in the books and hinting at them through cookies and easter eggs is better. Bungie built up this mysterious race of planet building aliens then 343 gave us ""they're just fucking lame robots"".

Then you got the covenant again, but this time they're a splinter group! It's cheapens the ending of Halo 3 because now you've got a bunch of aliens that we've supposedly made peace with attacking us. Better yet, they got rid of you being able to understand them, so now they're just faceless, boring bullet pinatas as well.

Then they somehow made Spartans boring and generic as well. You know that side character you liked!?!?! HE'S A SPARTAN NOW! We also took one of his personality traits and flanderized the crap out of it.

Plus the combat is just so rewarding for whatever reason, with the enemies taking cover and just having these open battlefields. The atmosphere is unrivaled, I look at the graphics and art style today on the master chief collection and it's more aesthetically pleasing to me than any other game, just the warm vibe of the rain forest, the desert, etc. combined with the music it's just spectacular.

2007 was also the time when COD4 came out and took the franchise away from WWII and started gaining the monster momentum it has today. So now there a bajillion different options and there's more of a split between PC/PS4/XB1.

Everyone yearns for a true reboot or some sort of resurgence but that ship has sailed. Half of what made Halo 3 special was simply the fact it was 2007 and on the Xbox 360.

That and the fact that the game seemed so mysterious and promising to me as a kid. I feel like I understand games on another level as an adult. I understand the limitations. Back then games like Halo 3 and World of Warcraft seemed like this amazing uncharted territory where social gaming was the future and that we'd be playing even more amazing concepts a decade later. I mean, cool adults online had jobs filmmaking in a video game. That was insane to me at the time. I thought every new exciting game would spawn jobs and opportunities in the real world like Halo 3 did.

But honestly, I haven't had a gaming experience as profound as Halo 3 since it came out.

Nintendo has domination over the in-depth gaming on the go (call it handheld gaming if you want, or not). The sort of thing you want when you're on a long trip/commute, or when you're in bed sick all day.

Cell phones have domination over the quick, often arcade like gaming on the go (call it mobile gaming if you want, or not). What you want when you're on a subway ride for 5 minutes. They seem like a natural successor to flash games.

Technically they both have both, some popular Switch games are on the more basic side (like Baba is You), and some phone games are pretty in depth (though honestly I can't name one that isn't a port, the phone game ecosystem is a huge waste of potential IMO).

Nintendo used to get both back in the GameBoy era, and their focus has shifted slowly toward the in-depth end (helped naturally by increasing console power).",257,1576346966.0,/r/Games/comments/eahqms/xbox_series_x_size_is_almost_double_the_volume_of/

If the SSD, GPU, and CPU (maybe RAM too, but at least the big three) plug into proprietary cards/cartridges/slots on a rack, inside a Xbox shell, they could easily be aligned and accessed by anyone, in this setup/shape. The physical design of all previous generations clearly did not consider this (barring anomalies, such as the N64's expansion pack  slot); so either Microsoft is letting form follow function, or they really didn't want to look like *just another home console.* There's nothing wrong with that either, of course.

The last phase of current gen (i.e. mid-gen high-power variants, and even stripped down variants) may have set the bar for the next gen. If we don't have truly modular consoles with this coming generation, I have zero doubt that it will be *the* feature of the following generation.

gjz8mi,KvotheOfCali,"Fingers crossed that the July reveal event goes well. Microsoft REALLY needs for its first-party games debut to be impressive. 

Up to this point, the Xbox marketing has been on-point, with the possible exception of the ""next-gen games debut"" last week for third-party titles. It didn't have any of the ""gameplay"" that people were expecting, though Microsoft is somewhat beholden to whatever their partners are willing to show. Still, the messaging for the event was poor. 

The Series X is an extremely powerful console, headed by a man who understands and sincerely loves gaming, and they now own a large portfolio of first-party studios. But they still need to rebut the long-standing criticism of ""Xbox has no games"" and hopefully this July event will accomplish this task. 

Halo Infinite is the most important game in the history of the Xbox brand. It's the flagship launch title for the new console. It's attempting to help kick-off a recovery generation where Microsoft can gain back some market share from Sony after getting its butt kicked this gen. And finally, it's attempting to return Halo to the forefront of the FPS/competitive gaming scene. Back in 2004-2008, Halo was THE GAME. The past decade hasn't been as kind to the franchise. 

I'm hopeful that 343i has learned from its mistakes and will return to the core tenets that made the original games so memorable. The behind-the-scenes video they released about creating the announcement trailer has me hopeful.

This opinion is probably dated, but when I played it years ago it had a number of issues. Here's what I remember (I'm probably forgetting some stuff):

* The playlist selection was woeful by Halo standards. The few standard modes were all serious competitive playlists. Nothing casual. It didn't even have Big Team Battle!
* When they did add BTB it only used forge maps.
* Too many forge maps in general.
* Warzone was a casual and larger scale mode they had out of the gate. It was Halo 5's big new multiplayer thing. I thought it sounded pretty cool when reading about it before release. Playing it though revealed it to be a boring slog. None of my friends liked it.

I'm sure the game is much better now, but I've since moved on. Among my friend group I lasted the longest. The others bounced off Halo 5 multiplayer faster than any Halo before it. And they didn't even hate the new movement. I think there's more to a game's strength than just core gameplay. You need to wrap that core gameplay in some good shit too.

Halo has gotten stagnant to me and I hope they do more to mix up the next game.

I’m probably not gonna have a popular opinion but I think the focus on esports killed all the fun in halo 5 for me. All the maps are so boring and the game constantly feels like you’re being made spammed because of bad map design. 

In halo 5 player movement got faster but map size got way more linear and small so the game just feels like a cluster fuck at all times.

The series was only ever great because of its tech and innovation. The story was cool, but when Halo: Combat Evolved came out, no one said “Wow, this is great because of the Halo rings!” It was because the AI was far ahead of its time. Halo 2 was great because it basically invented FPS console matchmaking. Halo 3 was huge because the series was concluding, the graphics were a step forward (it was the first Halo on 360), the multiplayer was the most polished in gaming to date, and the multiplayer gameplay was tight.

The story and voice acting all helped along the way, but the game would have been just another sci-fi shooter without the innovation, without it being ahead of its time each time a game came out. And that’s what the game has been missing since 3, but really since Bungie left. It’s different people making the games... why should it stay an engine of change? That’s really hard to do.

I recently listened to a Bombcast where they say that Valve never made HL2 Episode 3 because they didn’t have a tech innovation to give them a reason to make it.

I think this is an easy to go to statement for most people given the context under Halo 4 mulitplayer's release and subsequent failure, but I don't think it's strictly true across the board. At the very least it's not what I'd consider the sole, or even most core reason. Many of Halo 5's multiplayer changes gained good faith in its community.

Arena multiplayer with slow paces, map control, and on-map power weapons hasn't been the face of FPS multiplayer for a very long time now. The scene has moved on for the most part, and there's a wider variety of titles to choose from. People seem to be spending their time with games that are faster, have more customization, higher stakes, and more focused gameplay options instead of 12 different playlists. 

This of course isn't to say these are, or aren't strengths in their own rights. It's just that the gameplay of Halo's prime hasn't been part of what sells currently. Bringing that gameplay back isn't likely to skyrocket Halo's popularity again on its own, at least not for a solid spell.

Nowadays, it will be a multiplayer shooter competing with every other multiplayer shooter. The genre has been done to death, and I really can't see any way Halo can revitalize the formula.

>The original idea for the level Cortana was entirely scratched. Originally, the level had a proper High Charity geometry completely different from the geometry seen inside the Flood-infested cruiser in Floodgate. The player had to follow Cortana's footprints to know where to go. As to why Cortana would be able to leave such footprints, Bungie designer Dan Miller likened the situation to her mysterious appearance in the closing cutscene of The Covenant. **Once Cortana was rescued, the player was to encounter a Scarab with damaged hind legs. The Chief would have to insert Cortana so she could take control of it. Then, the Gravemind would appear and a battle between him and Cortana's Scarab would ensue. The Chief would have to hold his position on the Scarab by fending off invading Flood forms and shooting off the Gravemind's tentacles that would try to latch on the Scarab.** Eventually, the entire level —including its specific High Charity geometry— had to be cut from the game's development.

A woman eventually puts on a pair of pants, one character explains **white privilege** and why the people in the “southern” end of the map look at him funny, another says that Native Americans were—in what is at least acknowledged as being grossly reductive—“treated poorly,” and everyone generally contemplates the horrors of racism and the aftermath of slavery.

It's why Steam (who also take 30%) cut can still often sell new releases cheaper, they aren't relying on those retail places to sell any hardware.

Edit: These numbers may not be correct, going off foggy memory on those, but it's not a huge difference between the two. ",59,1540467434.0,/r/Games/comments/9r95iy/red_dead_redemption_2_review_thread/

9r95iy,caninehere,"I loved TW3 but I don't get this. It felt like every other open world game, it was just a new level of quality and detail that is missing in Bethesda and AC games (and I don't think the AC games are bad,I am less fond of Bethesda titles).

Personally Breath of the Wild was the only game I have played in years where it felt like it actually innovated on what the open world could be. It's a truly open world where you can go anywhere and enjoy everything at your own pace with few limits... And most importantly it pushes exploration and adventure above all else instead of quest markers and economies and crappy levelling systems (the only skill building being your hearts/stamina and your actual skill with the game).

I doubt RDR2 is much like that. It's probably like every other third person open world game to come out in the last 10 years like [insert PS4 exclusive here].

And I'm not trying to shit on it, I want to play it but I'm just waiting for a PC version because I am not double dipping like with GTA V. **I can wait because RDR2 is very unlikely to be anything revolutionary, just the same old shit done very very well which at this point isn't enough to get me to buy a game at full price.**",151,1540470525.0,/r/Games/comments/9r95iy/red_dead_redemption_2_review_thread/

9r95iy,xRIOSxx,"I just read the article. This has always been my concern with Rockstar games, and why I've never finished one and decided I probably wouldn't purchase RDR2.

This quote from the article sums it up for me:


>

""I only rarely found Red Dead 2 to be “fun” in the way I find many other video games to be fun. The physical act of playing is rarely pleasurable on its own. It is often tiring and cumbersome, though no less thrilling for it. No in-game activity approaches the tactilely pleasing acts of firing a space-rifle in Destiny, axing a demon in God of War, or jumping on goombas in Super Mario Bros. Red Dead 2 continues Rockstar’s longstanding rejection of the notions that input response should be snappy, that control schemes should be empowering and intuitive, and that animation systems should favor player input over believable on-screen action.

Pressing a button in Red Dead 2 rarely results in an immediate or satisfying response. Navigating Arthur through the world is less like controlling a video game character and more like giving directions to an actor. Get in cover, I’ll tell him, only to see him climb on top of the cover. Did I press the button too late? Did my button-press register at all? Dude, get down, I’ll cry, as his enemies begin to open fire. He’ll slowly wheel around, then slide down to the ground with an elaborate stumbling animation. GET IN COVER, I’ll command, pressing the “take cover” button for what feels like the sixth time. He’ll haul his body weight forward, then finally crouch behind the wall""


The world looks incredibly interesting and well designed, but I've never loved actually playing their games because of the control. Still, I'm glad it's getting high reviews and many people will love it. Maybe when it's on sale I'll give it a go.

Thanks for pointing me towards the article!

I don't have a problem with the idea that a 10/10 is not a perfect game. BotW is a 10/10 game for me but it has its faults. Every game does. And I'm sure RDR2 is no exception, but very few reviewers seem to be pointing them out.

Partly because I imagine Take-Two is slinging around plenty of money for good reviews and streaming coverage as they spend an INSANE amount on advertising R* games, and because fanboys will jump up a critic's ass the moment they say anything negative about RDR2 which is why this reviewer feels they have to apologize in the first place.

There's also the question of how much the different modes should impact the score. For example I loved GTA V, would give it a very good score. Let's say I thought it was a 10 (I don't but let's just say that). IMO GTA Online was not done very well and it was kind of a clusterfuck when it launched too. Does that drag the game's score down? Or if I can enjoy the single player and just ignore the multi is it still great? Another example I would give is DOOM 2016, which got very good scores for its single player even though the multi was widely panned and hated.",54,1540469734.0,/r/Games/comments/9r95iy/red_dead_redemption_2_review_thread/

Wont be a massive difference, and wont matter just yet, but it's something, especially since every game has to be on the S too and if this gen lasts 8 years then thats games having to run on the S for 8 more years.

>The Xbox Series S runs the Xbox One S version of backward compatible games while applying improved texture filtering, higher and more consistent frame rates, faster load times and Auto HDR.”

It seems they're approaching BC with a 'one stop shop' solution, rather than a 'per title' optimization. 

The 3 'One X Enhanced' benefits were any combination of the following:

* Higher frame rate

* Higher texture res

* 4K

4K is out of the picture. Higher framerate is coming to all titles (One X enhanced or not) and higher texture res is being swapped with texture filtering (which isn't better but its still an improvement).

Not every game will meet that standard unless Microsoft take the unprecedented move of refusing certification to any game that doesn’t, which looking at the launch lineups doesn’t look like the case. 

After both consoles launch you’re going to see a lot of Series S vs PS5 DE comparisons videos on YouTube (even if it is an unfair comparison to make) and those small compromises the Series S has made are going to add up.

EDIT: Yep, I’ve received way too many notifications telling me that 30FPS is actually the worst thing ever and “complete shit”. People are so pathetic. I feel sad for all of you - missing out on some incredible games because 30FPS is apparently unplayable 

And as one last attempt for any future people who feel the need to try and convince me - I’m not saying that 30FPS is preferable to a higher frame rate, or that developers shouldn’t prioritize higher frame rates. They should. Higher frame rates are always better.

Nintendo Entertainment System. Simple enough. Super Nintendo. More powerful than the last because of the ""Super"" prefix. Same with Playstations 1-5. You know each one is the next iteration, because they started with 1, and followed through the scheme with 2-5.  Even 3DS to New 3DS - it's unclear as hell, because ""new"" is alreayd a term used in console buynig to differentiate between whether a console is newly produced, straight out of the box, vs. being used, refurbished, or bought-secondhand, but you can look at the two and go ""the New is probably stronger or better than the regular"" because of the New.

You're completely right. 

Do people even understand what rendering is? When you play a game on your PC or your console and it plays a cinematic cutscene like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1Vo3hYt_is) or [this](https://youtu.be/9O7ijJjcWvM), the game isn't rendering that every time. It's playing a video file. Your TV or your Blu-Ray player aren't being asked render the climax of Avengers End Game.

The highest end PC of all time would not be able to render a cinematic like that in real time. It takes hours upon hours upon days upon weeks depending on the quality.

If it were gameplay being played on an RTX 2080Ti and you said it was played on an Xbox, then sure, you could call it deceptive. But the rendering of a cinematic trailer? Please.",201,1590875739.0,/r/Games/comments/gtjd65/scorn_interview_xbox_series_x_is_a_very_balanced/

It is definitely the best writing Bethesda has ever put forward. Low bar, but it is decent. Definitely the most compelling plot hook for any Fallout or Elder Scrolls game.

This is still GameBryo and it continues to not age well. Even on PC, there's some harsh loading times on occasion. It's not pretty. But it's servicable.

The new conversation system is pretty much just standard BioWare and it both does and doesn't work. It does make the game more 'cinematic' but I really found myself just missing the old system because there's too much goddamn game to sit around with lengthy chats.

The new perk system is imposing as hell. You really have to go in with a good idea of where you want to take your character because there's way too many options and they're not really effectively put into nice trees like Skyrim.

VATS feels good. The game runs just fast enough while in VATS to give you a moment to make decisions, but still provide a sense of urgency to making those decisions.

All in all, it's a good game. I don't know how well it will age on multiple playthroughs and I have far, far from experienced all of it. But it's fun. It's a Bethesda game. You know what you're getting.",154,1447078491.0,/r/Games/comments/3s4k5n/fallout_4_review_thread/

Marty O'Donnell's firing is something that ought to be touched upon too. Marty had creative differences with the way Destiny was being handled. As many of us know, Destiny saw a complete change in what it was going to be in 2013 and dropped its story in favour of the game model it represents today (this is partly why Joe Staten left as he had been writing the story). It was massively inconvenient but something Marty could get around. Then the marketing team decided to use licensed songs instead of Marty's composed music, something no Bungie game had done since Marty had been at the company.

I can't remember the exact details but either way it was like a snub on Marty's work. After that, they cancelled the release of his ""Music of the Spheres"" record which was supposed to release before Destiny. Marty was justifiably pissed and made his complaints known. Harold Ryan, the then CEO, had the Board of Directors come together to fire Marty without final pay. It was a sour note to end such a long partnership. Marty then sued Harold Ryan and Bungie for his final pay. He didn't do it out of spite but simply to receive what he was rightfully owed.

Now as one of the founders of Highwire Games, he is in a much happier environment and has a prequel soundtrack coming out before the release of Highwire's first game which will have its own soundtrack.

Yeah I'm not sure why people are still holding games to that standard, but not other media. Some of the same folks that watch every Marvel movie in theaters, for example, will shit on a game for nOt dOiNg AnYtHInG NeW. You can set your watch to the story beats in those movies. Does that make them unworthy of your time? Same thing for genre books and shows. If they don't meet the conventions of the genre -- whether that's horror or fantasy or whatever -- they get shit on at best, if not ignored entirely.

Anybody here that is an artist or a writer, or has studied art or the humanities in general, knows that great art is often a synthesis of ideas that came before. This is especially true since the mid-20th century or so. We even have a word for it: *pastiche.* And it's not an insult. I mean, consider the sheer volume of content being created and shared since the rise of mass communication. If we set our standard for art or media to groundbreaking, we'll miss out on a lot of worthwhile experiences. 

I think if games are to be taken seriously, we shouldn't demand a brand new revolutionary game mechanic in *every single one.* Don't get me wrong -- it's great when a dev *does* find a way to do something new.

Evil and incompetent corporations? Yep that's it, there's nothing more to it, no surprises or depth.

The Good Guy scientist? Yep he's just a good guy that's trying to save the colony, no ulterior motive or anything at all.

Secluded family that gives creepy vibes? Oh boy if it isn't the cannibal quest!

The tough independent space ship guys? Same shit as above.

There wasn't a moment where I felt like my expectations were subverted or I was surprised by what happened in the story, it was all straight forward and simple.

The shooting is passable but combined with the shallow and boring perk system makes the gameplay feel boring.

I also never felt compelled to explore any location on my own because I knew I would eventually get a quest connected to every location that is worth exploring.

6/10

In many ways, Andromeda feels like a vision half-fulfilled. It contains a dizzying amount of content, but the quality fluctuates wildly. Its worlds and combat shine, but its writing and missions falter--and the relative strength of the former is not enough to compensate for the inescapable weakness of the latter. As a Mass Effect game, Andromeda falls well short of the nuanced politics, morality, and storytelling of its predecessors. For me, the series has always been about compelling characters and harrowing choices, so to find such weak writing here is bitterly disappointing. Yet even after 65 hours, I still plan on completing a few more quests. The game can't escape its shortcomings, but patient explorers can still find a few stars shining in the darkness.",245,1489993571.0,/r/Games/comments/60f36t/mass_effect_andromeda_review_thread/

>In many ways, Andromeda feels like a vision half-fulfilled. It contains a dizzying amount of content, **but the quality fluctuates wildly.** Its worlds and combat shine, but its writing and missions falter--and the relative strength of the former is not enough to compensate for the inescapable weakness of the latter.

This also explains the wide range of review scores. It's not that people have so wildly different standards when it comes to quality (though that may also be a factor), it's just that with a ~ 60 hour semi-open world game that is so inconsistent, it's all about what chunk of the game you remember the most. Or choose to remember.  

There's no doubt that there is fun to be had in this game, this was evident from the trial. But if you really want to give an honest review you can't cherry pick, you have to take the bad with the good (of course different people weigh different aspects higher or lower). From all that I've read, seen and played it just seems very middle of the road to me, which is reflected in most of these scores. Everything is just alright, nothing exceeds expectations and some things fall short.

That doesn't make sense: it can only mean we're still in the transition to a more realistic rating system where games, like movies today, are rated with scores reflecting how good/bad they really are: does the game suck or isn't worth the price asked?

Main problem I'm seeing here is, even if the combat gets better, Mass Effect still isn't a game I'd want to buy for the combat. If I want good shooting, I rather play Doom or Shadow Warrior 2. They are better and well paced pure combat. 

Story, charachter and roleplaying is what I'm mostly expecting from a RPG (aside from RPG-combat). Good combat is just a bonus atop of it.",757,1489997877.0,/r/Games/comments/60f36t/mass_effect_andromeda_review_thread/
60f36t,BigGucciMontana,"I disagree to a extent. 

I think they struck a amazing balance with Mass Effect 2, with much better combat & equal, if not better, writing.

Mass Effect 3 had a slight writing dip, but was still great in my opinion. 

Dragon Age 2, despite it's faults, I think had a good story, even as it was constrained by shit level design & rushed development.

Inquisition is when things began to trend down in my opinion. And it's not that Inquisition was really bad in my opinion....just stretched, boring & distant...

It's weird though, because Bioware has always had cheesy writing to a degree, and I've always had a love-hate relationship with it, but at the same time it always felt like they put real heart & soul into it....which always ended up giving their games this great authenticity & emotional connection for me....

Nowadays though...the vibe they give off in their writing is vapid, thin & just try-hard....with ALL of the cheesiness still there turned up to the max....

Honestly I knew we were all fucked when the lead writer or developer tweeted off a answer with the phrase *""make sexy times""*.....it was then I knew the neckbeards had assumed control....     ",202,1490003744.0,/r/Games/comments/60f36t/mass_effect_andromeda_review_thread/

60f36t,SomewhatSpecial,"That quest's only redeeming feature is that it allows a player to affect the world in a major way, but that's nowhere near enough. The story also has to make sense and not be a contrived mess of plot holes and contradictions. Let me give you a brief walkthrough of that particular quest:

* I arrive to Megaton and realize that the town was built around an unexploded nuclear bomb. This immediately raises several questions, like 'why the fuck would someone build a town around a live bomb?' The thing still leaks radiation, for fuck's sake! If they absolutely had to settle in that location, why wouldn't they remove it?

* A guy comes up to me and asks me to rig the bomb to explode. Why the hell would he assume that I (as in, the main character) would be willing to do such a thing? Do I have 'sociopath' written on my forehead? Oh yeah, and apparently Tenpenny wants Megaton destroyed because it ruins his view from the tower or something. Sure.

* I go the sheriff and he asks me to disarm it instead. Again, why didn't you do that already? It only takes like 25 points in explosives, which amounts to rudimentary skills. You couldn't find anyone before? Why would you trust me, a random stranger, to do it? Why is the bomb unguarded and out in the open where anyone can come up and mess with it?

The answer to all those questions is that someone at Bethesda thought 'Wouldn't it be cool if there's like a town built around an atom bomb and then you get to explode it?' and then didn't do much thinking after that. It's an awfully written incoherent mess of a quest and that's pretty much the baseline for Fallout 3's writing.

Edit: in fact, since I'm high and have nothing else to do, let me try my hand at designing the same quest. You can probably stop reading at this point.

-----
You arrive at Megaton. It's the same city as in Fallout 3, except there's a guarded dig site in the middle. Everyone seems on edge and if you ask around, they tell you that they were constructing a new building and dug out a live nuclear bomb in the process. 

If you go to the sheriff he tells you that they can't decide what to do. Some people just want to fill up the hole and forget about it. Many think that they all should leave and resettle in a new spot. From this point you have several options: 

1) convince him that they should all forget about it (this ends the quest and in the ending slideshow you see that megaton randomly exploded several years later)

2) convince him to move the bomb to some empty field far from the city (This can be a short subquest where you help them move the bomb to that location, and maybe there's some group that wants to steal it and it attacks along the way and if you let them steal it, the ending narration says they exploded another city somewhere. Anyway...)

3) convince him to leave (triggers the ending when some NPCs leave and form a shitty village called Gigaton in another part of the map, but most decide to stay. In the ending slides Gigaton becomes very prosperous and most people move there. And Megaton explodes)

4) Convince him that you can  disarm the bomb, which requires either high speech or 60 points in explosion (basically the same as 100 since who the hell builds into explosion). If you fail, he sends you to a cave full of draugr where you can find a guy who's an explosions expert who lived in the town but then left for some reason. You can convince, coerce or compensate him to help you and he gives you a detailed list of instructions to follow.

So, if you're disarming the bomb, there's a scene when all NPCs move outside the city and then one of them comes up to you and it's like a shady guy. He tells you that his employer, Tenpenny runs a different settlement wants to get rid of the competition (they're messing up his trade routes or something) and this is a great opportunity since no one will be harmed. He gives you some money in advance and even tells you that he'll help out the people to get a new start, since he doesn't want to harm them and it's all about business for him. You can tell he's bullshitting if you have high speech or PER. 

You get to the bomb. You decide if you want to set it to explode on a timer or disarm it. But then, the skill check comes up and it's not 60, it's 75! Oh shit, motherfucker! No-one has 75 explosion! What are you going to do now? But it's ok there's like an alternative way. Also magazines and mentats.

So if the bomb explodes you come back and see that shady guy and his goons have killed all the Megaton people. You can say 'whatever' and grab your reward, or kill them and start another awesome quest chain where you dismantle Tenpenny's criminal organisation (and grab your reward from their dead bodies)

If you disarm it you come back and see that shadyguy and the goons have the Megaton NPCs at gunpoint, waiting for the bomb to explode. You either fight them or convince them to leave somehow. Then get your reward from the sheriff. potentially go on awesome crimefighting quest. happy ending slides.   ",240,1490014955.0,/r/Games/comments/60f36t/mass_effect_andromeda_review_thread/

60f36t,AOTF-K,"As one of the reviewers (Attack of the Fanboy), it's this. You hit it perfectly. Most gamers don't play games that are actually deserving of a 1-5 out of 10. Hundreds of games are released every year, but the ones people play and read reviews about are just the cream of the crop. AAA development rarely puts out a game deserving of a 1-5 out of 10, because there are checks against that. They can't re-write a game, which is what ME:A needs, but they can make sure that it's not made up of just basic Unity assets, and that it doesn't crash every fourth time you start it up.

As a reviewer I've played some terrible games, and given many of them a low score, many that were below 2.5/5. But, those reviews get next to no readers over their entire life, because no one is playing that game. It hit the market and disappeared in a matter of hours.

As far as the movie review comparison, every movie that releases in theaters is a big event, so even terrible ones get reviews. Hell, the terrible movies usually top the charts *cough*Transformers*cough*. Gamers seem to have better tastes overall and understand when a game is actually bad, so there's usually no need to review it. And game reviews take far longer to put together. A movie review takes 2 hours to prep for, but even the worst game will take 10+ hours just to get to a point where you feel educated enough to give your opinion.",85,1490018479.0,/r/Games/comments/60f36t/mass_effect_andromeda_review_thread/
60f36t,TruthfulCake,"This is the correct response. A score of 1-4 generally denotes a game which is buggy, unplayable or actually really bad, with a 5 being average/meh. 

Most mainstream games will never score in this range because they are the work of a lot of people and have a great deal of quality control to stop a lot of the technical issues. At worst they score a 'good but has a lot of issues' mark.

For everything that's not great about Andromeda, it's still a 'good' game without huge glaring flaws that also does a lot of things right. It's just the bar for an RPG game (hell, even for a game in general) lately has been raised so much that a good game just isn't good enough, especially with how time poor most adults are.

7bo023,Elfdemon,"Billy Zane was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Thalia and William George Zane, Sr., both of whom were amateur actors and founders of a school for medical technicians. His parents are both of Greek descent (from Chios through his mother and Mani through his father), and his family's original surname, ""Zanikopoulos"", was anglicized to ""Zane"" by his parents, who also raised him Greek Orthodox. He has an older sister, Lisa Zane, who is an actress and singer.

After completing a year abroad in Switzerland at The American School in Switzerland (TASIS), Zane graduated from Francis W. Parker School and attended Harand Camp of the Theater Arts, located in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin.

Zane's first two screen roles were in the science fiction films Back to the Future in 1985 and Critters in 1986, around the same time he appeared in the music video for Sheena Easton's song ""Do It For Love"". In 1988 he played Tony Gambini alongside Jessica Fletcher in Murder, She Wrote: A Very Good Year for Murder. Zane also appeared in an episode of Matlock entitled ""The Nurse"". In 1989 he reprised his henchman role in Back to the Future Part II. Earlier that same year, Zane gained international recognition with the role of villain Hughie Warriner in the thriller Dead Calm, alongside Nicole Kidman and Sam Neill. He also starred in the NBC film, The Case of the Hillside Stranglers (1989).

Zane's first starring role was in a 1990 independent film, the low budget science fiction thriller Megaville. In 1990, he also co-starred in the film Memphis Belle, a film version of a 1944 documentary about a World War II Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber, as the bombardier. Zane also forayed into television work, and in 1991 he appeared as John Justice Wheeler in several episodes of David Lynch's hit TV-show Twin Peaks. In 1992 Zane co-starred alongside Tilda Swinton in the film adaptation of Virginia Woolf's novel Orlando. In 1993, he played the Shakespearean actor ""Mr. Fabian"" in Tombstone, and took a starring role in Sniper.
He also starred in a couple of Tales from the Crypt productions, including Tales From the Crypt Presents: Demon Knight, where he played a henchman of Satan called The Collector, and the episode ""Well-Cooked Hams"", where he played a poorly skilled magician who killed to steal good tricks from other magicians. In 1996, Zane played the eponymous classic comic book hero in the big budget action film The Phantom, based on Lee Falk's comic.

Zane played the snobbish millionaire misanthrope Caledon Hockley in James Cameron's 1997/98 blockbuster Titanic. This role as Rose's (played by Kate Winslet) fiancé earned him an MTV Movie Award nomination for ""Best Villain"" and a Blockbuster Entertainment Award. He was also nominated for a SAG award.

In 1998, he starred in and produced I Woke Up Early the Day I Died, a silent film based on Ed Wood's last script, intended as a parody on bad filmmaking. He won several awards at the B-Movie Film Festival, including Best Movie and Best Actor, for this work. The year after, he starred opposite Timothy Dalton, Bruce Payne, Sean Pertwee and Leonor Varela (who became his fiance after shooting ended) in a TV-movie about Cleopatra. Zane played the part of Mark Antony.

The same year, he lent his voice to John Rolfe in Disney's Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World and voiced Etrigan the Demon in an episode of The New Batman Adventures.

Zane was instrumental in getting the critically acclaimed film The Believer made, which won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance Film Festival in 2001. In it, he portrayed neo-Nazi Curtis Zampf, and starred opposite Ryan Gosling. The same year, he also had a cameo as himself in the comedy Zoolander.
Zane appeared on Broadway in Chicago, where he played lawyer Billy Flynn.

Zane also had a recurring role in the television series Charmed in which he played poetry-loving ex-demon Drake. He also provided the voice of Ansem, the main antagonist of the 2002 video game Kingdom Hearts. Archive audio of Zane was later used for Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, and though he was originally to continue voicing the character throughout future installments, Zane was replaced by Richard Epcar for the rest of the series from Kingdom Hearts II onwards. Zane's performance, however, was kept for the Kingdom Hearts Final Mix remaster in Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 ReMix.

In 2006, Zane starred in Arthur Allan Seidelman's West End production of Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks as an acerbic gay dance instructor opposite Claire Bloom.[ The same year, he appeared in the Turkish film Valley of the Wolves Iraq (Kurtlar Vadisi: Irak in Turkish), part of the Kurtlar Vadisi franchise. The film tells the story of the U.S. Army run amok in Iraq, eventually brought into check by a Turkish soldier. Zane plays Sam William Marshall, a cruel U.S. soldier who is the main antagonist in the film.

He took over Timothy Olyphant's role as Christina Applegate's ex-boyfriend on Samantha Who?. The show, however, was not renewed for the 2009–2010 season.

Zane is a principal at RadioactiveGiant, a film and television production and distribution company. Zane stars in the action/thriller film The Kill Hole.

In January 2017, Zane appeared in a commercial for KFC as a gold-colored Colonel Sanders to pitch the restaurant chains newest limited-time flavor, Georgia Gold Honey Mustard BBQ chicken.

Zane executive-produced a CD by bluesman Tim O'Connor that includes three songs from Dead Calm, in which Zane had one of the lead roles.

Zane was married to actress Lisa Collins from 1989 until 1995. He was also engaged for a time to Chilean actress Leonor Varela, his costar in the television film Cleopatra (1999).

Zane was later engaged to marry British model turned actress Kelly Brook, whom he met when starring with her in the movie Survival Island (2005), also known as Three. They split in April 2008, got back together again shortly thereafter, then ended the relationship in August 2008. Zane dated Croatian model Jasmina Hdagha in 2010, but they broke up later that year.

Through a friend he met American model Candice Neil, who is the mother of his two daughters and to whom he is also currently engaged. Their first daughter, Ava Catherine, was born in 2011, and their second daughter, Gia, was born in 2014.

In 1999, Zane participated in the first Gumball 3000 rally, driving a 1964 Aston Martin DB5.

In November 2010, he was awarded an honorary degree from Lium University, Bellinzona, Switzerland, for his contribution to cinematography. He is the chairman of the Francesco Fucilla Film production company 21st Century Filmworks.",93,1510196785.0,/r/Games/comments/7bo023/all_kingdom_hearts_titles_in_chronological_order/

I'm almost 30 (puke noises) and recently played through 1.5 and 2.5. It was my first playthrough of all the games. Yes, the dialogue is bad. The general message is the kid friendly ""friendship overcomes all obstacles"" mantra, which doesn't appeal to me. That said, there is something special about the first Kingdom Hearts game and I can understand why it was such a big hit back in the day. It was charming. The characters, the simple story, the level design, the combat. All of it was fun and I loved it (except for the gummi ship; fuck the gummi ship). It was a wonderful nod to Disney and Final Fantasy and I'm kind of disappointed with myself for not playing it back in the day. Once the story gets more convoluted and the games increase across platforms, that's when it loses it's charm for me. Retconned story, comas, everyone getting a key blade, and clones are where the story fell flat. Towards the end it felt like a chore to complete then games then me enjoying them and the story completely lost its charm for me.

*Sword Art Online* is a good example of this, too.

ajd81q,Mr_Lafar,">  The combat is effectively two buttons, with no real elaboration battle to battle,

Just for the sake of discussion, I kind of hate when people say this about KH. Like, every ARPG that's on easy or normal is just button mashing on normal enemies and you maybe have to do something slightly different on bosses. Tales of games, press A for basic attacks and ocassionally B for skills, no need to block or dodge or anything. Ys. basic attacks work all game on normal in later entries. Breath of the Wild, Skyrim, etc, just use your sword and you're golden 99% of the time. If you play on hard, then all of these games have more depth and require you to use more mechanics. KH requires dodging and blocking, knowing what the flashy moves actually do, and strategy too, just in hard mode. I think the problem is most people don't play on more than normal for games, and unless it's Dark Souls that just makes normal the hard version, nobody bothers trying it out.",55,1548369038.0,/r/Games/comments/ajd81q/kingdom_hearts_iii_review_thread/

Back in 2007 they switched from intervals of .1 to intervals of .5, with MGS4 and GTA4 following not long after.  Roughly a year ago they ditched decimals altogether and stuck with full integers only.

Not to detract from the quality of the three games this year, but it is possible that a 10 from them now would have equated to a 9.5 in years past or a 9.6 a decade ago, which were noticeably more common.

Scores that high are usually pretty interchangeable regardless, but a 10 from them, as their scale is designed now, isn't as uncommon now as it was before.

5fc3mg,,"I've put about 40 hours into the game so far.

I rushed through the story after putting in about 10 hours of sidequests just so I could get it done by the weekend. Total play time was exactly 25 hours, so the story is probably closer to about   15 - 18 hours. That's fine, and most other FF game stories can be rushed in about the same time if you skip most side quests and optional activities.

After that, I started a new game and am taking my time with side quests and exploration. 

Here are my thoughts:

**Story:** We'll start with the bad. The story is awkward. You can feel the turmoil the development went through because it is pieced together so poorly. Tabata had a real struggle putting the puzzle pieces together. Cutscenes pop up out of no where, nothing is explained through the story, and at the end we aren't really given a reason why Noctis and Luna love each other or why their marriage means so much even if you do watch Kingsglaive and Brotherhood. For those that didn't watch those, you'll really be left scratching your head as to why anything is happening and who anyone is. Characters get hardly any screentime and too many things happen off camera. Outside of the main cast, the character interactions and relationships are virtually non-existent. 

However, the Brotrip is done fantastically well, though. The comradery is high and by the end of the game, you'll probably be in love with the 4 characters. 

**World:** The open world section is fantastic, the dungeons are fun, and it truly is a believable place. In my second playthough, I'm about 15 hours in at chapter 3, and I never want to leave the open world. It is very large, about 10 miles across, and would take you 20+ minutes or so to drive across, and who knows how long to walk across. I know some people expected a larger open world, but trust me, this is big enough. Any larger and there wouldn't be enough content to fill it.

The linear back 1/3rd of the game (about half the chapters are linear, but they are paced so quick, I think I only spent about 5 hours once I got to it) is not the best and there is one chapter that you will want to kill yourself in. A bunch of the game lore is in that chapter and it is written on notes you have to interact with rather than be told through the story. That was some poor execution.

**Combat:** So much fun, but way too forgiving and sometimes unfair. I just love how flashy and stylish the combat looks. After 40 hours, I am still not bored fighting low level trash. I wish there was an MMORPG with this kind of fighting. However, the caveat lies in that some mobs don't have telegraphed movesets, so dodging enemy moves can be a bit bullshit. For something that is supposed to be a bit tactical, how can you be tactical if you don't know something is coming? Also, bosses hit like a truck on some of those bullshit moves. 

But then, its so forgiving because as long as you have a potion which are dirt cheap, you just can't die. I know a couple bosses kept wrecking me with moves they had which weren't dodgable and had no telegraph, but that's alright, I'll just blow through 20 potions and get through it anyways. A battle of attrition, but I honestly don't know how this could be fixed.

Summoning sucks and the summon battles are terrible. I don't know how else to put it. They are boring and uninspiring. The requirements to summon aren't explained well and getting them to summon on non-scripted instances is almost impossible.

**Graphics, Sound, and Everything Else:** Great, great and great. Playing on a PS4 Pro on a 24 inch 1080p monitor, and things look great. They've really pushed the PS4 to the limit. The music is fabulous as always, the environment sound is immersive as fuck, the combat sound is soooo god damn satisfying and will have you wanting to pull off more combos, and the voice acting, both JP and EN (Except Cindy... whyyyyyy with the southern drawl?), are believable. 


**Overall:** If the story was better and the battle system retooled to make player skill a little more important rather than having to rely on items as a crutch, it'd be a perfect game. Honestly, if they took the world and assets and fight system and just made the story more cohesive and fleshed out, even if it wasn't Final Fantasy, It'd be a 9.5 out of 10 in my book, but because the story just doesn't flow and piece together well, I'm giving it an 8. The open-world section and bromance is just so much fun that it overshadows any of its downsides.

I'll never really understand the problem with ""linear"" scenarios in games. I don't think a game should be criticized on that perspective. To me that is the difference between reading a book from the first page to the last, rather than a choose your own adventure book, where it jumps from page to random page. 

Games are designed on a spectrum of Linear to Open and it is OK for games to be placed anywhere on that scale. I personally always get lost and lose motivation when playing a game that is too open (skyrim, fallout).

5fc3mg,,"A lot of PS1-era JRPGs did enough experimental, interesting things that you could probably get on board with them.  Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story, Xenogears, and Valkyrie Profile were all fantastic games that refused to adhere to the now-tired trope of ""chosen hero and his five new best friends wander around the world to save it.""

- FFT is basically Game of Thrones in game form, coupled with a deep strategy RPG that allows you to customize your army and create your own custom units by combining ability sets.  
- Vagrant Story is a single-character, ""turn-based action"" RPG about a man sent to investigate an ancient city where warring factions are trying to deal with the magic within.
- Xenogears is probably the most ""typical"" JRPG on this list, but it's an example of one that isn't afraid to punch upwards.  It does feature a ""chosen one"" hero, but deals heavily in Jungian psychology, creationism vs. darwinism, tradition vs. progression in society, and more.  It would almost be a deconstruction of the JRPG, if it didn't use the gameplay trappings of one.  Also features giant robots and a sadly abbreviated second disc.
- Valkyrie Profile is my favorite of the era.  It's a JRPG retelling of the Norse Ragnarok myth, where you play as a Valkyrie witnessing the deaths of worthy mortals and choosing to take their souls into your care, in order to nurture their eventual ascendance to Asgard so they can participate in the final battle.  Has a really neat combat system that combines turn-based strategy with elements of timing to create combos and unleash super moves.  (If you play this, make absolutely sure you choose Hard mode at the start, which is paradoxically the easier mode.)

Most of these games use 2D sprite artwork, so they age relatively well.  FFT and Valkyrie Profile also have remasters available.  I mostly picked these four games because they still adhere enough to the tropes of the genre to fall within the JRPG label, but they eschew the typical story beats and marshmallow characters in favor of an interesting narrative and gameplay that even an adult can enjoy.

EDIT:  Honorable mention to Soul Nomad and the World Eaters.  The main game is a troperiffic anime plotline about a boy who gets cursed with an evil world-destroying spirit inside of him.  Early in the game, it offers him the choice to join with it and become the Destroyer, which he obviously turns down.  After beating it, however, there's a second campaign that allows you to play the other outcome - what if he said *Yes*?  It's... rather depraved how it ends up turning out.",92,1480349815.0,/r/Games/comments/5fc3mg/final_fantasy_xv_review_thread/
5fc3mg,BlackHawkGS,"Oh, personally I don't have a clue. Honestly, I'm surprised they've survived this long in western markets, but there seems to be a decent following to keep it worthwhile for publishers.

JRPG's just do a lot of weird things when it comes to story-telling and design. Conan's ""Clueless Gamer"" episode for FFXV highlighted this. There was a part where the characters where just standing around, gawking at a wedding dress, and Conan was baffled on what was taking so long (or why that was even a quest.) Another quest had them fighting a huge boss monster, and someone told him a ways into the fight that it takes 72 real-time hours to complete.

1. Stop making the main characters look like a Japanese boy band.

3. The customization that does exist is typically un-fun and grindy in the extreme.
4. The character reactions are over the top and just plain bad. This is true in anime as well and a major reason I really can't watch it anymore. Someone makes a minor comment and then another character goes into an existential crisis.
5. A lot of it is just weird and nonsensical or arbitrary. FFXIII, looking at you. Stop trying to shove too much fantasy BS down our throats all at once. Maybe give us some context instead of relying so heavily on the user's suspension of disbelief.

>**The goal in each of the three regions is to earn enough Resistance Points to hit three milestones**

...

>With the exception of the locations of each region's hub area and the whereabouts of Specialists (support characters who provide unique abilities), **no points of interest are marked on your world map, and the traditional Far Cry (and Ubisoft game) practice of finding and scaling key structures to populate the world with icons has been removed.**

...

>While the initial expanse of the open world might cripple you with choice, the discovery system dishes out distinct options in small doses, encouraging you to follow and explore the small distractions you might find with genuine curiosity, **as opposed to because it was one of a dozen icons you arbitrarily picked as they stared at you from a minimap.**

...


>**In fact, there is no minimap**...The absence of the minimap allows you to see the trees in the forest, so to speak.

I'm really burned out on the Ubisoft open world formula, preferring the Rockstar or Bethesda approach, but it sounds like they've freshened their own systems enough to make it feel more immersive. It appears they have reduced the hubbed region design that usually makes Ubisoft open world games like more like a chore to progress, while also going a long way to reduce the instant icon vomit and make the world work without needing a minimap or the towers.

And the guardians were major disappointments, they should have been much larger to the scale of older Zelda games dungeons.

I'll be honest, i didnt finish the game, when i started i was blown away, it really is a good game and they nailed so many core aspects, but the content itself is really quite shallow, the overworld hasn't got much to find, there are so few types of enemies and i was so looking forward to the interesting take on dungeons with the guardians only for them to be complete let downs.

Its a shame because the game is beautifully designed, the world is beautiful to explore for the sake of it, there just isnt much to find and the mechanics of movement / combat etc are really spot on, i have to say i was enjoying the story, voice acting and character design too. There just wasn't enough actual gameplay to keep me interested.

How is build variety? Anything strike you as particularly overpowered or meta-warping (like Small Guns vs. Everything else in most Fallouts). What about perks/leveling?

I honestly don't know how people can be thoroughly hooked and only stick with this practice for long periods of time. Yes, to grind out that light/power level so you can have the best gear and fight the hardest bosses possible. I used to be addicted (on/off) with World of Warcraft and FFXIV, and yet those games allowed me to kee finding new things to try out for weeks. With Destiny, I just seem to hit a roadblock within days every time a new expansion is out. The worst part for me is that getting new gear feels nothing to be thoroughly excited about.

In my mind, for a game to justify being open world, it has to fulfill the criteria: if you can go there, something needs to be there. Too many open world games fall into the trap of having a huge world with nothing to do.

This is why Bethesda RPgs will always be the best Open World games to me, despite being really buggy and stuff. They are quantity over quality, which I think is needed in openworld. Elder scrolls is designed with the philosophy of “the player can do what they want”, which is a really good design for open world IMo. If you can climb a mountain, something needs to be on top of the mountain. If you can enter a house, something needs to happen in the house. If an npc exists, they should play SOME role in the game, even if just to talk to, or minor role in a quest.

When the 8th gen came, I was burnt-out on the Wii-U after beating Wind Waker HD, and decided to buy a PS4 over an Xbox One. PSNow (at the time, it's gotten better,) download speeds, and no cross-save compatibility is what made me consider switching back to Xbox (all of my friends had Xbox, but I wanted to strictly use Playstation this gen.) Gamepass was what made me come back to Xbox.

What's even weirder now is that I own almost every game on Gamepass. Gears 5 is really the only game on Gamepass that I'm interested in and don't own, and I decided 3 months of Gamepass for $1 was a better investment that paying $60 for Gears 5, beating campaign, then never playing it again.

Phil Spencer knows that making customers happy to keep them around and profiting over time is better than profiting *now*

eb35m1,AkodoRyu,"That kind of article makes little to no sense tbh. 

Not only is it a pointless, uninformed discussion, but the person who wrote it is not particularly tech-savvy and mostly just spread misinformation.

No, consoles likely won't have 12TFLOPS GPUs, because of cost and power. Yes, GPU will still be 2x as powerful as one from Xbox one X, even if it's technically 9TLOPS, because TLOPS in modern GPUs produces different real-world results than in old ones.

The change to CPU is worth way, way more than change to GPU, since that wasn't really an issue for most console games. Change to CPU will likely be responsible for way more changes in next-gen games, than more graphical power, and that's the thing that will make them impossible to port to this gen, without significant compromises.

CPU will also not be Xx ""quicker"" in terms of clock speeds or cores. Because MHz in Ryzen can do more than MHz in Jaguar.

Even mentioning 8k resolution is BS - it's just HDMI standard, there won't be 8K games, let alone ones in 120fps. Refresh rate - no, 120 is not the limit. It is a theoretical limit to the standard in 8K resolution, but it can run 4k@144, or even 4k@240 with some caveats (and anything slower than that). HDMI is just a pipe, and HDMI 2.1 is a pipe with a throughput of 42.6Gbps. If there is a screen/standard and game that can run it, it could theoretically run 1080p@960fps.

4dayln,,"Dark Souls 2 is a good game overall. The controls are tight, combat is fluid, and the DLC offers some of the best encounters found in any Souls game to date. In my opinion, here are the areas and aspects in which the game falls short...

- World design is linear and non-sensical. This issue has been talked about to death so I really won't waste anymore time beating this dead horse.

- Boss encounters in the main game are too samey. Almost every humanoid knight could be beaten with the same strategy; Circle around and attack from the rear. Many of these bosses had no answer to this.

- Too many enemies that don't play by rules. Unlimited stamina, ridiculous tracking, etc.

- Soul Memory was a pretty terrible way to fix a problem that no one really had to begin with.

- Miracle nerfs made no sense.

- Weapons break (even in SotFS) incredibly fast. You can't even clear a single area in the game without most weapons losing 3/4 of their durability. Some DEX weapons like whips and rapiers break even faster than that.

- Scholar of the First Sin, while I enjoyed some of the changes and additions, relied on artificial difficulty far too often. Putting more enemies in a room does not name the game more interesting, it makes it more bullshit. Dark Souls' controls and combat style does not lend itself well to engaging a half dozen enemies at the same time.

His problem with DS3, by contrast, is that the levels themselves aren't unique. It's all castles and crypts under castles and swamps, connected in a straight line. DS2 was linear, but not *that* linear (for the first 60% of the game there were 3 or 4 different linear paths that you could follow, so it still *felt* open, at least during your first playthrough).

Admittedly, the tone and story in DS1 was miles better than those in DS2, but DS2's story still wasn't terrible. The biggest thing DS2 has going for it though is how there are far more different types of builds to try out. You can play through Dark Souls 1 twice and play just about every viable playstyle there is. Meanwhile, I'm on my 4th playthrough of DS2, and there are still more options I'd like to try, because there are so many more weapons, spells and ways to build your character.

Indeed.

To be fair, the /r/games moderators messaged me asking to add Metacritic, but I was asleep when I got the message :-\

We'll no longer be posting review threads. I didn't think of it as self-promotion because the traffic we'd get from reddit was surprisingly low (EX: Quantum Break review thread resulted in [83 referrals](http://i.imgur.com/otAGj0b.png)). I did it because I thought it'd be helpful to keep making consistent review threads that had dozens of reviews. I wrote a super simple script to format our review data in reddit format so that we could be quick and consistent.

But I understand how it could look like self promotion, and thus I won't be posting them. Instead, we're going to add an ""export"" button so that you can export all of OpenCritic's reviews in a bbc code, Reddit, or phpbb format.

As always, 3rd parties wont put dollars and precious development time on a feature that exists on only one platform. Which brings me back to my initial point. 

There is no reason for the PS4 controller not working on a PS5 if the overall controller scheme is the same. e.g. in a typical FPS you will aim-down-sight with L2 and shoot your gun with R2.

Though there's also the whole ""once you start making games that people can criticize, people are more apt to actually unload on the next game"" syndrome. A lot of people will try to think the best of something that's bad, but the bad thing gets criticized more, so the next thing that comes along gets hammered.

The Force Awakens/The Last Jedi is a great example of this - people were like ""Ooh, Star Wars!"" and were way too nice to The Force Awakens, a movie that had many glaring flaws.

7x7xni,Chet_Awesomelad,"I've played 3.5 hours, and I must admit I am pleasantly surprised so far. Here is the good and the bad, in my opinion:

**The Good:**

* This game *nails* a lot of the roleplay mechanics. For example, Stealth - if you wear black clothing at night, it gives a bonus to Stealth, but if you walk around in black during the day it *reduces* your Stealth because it's too conspicuous. Another example is Persuasion checks - your equipment and blood stains on your clothing will influence intimidate checks because you look scarier, or you can go the opposite and wear fancy expensive clothes to try and impress people. I've yet to try some of the non-combat stuff like cooking or crafting or whatever, but so far what I've seen is good.

* There seems to be a lot of freedom when completing quests - you're given a task (e.g. retrieve an item from an NPC) and you can go about it in multiple ways (e.g. sneak in and steal it, attempt to talk it out of the guy, or just beat him up). This freedom is standard for old-school RPGs but it's something I noticed is often missing from more modern RPGs.

* The world design and graphics are stunning - this game really takes advantage of CryEngine's power, and the world is lovingly crafted in a realistic way. It really sucks you in and makes you feel like you're actually in this world.

* The sound and music are great, and makes wandering across the countryside really peaceful and rewarding. There are lots of little sounds as you wander around towns that make it sound real. I cannot stress enough just how great this game captures the look and feel of medieval Europe.

* The characters I've met so far are interesting and the dialogue is mostly relaxed and believable. I sympathise with the protagonist and can understand and believe the relationships he has with the other characters.

* The combat mechanics are really fun and challenging. Combat is tough but when you nail it, it's very rewarding. The skill-based side of it involves choosing the right angle for attacks and timing them correctly, while stats play into your damage and defence. I think it's a really good balance between traditional RPG combat and a more Action-RPG approach.

**The Bad:**

* The optimisation is lacking, for sure. This is my biggest complaint. I had to slash my graphics settings down to High or Medium (as opposed to Very High or Ultra High) to hit a mostly consistent 60 fps and even then the framerate would tank in certain places. Cut scenes appear to be locked to 30 fps too, which is jarring. Apparently this is being worked on by the devs as we speak, so hopefully this one is corrected soon.

* The load times are *punishing* if the game is on a HDD. I had to switch it to my SSD because it was taking 1 - 2 minutes to load the game and then 20+ seconds to load each *conversation*. Unless this is a bug, you absolutely must have an SSD to play this game comfortably.

* The voice acting is passable for the most part, but you do get some real amateur-sounding voice acting even for major characters in some parts. It's also a bit jarring to hear several different accents - English, Czech, and American - when all the characters are supposed to be from the same area. Not a dealbreaker at all, but just a bit of a nitpicky thing.

* The inventory could use some quality-of-life upgrades, like being able to filter with different criteria. The stats aren't really made clear and it took me a while to figure out how each piece of equipment affects them. There were some items that indicated they would give me added protection, or added charisma, but equipping them didn't change anything? I dunno, a Dark Souls-type ""help"" cursor would be really handy in this game.

**Edit** - Couple extra things (good and bad) now that I've played a further 4.5 hours:

* There are a few bugs that can be pretty annoying. You can participate in an archery contest and wager money on the outcome, but roughly half the time some of the contestants won't shoot - since you need to wait for all contestants to finish shooting, you have no choice but to forfeit and lose your money. I also had a quest where I had to shoot as many hares as possible, and afterwards I was told I hadn't shot any hares even though I had shot like 8 of them, so I lost out on a reward. AFAIK these are being addressed by the devs, but for now they're annoying.

* You can buy a dagger at the weaponsmith, but can't equip it as a weapon (it's used for stealth kills and roleplay-related stuff). The reasoning is that it's not very useful in combat against longer weapons, but surely a dagger is better than nothing?! I think this should have been made into a weapon.

* The save system makes it difficult for people who might need to leave the game on short notice. As it stands, the game saves when you sleep, when you start a new quest, or when you drink Saviour Schnapps. You can stock up on schnapps and essentially use it as a quicksave function, except the item is very expensive and it's difficult to amass money at the beginning of the game. I agree with some users who say that a 'Save and Quit' option should be added, but I don't agree that a Skyrim-style quicksave and quickload feature would add much to the game.

* The way the game handles equipment modelling is really something special. You can equip armour over clothing, or a helmet over a coif, and the in-game model will adjust accordingly so there's no overlap or clipping between the different items. It's really impressive.

* I absolutely adored going into the woods for a quest and just soaking in the nature sounds and stunning world design. It seriously is just something unlike anything I've played before - Skyrim comes close, Witcher 3 comes close, but neither of those games really nail those forest scenes as well as Kingdom Come does.",87,1518563953.0,/r/Games/comments/7x7xni/kingdom_come_deliverance_review_thread/

Outdoors and in combat my framerate has been over 60 constantly.

As for the game, I'm very much enjoying it so far. In the first 3 hours there were basically no combat encounters aside from a couple really easy ones and a couple ones that you're basically almost scripted to lose. It seems that the combat is ""janky"" by design initially, as Henry has literally just started learning how to handle a sword. It reminds me of Morrowind a bit, because that game's combat, with how reliant it was on stats, was really truly terrible feeling initially, and got better as your character progressed.

The graphical glitches most of these reviewers are bitching about are to be expected on a game of such scale, with todays hardware. There's really only so much that can be done. And if you play the game for what it is, an rpg, a few low res textures are barely noticeable imo. The pop in that everybody is crying about seems to be mostly texture changes from low to hi res as you get closer. With the draw distance this game has, it's not possible to have hi res textures everywhere, all of the time. While it can be immersion breaking when looking for it, if you're playing the game and not looking for things to moan about, you barely notice it. 

Quest bug here and there. Nothing game breaking yet and nothing that a reload hasn't fixed. I've encountered no noticeable fps drops. 

The combat is sluggish at first, but I think that's intended. You're the son of a blacksmith of a small village, who's barely even held a sword before. You're not meant to be a superhero. That's the point I think. As your character gets better, and you yourself get better with the controls, combat feels much smoother. I think the progression of character combat skills and my own learning curve lined up perfectly. 

The first time you manage to slip the point of your sword past your enemies guard and stab him in the face feels like an achievement. And he dies accordingly, no matter how good his breastplate is. When two clearly desperate, or insane, ruffians wearing only clothing and brandishing nothing more than a wooden club ambush you on the road, you dismount your armor clad ass and dispatch them in a couple of strokes, confident in your abilities and the protection your armor affords you. 

This game, for the scale, for the budget, for day 1, is fucking amazing imho. How these supposedly trusted reviewers have managed to come up with a final score already, a final verdict, is beyond me. 

Fuck reviews, including this one. Play it for yourself, don't go looking for reasons to hate it,  and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Seriously, I've played games before and enjoyed the fuck out of them, then watched some reviews to get other people's opinions, and ended up not being able to unsee all the bullshit that they point to as to why the game is a cluster fuck, ruining it for myself completely. 

Most reviewers, or gamers for that matter, have no idea what goes into making a game, and more importantly, what the limitations are. Everybody's wanting games that simply don't, and can't, exist. 

I'm not even saying you need to lower your expectations to enjoy it. My hype train was at full speed for this mofo. I'm just suggesting you don't go looking for reasons to hate it, and don't go in with unrealistic expectations. ✌️",70,1518520449.0,/r/Games/comments/7x7xni/kingdom_come_deliverance_review_thread/

From my experience, I believe these issues are just the tech behind it: Its badly optimized and it drops to less than 30 frames when various actors are close in the screen. Not smooth 60 fps on high even on an 1080 with an i7.  Other ""technical issues"" I recall are some loading screens before and after some events; sometimes you talk to someone when you shouldn't talk and it prompts a unending loading screen. The save format is shit. Everything has an animation and sometimes they don't feel right, like teleporting in front of a ladder, when you pick up some flowers or talk to people. Aside from that, I haven't found a game breaking bug, like some hilarious ones that make it into the frontage.

I find the key to combat is to get the AI stuck on something, like a fence post or a tree stump, and then wail on their back.  I'm sure people who can get better performance out of the game have found more effective strategies.

I would say that in the name of realism, they took things that are very simple in other games, and added a level of ass pain to it.  It's especially bad with a keyboard, where you're going to be reaching for combination key strokes with ctrl, shift and alt quite often.  It isn't the Skyrim simple block/bump and swing/power swing system, there's a lot of directional input to consider.

Speaking of Skyrim, this also isn't a game where you can pause combat, go into your inventory, eat a ton of raw meat, drink some health potions and come back into the fight.  Once you start dying, if you can't get somewhere to apply a bandage, you just die.  It's really unforgiving, and makes light armor stealth play high risk/high reward, with the reward being that if you stealth kill everything you don't have to get fucked to death in face to face combat.",201,1518510322.0,/r/Games/comments/7x7xni/kingdom_come_deliverance_review_thread/

There is a lot of downtime that is not fun to look at, especially early game, where you just ride from village to village recruiting peasants and then hunt small bandit bands and run from the big ones.

In all my playtime I never actually ""finished"" the game, as in create my own kingdom and conquer the map. I only created my own kingdom once and then pretty much stopped that playthrough. Whenever I start a new game, I usually have a theme in my head that I wanna stick with and just roll with it. I've done infantry only games, cavalry only, I've done playthroughs where I didn't join any kingdom as a lord and was just an elite mercenary band with high tier units that could stomp enemies double the size. I've done runs where I joined as a lord, sucked up to every other lord in the faction and when it came to awarding castles and cities I pulled on the strings and got as many fiefs as I could.

If you didn't really fell for it in the first 20 hours then I'm not sure you'll enjoy it much.

And so does most of Australia. The country is too big, not populated enough, and typically not worth the time for a developer building a game like this on a transcontinental scale.  
>  
>And yet, I can fly over and see my home. And it *looks* like my home, or at least the plot of land, the roof I’ve stood on, the corner I’ve played backyard cricket on. There’s a lack of finer detail, and I’m still several hundred feet in the air, but the streets, layout, building and the general town are enough to trigger many childhood memories.  
>  
>Having been excluded thanks to an invisible pandemic, and spending months grappling with the thought of what might happen to my sick family every time they step out for food, it was hard not to shed a tear looking over the dirt roads, curves and train tracks that marked where I grew up.  
>  
>A town like mine does not belong in a video game. It is too small to be remembered, too plain to be worthy of national, let alone international, recognition. And yet, it’s there.",215,1597653373.0,/r/Games/comments/ib9vu8/microsoft_flight_simulator_2020_review_thread/
ib9vu8,voidox,"the sheer technical achievements in this game is just mind boggling. 

From things like real-time weather system to rendering of real world airports and locations using AI-assistance/hand made, even have animals in some places, in general their use of AI technology

how they used Bing map data to render the world, the attention to detail in creating each model of plane (plane design, sound, handling, technical and so on), the real world physics in play (in basically all aspects of flight such as speed, wind, temperature, light, gravity and so on), graphics, sound, scale, real world lighting, how smartly implemented the multiplayer is 

and on and on I could go :o

as I said, man does it just blow your mind when you look at it all :o And then you can play it all with VR, kreygasm

I'm so happy to see the high scores and praise it's getting from all over. In terms of simulation games, this is a huge leap forward and the team at Asobo Studio should be REALLY proud of what they've achieved, well fcking done! 

I'm really excited to see how the gave evolves from now with post-release support and that the community has their hands on it, modding scene can work wonders and this game is already a wonder :D

And honestly, if you throw that out the window, then the budget doesn't need to be spectacularly high.

We're talking a 7-8 figure budget which is significantly more viable.

I *really* dont agree with this part. Tons of small and/or niche and budget games are perfectly popular. They may not sell as well as blockbusters, but the receptions to them from those who play is positive. 

The problem with AA games and why they in particular tend to be less popular, less liked, is because so many of them try to make AAA quality on a 'A' budget instead of knowing and working around their limitations.

OLED just looks infinitely better than LED to me.  Not the brightest TV, but since it can do perfect blacks, the contrast in the dark will exceed your actual vision.  

Like, literally.  I was playing Red Dead 2 with HDR on and the sunsets are fucking spectacular.  So much so, that I found myself squinting, so I covered the sun with my hand and discovered there was a lot more detail in the shadows than my eye was perceiving.  Just like in real life.

Besides all that, Samsung has been trying sooo hard to compete with OLED, even using the term “QLED”.... because it looks as close to the acronym “OLED” as possible. 🙄

But they finally caved and are making OLED TVs soon and abandoning their silly QLED line.  Not that those TVs are bad, I just hated their deceptive marketing.

Lady and Trish return, and watching these two women, who have been typically portrayed as just as capable and powerful as the men of these games, relegated to damsels in distress with zero agency of their own or chances to shine is more than disappointing, it feels disrespectful. This is especially apparent when, around the midpoint of the game, DMC5 sexualizes both characters in consensually problematic ways.

>While she’s not treated the same degrading way, newcomer Nico doesn’t fair much better. Somehow, Nero’s craftswoman partner is one of the primary perpetrators of some of DMC5’s worst tendencies. This includes the objectification of Lady in one instance, and near the end, undermines an entire thesis of Nero’s character to double down on some old fashion toxic masculinity.

ay0f1c,PT8,"Yet it's another interesting example in that if you ask really, really hardcore fans of the series, you're going to actually get multiple answers that the first Bayonetta game is better.

The reason for this disconnect is that Bayo 2 shines in the general feel of combat, weapon variety, as well as lack of jank and annoyances. It is a far smoother and polished experience to play through once on a normal-ish difficulty. 

Bayo 1 on the other hand has more in-depth scoring systems and less degenerate combat mechanics. When you push Bayo 2 to the highest difficulties, it starts to fall a lot on the pillars of Witch Time, Umbran Climax, and spamming specific short combos. Lots of the more subtle options of Bayo 1 ended up heavily less viable due to either being nerfed by mechanics changes, or losing out to more boring strategies that are no longer punished by Bayo 2's simplified scoring system.

In general, it's to be understood that reviews in the genre will mostly evaluate the casual experience, and not that of someone who wants to actually deep-dive into a game.

This is wrong, and it’s a bigger deal than people are letting on because they’re laypersons that don’t understand the industry or what the hell they’re looking at.

According to the following article, they posted the actual RTL source code.

This isn’t low-level driver code that interacts with the GPU, it’s literally the GPU. This code makes up the microarchitectural implementation of actual IP.

That said, it’d probably take twice as many engineers twice as long to reverse-engineer any kind of competitive architectural secret sauce.

Actual silicon engineers at the big companies like Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, Apple, etc. aren’t going to go near this with a 10ft pole, but some less scrupulous companies in China aren’t going to be as reserved. No, there won’t be bootleg Navi GPUs, that’s too simplistic a view, but it’s definitely going to give those companies a huge R&D shortcut and may affect AMDs long term competitive strategy. In 5 years those other companies could start to chip away at the low-mid range GPU market the same way Chinese companies started chipping away at the smartphone industry, which hurts AMD because they haven’t been competitive in the higher tiers in a long time.",154,1585204504.0,/r/Games/comments/fozo30/a_hacker_stole_and_leaked_the_xbox_series_x/

6kti4p,team56th,"> In my research I found 7 people out of the 135 people I researched who worked on Blood Money who are still at IO. 

WOW. JUST WOW.

Unlike the first few cases where so many of Bungie and Bioware veterans were still around, we are getting more and more interesting cases as this goes on. Io's situation is the most interesting of all though. It became a completely different company with the same name during the last generation. And to think that out of those 7, some of them might have been laid off?

You know, it's amazing that the creative force behind the old Hitman games was the one that made largely disappointing Kane and Lynch 1 and 2. Some of them were still in the company to make Absolution, also a huge deviation from the old games. And then, out of nowhere, complete newcomers make the true sequel. Has anything like this happened before?

That said, I want to ask for the reverse job of what you usually do: Can you do one for 2016 Hitman where you analyze where the key employees have come from? How many of them are  acquainted with the genre, have experience with the episodic model, or are just complete newcomer to the genre or the industry?

If you want to stay with the old model, I would like F.E.A.R.. I suspect the situation at Monolith to be very similar to Io.",324,1499008708.0,/r/Games/comments/6kti4p/hitman_blood_money_where_the_developers_are_now/

When we approach the upper echelon of review scores, 9.5 and 10 we ask ""What does this game bring to the table that can't be found elsewhere, or what footprints will it make on future games in the genre.""

It's not to say BOTW or The Witcher are perfect gsmes, or even that they aren't derrivitive off other past games in the genre. It's more that each had a component (BOTW unique physic based gameplay in an action adventufe and Witcher's sheer depth of story and detail) that Assassin's Creed: Origins doesn't have. 

But each review is viewed in the scope of ""This game in relation to itself as a standalone title, in relation to the series as a whole, and in relation to the genre or industry at large.""

And in this case, our reviewer though the game was very great and easily recommendable on its own, rivals ACII in terms of impact and change. And those points should be underscores.

The gameplay structure was ok but once you get into the meat of it it's pretty basic. Combat isn't very deep and aside from a few differences (Thor and Tony flying, opening up aerial combat a bit), everyone played kinda the same. Perhaps in a later part of the game some strategy comes into play, regarding abilities, but what was available in the demo (and it was pretty substantial) didn't really do it for me.

Overall i think it will be a pretty decent affair but it has a huge potential to end up like Anthem, if not handled properly.

Theres effectively no planning and it just feels like you have to mindlessly mash square and triangle, and spam circle (dodging in this feels sooo bad) whenever they wind up an attack.

- BY DAN STAPLETON Why is this a review in progress? Right now all of Watch Dogs 2’s “seamless multiplayer” modes, in which players can dynamically appear in each other’s games, are disabled because of major performance problems. Ubisoft is actively working to resolve them, but no firm date has been given for a fix. Until I’ve had a chance to play those modes and test them (or until two days after launch, whichever comes first) this review will remain in progress with a temporary score.

Still though, going by Gameinformer's quote - ""The narrative fails to match the impact John Marston or Niko Bellic's tales, but the colorful characters kept me interested in the story nonetheless"" - it still sounds like a blast, and might sedate those who complained about the lack of GTA IV's ""fun"" in that it eschews storyline seriousness in favour of brass-tacks playability and enjoyment.

That's not to say that it's not a valid criticism from the author's perspective.

1mi15z,Letharis,"While that's the major complaint of the review, it's not the only one. The reviewer also critiques the lack of openness in certain areas, like how only certain characters can invest in certain establishments and how various plot events show one character doing something for plot reasons when it would have made more sense for another character to be doing it and there's no way for you (the player) to change it.

But you are right that the biggest complaint by far of the reviewer is that the characters are evil, and in a psychopathic, no clear justification kind of way. I am very sympathetic to this criticism. 

Rockstar may have just built the game with the best ""open-worldness"" to date. There looks to be an absurd amount of opportunity for geographic exploration and enjoyable sidequests and everything looks great. It seems like, again, the toys are handed the the player and the player often gets to figure out what fun means, which is great. But this just looks to be not true when it comes to the main characters. There's nothing like ok here's some powerful persuasive ability we're giving your character, go interact with people, be a complete psycho if you want but you could also be normal or even righteous. In other parts of the game you do get options like this: here's this really powerful car/gun/airplane go do what you like with it to get fun how you want. But not when it comes to your character. Instead it looks like we're going to get: in order to advance the main story you will be an absolutely miserable asshole. The crimes you commit would be enough to get you thrown in the Hague. 

Also, how does this whole making your characters all varying shades of evil work with a game that seems to have (at least somewhat) funny, clever social commentary embedded into it as well. What message can be derived from a game world that lampoons network news, video game culture, privileges, etc. while forcing your characters to commit heinous acts for personal gain in order to advance the plot? Is it promotion of some sort of nihilism? I think that's unlikely. Surely Rockstar writers would have no problem satirizing that as well. In some ways it seems like the world that is being built is the world of South Park, a place filled with constant criticism of modern society, where instead of the traditional main characters, all of the protagonists are Cartman.

Here, I'll make it easy for you: 

>GTA V has little room for women except to portray them as strippers, prostitutes, long-suffering wives, humorless girlfriends and goofy, new-age feminists we’re meant to laugh at. 

>Characters constantly spout lines that glorify male sexuality while demeaning women, and the billboards and radio stations of the world reinforce this misogyny, with ads that equate manhood with sleek sports cars while encouraging women to purchase a fragrance that will make them “smell like a bitch.” Yes, these are exaggerations of misogynistic undercurrents in our own society, but not satirical ones. With nothing in the narrative to underscore how insane and wrong this is, all the game does is reinforce and celebrate sexism. The beauty of cruising in the sun-kissed Los Santos hills while listening to “Higher Love” by Steve Winwood turns sour really quick when a voice comes on the radio that talks about using a woman as a urinal. 

You don't have to agree with her opinion, but she does justify it in the text. And it still got a fucking 9/10. It's not like she gave it an 8.8.

Edit: To be clear, in my opinion, based only on my experience with previous GTA games, the misogyny in the game is likely there to act as an exaggerated mirror of its presence in the real world, and not because the developers are actually misogynistic themselves. But I haven't played it, so maybe the tone doesn't come off that way in this game, or maybe they never put a spotlight on it in such a way to make it actually appear as the subject of parody/farce and it just comes off as offensive.

Look at the Nintendo Directs. The man himself, humbled before his viewers, offering them the best thing his company can do: fun and entertaining videogames. Nothing more.

76ppyo,forknox,"Meltdown about Polygon reveiw in 3...2...1

Seriously though, he says it was not for him and reveiws are by definition subjective. 

He takes away points for gameplay too:

>The Fractured But Whole tracks progress of how many of these little navigation “puzzles” you’ve solved around town, but even using the term puzzle feels a bit like an overstatement. Within the first few hours of the game, I was familiar with the four or five different methods for solving any given puzzle


He also says stuff like this if you actually read the reveiw:

>The children of South Park may be foul-mouthed, but there’s a surprising wholesomeness to these moments. Moreover, many of the game’s side quests reveal more about the kids’ difficult personal battles.

Goes right in into SOTN/ARIA/DAWN and imho gameplay wise is better game than all of them.

I really really really love absolute humongous amount of skills and FF9 like weapon skill system. There is shiton of replay-ability here much more compared to previous classic games.

It really is fun to hunt for specific weapon to learn new weapon art to later use that art on other weapons of same type.

edit: 

Most fun feature - that weapons have low atk power andstrenght is much more important than atk power of weapon. Which means you can use for a long time interesting weapons which you would have to drop in previous classic games after 30 minutes to hour. Flying sword i used, i found it like in first 1/4 of game and it stayed with me whole game.

Interesting stuff:

- shitload of monster specific gear. Much like dark souls if you see dude with spinning sword there is huge change you can get that sword from mob.
- way more funny stuff and easter eggs than in SOTN. Shoes that squeek every time you set foot ? Glasses that makes you nearsighted ? etc etc.
- Game at start doesn't look that great but that changes once you get inside the castle which looks great.
- I am pretty sure there will be people doing SANIC speed runs due to certain skill. It is really really really fun to use it. This skill also works a lot like SANIC mechanics so you can bounce off from enemies heads damaging them. Gotta go fast mates.

c39tmn,HappierShibe,"This is all *super nitpicky,* but these are my thoughts.
I'm about 15 hours in on PC.  
It doesn't NEED further patches there, but it would benefit from them, and given how responsive they've been I'm sure it will get them.      
  
1. I've had one crash while leaving a save room, which is about as insignificant a crash as you can ask for. 1 crash in 15+ hours is not bad, I've played plenty of less stable console games.
  
2. There is an odd cosmetic issue regarding wall collisions in some places, where the walls aren't mapped accurately to the actual collisions. It has zero impact on gameplay, and honestly, I don't think anyone would notice if you didn't go around beating on the walls looking for secret passages from time to time, which highlights the issue.  This can surely be fixed, it's just going to take a boatload of manual collision tweaking for someone to go through and map *every single wall in the game by hand*.
  
3. Volume is not consistent. Some sound effects are way louder, than everything else. This *might* be a deliberate choice or reference since SotN did the same thing.  
  
4. There is some nconsistency in the lighting model. Again, this might be a deliberate choice rather than a bug, but the lighting of the environments does not always line up with the lighting of the character/enemy models.  I suspect they are doing this to ensure that their occasionally busy 2d playscape doesn't get washed-out/washed-in/rendered illegible by the environments.  
on one hand I figure there has to be a better way to tackle this... on the other I can't think of a good solution other than incredibly tedious manual tweaking of every single screen, and that would be such an immense undertaking that it might as well not even be an option, and it still wouldn't address problems with enemy recognition.    
  
5. Some enemies and NPC's could use another pass to bring them into line more consistently with the bulk of the game.  The visual style of the game is deliberately broad so that it can acommodate everything from shovel knight, to jojo poses, to not-alucard, without any of it feeling out of place -I think people are missing that context- but they could still use a bit more stylistic unity around the core cast, who I don't think need to worry about that broad arms-stretched-wide stylistic variety.  
  
6. Sometimes if you kill an ethereal enemy while they are inside a wall, the drop gets stuck in the wall.  
  
None of that NEEDS to be fixed, hell many of these 'bugs' are still in other castlevania games, but it would add some polish.",59,1561126316.0,/r/Games/comments/c39tmn/bloodstained_ritual_of_the_night_review_thread/

4k40t1,,"The Digitally Downloaded review was interesting to read. I disagree with a lot of his points, like saying that the modern Doom guy has less personality than the older Doom guy. I may be totally off the mark here since I'm just a few hours into the campaign, but the opening really set the mood and tapped into the old emotions of how I feel about the Doom marine. The demons are bad, but I am worse. They are animals that kill on instinct, but *I* am the Doom marine with a legacy, who calculatingly slaughters, efficiently and without mercy. I don't need to see his face because the opening has given me enough context in my imagination that I already project myself into the character. 

In response to his criticism about not having a blood fetish enough and kill animations are too short, I'm glad that the developers didn't sacrifice fluidity of combat for the sake of more gore porn. I'm fairly certain this came from enormous feedback from the community about not wanting gameplay to be halted during glory kills and they implemented that well.

The part where I can see his point more is when bodies disappear after a few seconds. It would've been cool to walk into a new area and then look over your shoulder at the end just to see the broken demon bodies you turned inside out with your shotgun. But I think even that was probably a conscious design decision from the developers who wanted to maintain the level of graphic fidelity and not lose performance over time.

Not to mention that the fetishization of violence that the original Doom had is way overblown. It was gory, for sure, but it never reveled in its violence. The Glory Kills in new Doom are a billion times more fetishistic and brutal than anything in the original games.

70uz6p,Cookie_Eater108,"I just completed this and have got to say the devs are doing a great job refining the formula and it culminates in Death of the Outsider. 

At first, hearing you only have 3 powers (Where one of them is your blink/far reach power) had me worried that this would be Dishonored lite but the powers they give you have such great utility that I found myself using them in new creative ways. 

The level design is well done and keeps to the dishonored experience well, overall, if you enjoyed DH1 and 2 then you're getting a more refined version in DOTO. 

My only 3 complaints: 

- All of the powers Billie has are stealth-oriented meaning that you get very little utility from a high chaos run. 

- The game doesn't appear to care if you do high or low chaos, there's no bearing on the ending at all. 

- Maybe just me, but in the final mission, there's an enemy that can't be knocked out, is difficult to fight and seems to spot you almost instantly. The game doesn't do a great introduction for them either to really showcase those things so dealing with them is largely trial, error and a lot of quick saves and quick loads.

You can use it like a standard teleport to get around, but it also has the option to be used with Foresight to get around walls or to set up combo kills, etc. Semblance is a lot like Possession but it lends itself a lot better to interesting story moments if you're pretending to be the right person.

hwh45f,Captain_Moscow,"Aright, semi long rant from a pretty big Xbox supporter.

Absolutely nothing wowed me. SO MANY small indie games, which is fine, but not what I'm going to buy a console for. There are already thousands of great indie games coming out on PC. I saw absolutely nothing to compete with Sony's exclusives, which sucks. Absolutely nothing looked on the same scope as Uncharted, God of War, Spider-Man, Tsushima, or Horizon. 

Halo looked... fine? That could have been a remaster. The obvious retort is that we shouldn't judge based on a short teaser, but when that's all they show I have no choice. Infinite was supposed to be the grand return to form for the franchise and it looks like a deleted level from Halo 5. The only differences were a more open map, which was barely shown, and a grapling hook, which wasn't shown doing anything terribly interesting. The shield? That's just a smaller version of the bubble shield we've had before. Like, more of a good thing is fine, but this is what you're anchoring your entire consoles exclusive line up with? Again, I might get more excited as we learn more, but, if so, the marketing team did a terrible job using this clip to generate hype for a new console.

The most promising games were barely teasers. I don't understand having this big event right now if yo I have no big games with actual gameplay to show. STALKER, Avowed, and the Warhammer game look cool...maybe? I can't tell because all I saw were cgi cutscenes. I'll give credit to Medium for looking pretty dope. The sibling and Southwest painted ones, the names of which escape me, seem cool too but there wasn't enough to judge on.

Ending with a short CGI thing for Fable that told us absolute nothing beyond ""it exists,"" which we already knew, was incredibly anticlimactic. Can we at least get something that tells us why we should be excited? What's new about it? That belonged somewhere in the middle, but I'm lost about what could have filled it spot at the end. Nothing they showed was an ""oh shit"" exclamation mark. 

I really want to want a series X, but as of right now I've seen zero reason to be excited. And that sucks. How do you own this many developers and not put together flagship IPs?

26l57g,the_unusual_suspect,"Just beat the story.

This is going to be quick, and I'm not really good at this, so I apologize in advance (no real spoilers if I can help it).

The story:

It's... convoluted, to the point that certain ideas and characters are introduced for almost no reason, and that if they were excluded it wouldn't hurt the overall plot. The ending was... I don't know... silly? The game takes itself way too seriously, to the point that at the end I felt like it had become a parody of itself. Right up until that point, I was okay with it, and really liked certain parts. Then they kind of ruined it with quite honestly, a really bad piece of dialogue, followed by a SURPRISE right at the end, that only exists to contribute to a sequel. That on top of the constant tastes of other underlying plots that could have been explored, but are being saved for the sequel annoyed me.

Audio:

Guns sounds kind of eh... nothing special. The heavy machine gun is especially weak sounding.

Cars are another exceptionally weak point.

The soundtrack outside of the radio is sometimes really really good. And serves to increase tension quite well during certain portions of the game.

Voice work can be hit or miss. Some lines of dialogue aren't that great, and can be delivered poorly because of it. Biggest problem I have is that Aiden expresses almost no fucking emotion when he needs to. There's some seriously bad shit that happens, and he does monotone monologues. It sucks -- it isn't compelling. In other situations Aiden emotes quite well, when given something to work with. But the monologueing shouldn't have been used so much. I'm not an idiot, I don't need constant exposition.

Gameplay:

Lets start with the hacking. It's not explored enough. Outside of the systems you can use to distract, or kill enemies with, there is a very simple hacking game you'll come across many, many times throughout the game. The problem is it never changes, and it slows the action down way too much.

The gunplay is your typical cover based system, similar to well... what you're already used to. Nothing really innovating here. So I'm not going to write too much about it.

There are definitely multiple way to reach an objective, more or less (at least the infiltration portions), and it can be pretty interesting. But it will more or less come down to infiltrating cameras, and using that to dispose of or distract enemies while you make your entrance. I won't say it's not fun, but some times it get tedious literally doing the same thing over again (get into cameras, blow up enemies, go in). I think the problem stems from not enough variety in the environment. You'll see all the different exploitable objects you can use to your advantage very quickly.

There's also a severe lack of story mission variety. They introduce a couple different types, but then they throw in two types of escort style missions. First one being the familiar type: Guard this person, don't let them die. The second type being: Guide this person by hacking into cameras and moving them into cover. Unfortunately this is massively hampered by the cover system, to the point of frustration. Trust me when I say you're going to be doing these over several times.

As for Aiden's overall movement, I feel like it's sluggish, but then I've felt the same way about Assassins Creed, and this borrows heavily from that.

Now let me talk about driving. Handling is bad -- really bad. You get used to it, but that doesn't make it any less bad. That said, chases can be pretty damn fun. The different objects you can use to block your chasers, or wreck them, can be pretty fun. But it's often hampered by the poor handling of your ride. Often times if I'm chasing someone that I don't have to leave alive, it usually goes as follows, simply because of the annoyance I have with the car handling. Chase bad guy, block his car with mine by simply driving in front of him and stopping. Get out, and shoot him with my gun. I wish it weren't that way, but if they wanted driving to be such a big part of the game, the handling shouldn't have been so shit.

I'm not going to talk about side missions simply because it's boring, and  entirely pointless -- seriously. They're just small editions of story missions you've already played. And they're all the same after you've done one. Sure it's a different location, and your entry may be different, but they all work off the same premise. The exact problem assassins creed suffered from.

Oh yea, the ""vigilante"" system, or whatever you want to call it, doesn't seem to serve a purpose. Basically you get rep with the citizens, but I don't know if it affected a single thing. And I don't like that. A game mechanic that effectively did nothing. Maybe I missed something, but if it isn't readily apparent, then it was implemented poorly in my opinion.

Now, did I enjoy it? Yes, there were certain things I really liked. Infiltrating a compound without ever being seen can be a joy. Escaping the police or fixers hot on your tail can be absolutely fantastic (when it works right -- there seems to be a problem during certain missions that if you die while trying to escape it doesn't reset right, and when you load up again, you can just drive away, not an enemy in sight). And some absolutely fantastic plot developments (which get kind of ruined). That said I don't think I'll be playing it again.",66,1401177834.0,/r/Games/comments/26l57g/watch_dogs_review_thread/

26l57g,Psychotrip,"I made a large ""first impressions"" post a few days ago in another thread which was based on a huge amount of livestreams I watched. After playing it, it seems my impressions were correct for the most part. My only main issue is that the driving is a bit off. I know some of you guys have seen this, but I think it's worth showing again since now I've played the games hands on.  Here's what I wrote before:


I know there's been a lot of hate for this game lately, but there's a few things that really stick out for me that seem to really set it apart from other games, for better or worse. I've noticed several things:


-There game world is very dense. It reminds me of Red Dead Redemption, where there's always something going on and something to see. Random encounters are varied and can be freely ignored.


-The game seems incredibly immersive. As someone who always finds a way to roleplay in video games, and takes his time taking in the ambience atmosphere, this game seems like a dream come true. The npcs always seem to have their own simulated lives, they argue over the phone, you can view their text messages, they behave in accordance with their profile (one guard was an ""aspiring porn star"", and actually got distracted by a porn director texting him that he ""got the job""). There's also something eerie about the people that makes terrorizing them, something that seems natural in grand theft auto, a bit more cringe-inducing. I dont know what it is or whether or not it's a good thing, but I feel sort of disturbed when I see them getting shot at, or calling the police, or getting run over, or getting blown up. I guess it's a sense of empathy I haven't felt in a video game before.


-There are multiple ways to complete almost every task. I loved GTA, RDR, and Sleeping Dogs, but all three of these games had very linear quest-structures. You go into a room and kill a bunch of guys, or chase them in a car. This game seems to have a very heavy emphasis on stealth and setting traps through hacking, but you can bypass enemies altogether, or finish an entire mission without killing anyone. Or you can go in guns blazing, though this is often lethal. I've also seen instances where players never physically engage, but hack their way through an entire mission.


-As stated earlier, the game seems to be very stealth-focused. It's NOT like grand theft auto, RDR, or Sleeping Dogs where you're encouraged to run and gun or just hide behind cover and pick off enemies. Enemies will flank you, surround you, call in reinforcements if they catch you, and wont just stay behind cover waiting for you to pick them off. If you stay behind cover for too long and they outnumber you, they'll come out of cover and surround you. This adds realism, but also makes the game much harder if you're not a stealth-player.


-The hacking is much more important than it initially seems. There seems to be a big focus in this game on technological-based distraction and sabatogue. Blowing up a power generator, setting off someone else's grenade, or simply fiddling with appliances to confuse guards. It's easy to think you can complete missions like you would in a Rockstar game: running in and shooting things like a badass, but that typically doesn't work very well in this game. Planning, patience, and strategy seems to be a requirement, and the learning curve seems to get higher as the game goes on.


All in all, I think this game is different from the typical sandbox crime thriller, with an emphasis of stealth and sabatogue rather than running and gunning. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is up to the player.",88,1401175413.0,/r/Games/comments/26l57g/watch_dogs_review_thread/

26l57g,eggies,"> Am I the only one that thinks all the quotes make it sound like a game deserving a lower score than it actually receives?

I think it breaks down to this: people want to play in the Holodeck. And when a game is first announced, it always seems like it's going to be a bit more like the Holodeck than the games that came before. The world is going to feel more organic, we think. NPCs will react to us more realistically. The narrative will be less predictable and reflect the way we interact with it more convincingly.

Upon initial reveal, Watch Dogs looked like the most Holodeck-like game to come out in, like, ever.

Of course, making a fully organic world with convincing NPCs who react to you in the same way that real people would is the sort of thing that would require vastly more sophisticated artificial intelligence than we've been able to cook up thus far. And so Watch Dogs comes out, and it's just another open world game with the same old tried and true mechanics that all of the other open world games have, modulo some interesting hacking flavor layered over the explosions.

You can't say it's a bad game, because it sounds like it's well made, for what it is. But it also isn't a magical alternate universe that you can step into and thoroughly believe in. It breaks the kind of implicit ""this time, the Holodeck!"" promise that the PR folks always make and we always hope for, just like every other game that was supposed to be the actual realization of the Holodeck. And so the reviewers can't help but be a little disappointed, despite the game being basically solid.

Now, on to hoping that Dragon Age: Inquisition is the final, actual, realization of the Holodeck! (At least in some small way that will help us not be disappointed :-) )",81,1401198743.0,/r/Games/comments/26l57g/watch_dogs_review_thread/

26l57g,fishingcat,"Having owned the game since Friday, and played probably around half of it, these reviews are exactly in line with what I expected (when asked yesterday I predicted a review score of 8.6 from IGN).

The game is fundamentally solid enough. Driving is decent, shooting is good, the world is interesting enough, and there's a substantial amount of content.

The problem is that it refuses to try and be at all adventurous with any of the ideas or mechanics it utilizes and ultimately ends up feeling a little empty and repetitive. The writing is predictably weak, the mission design falls into the same tropes as many other open world games and the hacking is underdeveloped.  

The end result is a game that's a broadly enjoyable experience, marred by a lack of vision or willingness to go beyond standard genre tropes. The E3 2012 demo was never going to fully representative of the final product, but the fact that it failed to produce any of that dynamic and emergent looking gameplay leaves one wondering what could have been, had the dev team dared to be original. 

While almost everything I just said was negative, Watch Dogs is't a bad game. There's nothing game ruining in it, and if you go in with your eyes open there's a lot of fun to be had here in a traditional open world /third person shooter experience. With the way videogames tend to be reviewed right now that works out to a solid 8-9 out of 10 from most major publications.

**TL;DR:** Watch Dogs is rather derivative and stale, but there isn't any aspect of it that's outright bad. Combine that with a ton of content, and you're looking at review scores of 7-9.",176,1401180832.0,/r/Games/comments/26l57g/watch_dogs_review_thread/

I didn't find that true at all. ""Hacking"" is just activating traps from a distance and the content is constantly repeated and pretty boring past the 10 hour mark, something it shares with the AC series.

It could potentially a be good series, with solid titles that maybe go into the 9's in scores but I don't see it spawning a masterpiece. Since it's worked on by many studios separated geographically it lacks the cohesiveness that makes it more than the sum of its parts.

7ahag7,,"Since everyone seems to be reviewing COD multiplayer, I'll give my stab at a quick campaign review.

Sledgehammer drew a lot of inspiration from Band of Brothers for the way the story develops, and I love that. There's no more taking a couple bullets and resting to regenerate HP, but relying on consumable first aid kits which seem to stack up to 4, giving about 1/3 to 1/2 of your HP back, I  can't recall which it is.

So far it seems to encourage taking action and being a part of the firefight whereas in previous COD campaigns you could merely advance forward and your AI squad will take care of everything so long as you were physically past a certain location. By killing enemies, certain familiar squad members will have their morale meter boosted and each can perform a function that'll benefit you; it could be tossing you ammo, first aid (e.g. Elizabeth in BioShock Infinite) or spotting enemies with their binoculars which will highlight them for you to see.

Overall, I'm having a blast with the campaign. Sure, it's *another WW2 game*, but there's enough variety from games like Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and the older Battlefield games to at the very least give it a fair shake. The game looks fantastic and as a COD game always ends up being greatly optimized on PC, so it's a nice bonus.",224,1509695694.0,/r/Games/comments/7ahag7/call_of_duty_wwii_review_thread/

High quality dedicated servers, 3 kill streaks that didn't even do much, less but more balanced guns, less but more balanced attachments, extremely good map design, completely unlocked config files which allowed you to customize your client exactly the way you wanted. FoV, FPS limit, turn on and off specific graphical settings, customize your UI (icon sizes, font colors etc), optimization was absolutely top notch (easy 300 fps with mediocre PC) and zero, absolutely *zero* goddamn input lag which meant that aiming and controlling your movement was as smooth as it possibly could be, which is perhaps the most critical and most important thing in a multiplayer FPS game.

CoD 4 is, and will probably forever be, the greatest multiplayer game I will ever play or see. Objectively and subjectively.

MW2 made a U-turn and fucked *everything* up except the campaign. Extremely shitty P2P servers, fuck ton of unbalanced weapons and other items, same for kill streaks, map design wasn't the worst at this point but it wasn't nearly as good as CoD 4's, every config file was locked because fuck client configuration. Locked 91 fps and locked FoV are great right. At first it was possible to hack both but later you could only hack the FoV. If you wanted a mediocre experience you had to hack the game.

Most people have that one massive game related disappointment and CoD is mine.

Then in like the next mission you're back to slaughtering Hun in your Landship. And then in the Italian mission you play as a Space Marine who carries around a heavy machine gun and mows down a bunch of Austrians. 

IMO, for all the bells and whistles the first mission had, BF1 still just shat on any deeper meaning that the game could have had, and just went for a COD-like pseudo-authenticity.

The closest thing I can guess is he's just NOT GOOD at certain games. I have played a LOT of shooters in my time, more hours than I'd care to admit, but if you slapped a controller in my hand and asked me to play CoD, I'd play it like a 4 year old. I've never played any shooters on console.

My nephew has an Xbox, and asked if I wanted to play CoD: Advanced Warfare. I said sure! And it was a cause for celebration when I got my first kill after 15 mins. I almost feel like I've played more hours of video games than he's been alive, but I was just plain embarrassingly awful.

d1r7zu,Professor_Snarf,"To understand why people are excited for this game, you have to understand the state of ""Loot games"" since Borderlands 2 came out and what exactly a loot game is.

A loot game to me is about doing the same content over and over to get loot to proceed doing the same content over and over at a harder difficulty. A few rules:

* The loot gets progressively better and more interesting, your character looks cooler and more impressive, and you are always on the hunt for a piece of loot that enables your character to be optimized or respeced into another play style. **You are constantly rewarded**

* The loot is ""earned"" though gameplay, not MTX stores. **The loot is inside a ""lootbox"", but you are not paying real money to get it.**

* Cosmetics ARE loot, and part of the thrill of **getting cosmetic loot is inherent to the game.**

* The core loop of the game is fun at hour 1 and at hour 200, and is incredibly simple.

* You can play 4 hours a week or 60 hours a week, **the only thing gating your progress is the time you put in.**

Diablo 1,2 & 3 are a great loot games, Torchlight 2, and so is Borderlands 2. Hell, Phantasy Star Online was a fantastic loot game 20 years ago.

What has happened since BL2 is the games that want to be loot games have removed one or more of those rules and ruined the experience in the process.

Path of Exile, which is awesome but is also free to play, which means certain pieces of loot are only obtainable though MTX, removing those rewards from gameplay. So if you want to look cool, you have to pay up. It's also incredibly complex to discern the systems at play.

Destiny has great core gameplay, but there isn't enough loot, a lot of the cosmetics are behind paywalls (which is an issue when the loot pool is already slim), and there are constant progress gates placed in your way.

Anthem has a ton of issues, limited loot pool, cosmetic loot being placed not only in an MTX store but a rotating MTX store on top of that, and pretty bad core gameplay.

Warframe, which I love btw, is another example of a looter time gating progression. Again, I understand why as it's a free to play game, but it's not as fun as Diablo or BL2 imo.

So with Borderlands 3, it's the promise of a loot game that follows all of the above rules. You can play as much as you want, be constantly surprised and rewarded with not only gear but also cosmetics, with interesting core gameplay loop. And I can't wait.

There is alpha gameplay available on YT if you want to see what an older build of the game looks like (e.g., [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmVk76JTQsQ)).

Its also important to know that **this is an indie game**. It was first backed on Kickstarter. It was originally going to be split into two parts with the first part releasing in 2018, but the devs managed to get an investment that let them complete and ship the game as a full experience.

Titanfall worked with a lot of bhopping and aerial parkor because everything was based on it. The weapons had variety and can function at various different levels of boost and running.

The SMG can allow you to do high speed hit and run, but is largely useless in range. The rifle can let you take well aimed shot but becomes almost useless if you go at speed, then you have just more scales of speed and aim.

And if all else fails, titans can be called down to play anti-inf, while other titans can be anti-titan.

It is far more nuanced in that way, but all AW did was copy the lots of bunny hopping without the modification to anything else. Including the infantry focus. ",66,1446807815.0,/r/Games/comments/3rq6v8/call_of_duty_black_ops_3_review_thread/

**The Jimquisition**

*Yooka-Laylee is a game out of time, clinging so desperately to past glories it doesn’t seem to understand the Earth kept spinning after the N64 was discontinued. It’s everything wrong about the formative years of 3D platforming and it somehow retained none of what made the genre’s highlights endure...Yooka-Laylee is, in a word, rubbish.*

**2**

-----

**VideoGamer**

*Yooka-Laylee would fit right into the late 90s with its vague puzzles, wakka-wakka voices, and confusing levels. Time has moved on since the N64, and while there are a handful of bright spots, this sadly isn't the catalyst for a 3D platformer revival.*

**4**


-----

**IBTimes UK**

*It's difficult to recommend Yooka-Layee to adults let alone the children this game is aimed at. The unbalanced challenge it presents and the lack of in-game direction is sure to infuriate. You could argue kids of this generation could play the game alongside a YouTube video for help, but why should any game need to be played alongside a video guide? The first three-hours of Yooka-Layee are delightful, but after that the experience quickly sours. Playtonic's ode to platformers past should have been something special, but instead it's a reminder why video games have evolved, and why quality over quantity should be the first decree in every developer's rulebook.*

**Gamer.nl**

*Yooka-Laylee tries to be nostalgic, but never really gets to the level of the good old platform games from before. Levels are full of technical difficulties and tend to get boring quickly.*

**5**

**Eurogamer Italy**

*A heartfelt homage to Banjo-Kazooie, lacking the grace, technical mastery and playability that made the original a classic.*

**5**

-----

**Playstation Universe**

*Yooka-Laylee shows there’s room for nostalgia-flavored 3D platforming in today’s market by reminding us of the joys of well-built, colorful worlds, and daft, fun characters. Unfortunately, the good work put in by Playtonic to modernise the stagnant genre is hamstrung by glaring technical issues that dull the vibrancy, and cloud over your enjoyment.*

**6**

-----

**InsideGamer.nl**

*Yooka-Laylee feels like an old Rare platformer, including many cool challenges, funny characters and colorful audiovisual design. The design of the levels, though, is a big let down. They are so frustrating that Yooka-Laylee is best played in short sessions.*

**6**

-----

**Critical Hit**

*Yooka-Laylee is a nostalgic trip to the past that ignores all the innovations that came after it. There's an appeal to return to a bygone era of platforming, but it's quickly washed away with long stretches of tedious, boring gameplay, and a sense of wit that thinks it's far smarter than it really is.*

**6**

-----

**TheSixthAxis**

*Of all the potential hurdles to snag on in creating a 3D platformers in the style of the late nineties classics, Playtonic deftly avoids the most egregious ones by far. At its very core, Yooka-Laylee succeeds in reviving a format long forgotten and does so with such vigor and passion. However, players shouldn’t expect it to reinvent the genre.*

**7**

-----

A lot of the his complaints were so poorly explained that people could go from saying he outright ignored some mechanics to saying that he meant something completely different.

The shrine thing is the best example. He said, in so many words, that the shrines were basically untrackable (as in, you have no way of knowing if you did them) after you visited them for the first time. People who argued this score was made up before he played the game stated that the game actually marks it as not done. However, people who were very much on his side would argue that he meant it in a momentum kind of way (as in, you wouldn't want to go back after it is visited the first time.)

As I said early, a lot of the backlash came from him having a poor argument in those people's eyes, and saying he would probably be the one to give it the exact score he gave it and ""Zelda fans would shit their diapers."" And then, after a short turn around, he did a Jimquisition on the backlash he had initially predicted on a Podquisition before he got the game for review.

But you have to keep in mind a game like Breath of the Wild isn't cheap to make. They did an absolutely insane amount of work, and testing, for that game. Having the entire dev team play through the game to check for bugs and such is not a luxury most companies have. Hell, I think it's a luxury only Nintendo has. 

Fighting games aren't easy to make because of balance and game feel, very easy to fuck up either when developing a fighter. On top of that, you have to determine ""is this going to be like Smash 4 or Melee?"" AND on top of that most game companies don't really have a character pool to pull from like Nintendo does. Part of the appeal of Smash has always been all the characters from different franchises fighting each other. Sony is the only company that can really come close, and look how that turned out.

Note: This comment isn't directed at you, specifically, since even you say that sometimes Jim takes his scores too far.

That said, I don't like it when this is trotted out; this idea that only the negative opinions are the ones telling ""the truth"" or ""saying what everyone is really thinking"". It happens over and over. If someone spews unnecessary amounts of praise on something they are a ""fanboy shill"", but if they are ridiculously negative they are the only one ""telling it like it is"".

Both extremes are annoying, but they are both telling their subjective experience of the game. However, because gaming is an expensive medium in both money *and* time. Many of us seek out opinions that not only validate our purchases, but also validate what we chose *not to purchase*.

*However*, what I can not stand when it comes to **any** review is when the reviewer tends to treat their *subjective* likes and dislikes when it comes to game design as the basis for what is *objectively* good or bad design. This is where my distaste for Jim's reviews come from. I don't care if he rates it a 2/10 because he didn't like it, but he frames it in such a way that he is the sole proprietor of what makes a good or bad game, which is what leads to his audience claiming Jim is the only one telling ""the truth"". Now, he has many times waived this criticism away with ""jokes"" that ""because this is clearly my opinion, I'm going to assume now that this is absolute fact because, lol."" But you don't get to do that and then proceed to bask in the glory of ""knowing"" what is good or bad design, but cry foul when, while peddling in high emotion content you receive an equally emotional response when you are called out.

-------------------------------

**TL;DR** - Jim doesn't speak ""truth"", he just has a specific opinion on how he likes his games and reviews games solely on his criteria as if it is standard.

""Whether in stealth or in combat, the enemy AI isn’t up to standards set by other shooters, likely due to moving outside the confines of the Metro. While sneaking around you’ll find that anything but standing directly in their line-of-sight, in good lighting will go unnoticed, even on higher difficulty settings. Once they do spot you, combat involves them firing shots that alternate between sniper and Storm Trooper level accuracy. Their tactics mostly involve either standing around, or getting slightly behind cover and popping off shots. Animals and other non-humans don’t fare much better, simply looking confused or charging you wildly, exposing further issues with the slow combat system. There’s no real strategy involved in the firefights, and if things get too bad, your best bet is to usually just run away, often leading to the next objective trigger which will eliminate the impending threat.""",92,1550074438.0,/r/Games/comments/aq7eff/metro_exodus_review_thread/

Steel can be used to unlock cosmetic options, but many such options are also locked behind progression. So it's not like there isn't stuff to unlock by just playing.

As well, while you can buy crates for randomized gear with Steel, all players should be discouraged from doing so as your gear quality is gated behind your level.

Further, you do get a new piece of gear (and steel) after nearly every match. I play very casually, little time to do so due to work and social obligations, and I have felt zero pressure to buy any steel.

3y23he,RikuKat,"I knew him very well. He was one of my closest friends. 

Many of his friends gathered at his favorite bar last night to mourne his passing and celebrate his life. We had actually discussed this kind of event before and he declared he wanted everyone to celebrate him when he passed.

He was a wonderful man. He an extremely intelligent programmer and game developer. The first game he made was some 17 years ago, before prebuilt engines were available. He made every lick of it himself, from the art to graphics rendering. He liked to chuckle about how in his first interview, they asked him what parts of the game he made and he responded ""I don't understand the question"" because he made them all. 

Before he made that video game, he was a mechanical engineer. I came from the same background in ME and we bonded over our engineering to self taught game developer path. 

He had a bright green mohawk (though it was often faded, as he usually didn't dye it frequently) and was very passionate about the Sounders. He loved the Seahawks as well and enjoyed martial arts. 

He was a self declared ""asshole"" and was blunt and straightforward. You always knew what he was thinking and what he thought of you. However, his bluntness and tendency to flip off cameras couldn't hide the fact that he was a very kind, passionate, caring person. He went out of his way to make people feel accepted and he brought together a huge group of people that would not have known each other without him. He put his friends before everything else and you always knew he had your back. 

He was a mentor to many, both inside and outside of games. Whenever I needed advice, he'd happily take me to the side and spend hours helping me figure things out. He gave me advice on life, my career in the industry, and even on relationships. 

He had taken many people under his wing and his passing will be felt throughout the game industry. Our industry is rather small and he had left impressions on many of us. We have lost a wonderful man.

I'm frankly baffled about the whole ""you can only change your loadout at the forge"" decision. Trying out the loot you find is a huge part of the genre's appeal and having to sit through multiple loadscreens to do so is just insanity on the part of the designers.

ataqla,RareBk,"I absolutely have a need for a postmortem. Just playing the game makes it evident that you're playing some bizarro version of another game, one that didn't have anything to do with looter shooter stuff.

There are about four 'unique' models per type of gun, and all of them are bordering on identical, both visually and functionality. It is also one of the blandest sets of weapons in a fantasy technology ultra future setting, where these people have been using these suits since antiquity. 

There is no way they didn't have plans for a ton of unique weapons, but had to cut down to the most barebone, generic, uninteresting content possible. Like there is no way you purposely design the SPECIAL versions of weapons to be literally just the same four guns painted red or blue. They don't even have unique models!?

Then there's **the Fort.**

oh boy. The fort. Tarsis is a mess. It's huge for how slow you move, completely empty, and just... useless. You have bounty boards that you don't really get to use much, NPCs with dialogue that should link up to quests that just don't exist (There are multiple NPCs referring to similar things and you should be able to point them towards one another because they solve each other's issues... but you can't. Like these NPCs are useless and you don't ever have any even reason to talk to them... but they have dialogue trees about this stuff.) There are two stores in the main area that are identical, and do nothing but link to the microtransaction store. Both do this. They're right next to each other. One of them doesn't even have any dialogue.

Speaking of MTX, a quarter of the main menu's tabs is dedicated to the microtransaction slot. Just smack dab there. In the middle. Unavoidable. And empty. Like legitimately empty, there's maybe a handful of javelin parts and a sticker? For a game that is intended to be funded by players buying cosmetics, there aren't any. At all. 

Then there's the matchmaking. Oh lord, it doesn't work. Quick play is broken, but I'm not entirely sure it is the matchmaking itself, or if the missions that I'm filling slots for are just... empty because players have left. Why? Because every single time I hit quickplay, I joined a mission that was broken. Every single time. I would join in and there would be no objective, or the enemies wouldn't be spawning, or I was SPAWNING IN A BROKEN VERSION OF THE FINAL BOSS LAIR. (This last bit happened four times. I was level 10.) It was a 100% failure rate.

It wasn't even like the writing was good, they projected a twist about a character from immediately after the prologue, and when it happens, you go ""Yeah, of course"" and move on because you don't care. There isn't a single character to care about, the only one that I found myself even remotely endeared to was the Sentinel girl who is basically having an anxiety attack every time she talks to you.

2lzbfp,Daveed84,"I posted this in another thread but I figure some folks might find it helpful here. Seems like my thoughts are in line with some of the other reviews.


The game is a buggy mess, from texture pop-in to characters walking through each other (even in cutscenes!) to the game outright freezing for seconds at a time at random intervals on my PC. There's even some chests in the game that I can't open because Ubisoft is having server problems (wtf???).

Then there's the unlock system, where you spend points to get skills that in previous games you either had from the start or unlocked through story progression. And you get ""Creed Points"" (I'm not making this up) for completing ""Assassin"" actions, like using one of those lift things that propel you to the top of buildings when you walk/run into them. You actually get an on-screen notification each time you do this, and you rank up as you complete more and more actions. Also, there's not just Creed Points, but something like 2 or 3 other kinds of points as well which I don't fully understand yet. You can outright buy items, or ""hack"" them, not sure what that is as it hasn't been explained to me yet, but you spend hack points or something to hack... It's all really weird.

It's a damn shame, and I hope they iron out these issues quickly, because the game is otherwise really fun and beautiful and I'm enjoying it despite the problems.

UPDATE: Just wanted to mention that during one of the freezes today, the game actually crashed. During another, it disconnected me from my friends during co-op play. At another point during co-op play, the game slowed to a crawl -- ~5 FPS. It wasn't caused by any particular on-screen event, just totally random. This was only fixed by restarting the game.",333,1415726417.0,/r/Games/comments/2lzbfp/assassins_creed_unity_review_thread/

2lzbfp,DislikesUSGovernment,"I have played the game for about 3-4 hours since its release last night and here are my thoughts:

I am running the game on an i7 3770k with a GTX780 SC on high settings.

The game is fucking gorgeous and so far Arno is a very like able character although very similar to Ezio. Paris looks much more realistic than any city we have seen in past AC games and it is massive.

That being said, the game is a fucking mess. It feels like an essay that a student waited until the night before to turn in. It has all the makings of greatness, but it doesn't quite come together in the end. I feel like ubisoft really just bit off more than they can chew with this one. Some of the things like the insane pop in textures, Notre Dame looking muddy not 300 yards away because it is past the render distance, and what feels like a clunky free running system (despite their attempt to make it more fluid), just really distract from what has the potential to be a great game.

As far as performance goes, on PC with my specs, it isn't bad. I got Watchdogs on PC and it was a huge mistake. Even on high (as opposed to ultra) settings the game was unplayable, and I did not believe the visuals I was seeing justified the performance hit. With Assassin's Creed I do see the how the visuals cause the performance hits and it makes them a bit more justified considering that the framerate doesn't dip below tolerable levels, however this is just my experience.

The final thing I will say about this game, and it made me fucking sick to my stomach when I saw this, was micro transactions in the fucking single player campaign. You can upgrade your gear with ""Helix points"" that can be purchased with real money. To even attempt to spend the resources on something inside a 60 dollar AAA game, let alone one that feels as buggy and unfinished as this one, is just disappointing and really was the last straw for me. **I will not purchase another ubisoft game until these are removed** and I have been a loyal customer of theirs for many years as I immensely enjoy their games.

My final thoughts are that at the end of the day the game is good but it feels rushed. It lacks any form of polish and I really think ubisoft should have taken an extra year to work out the kinks and prioritize the features they implemented in the game as I think that a few (namely the heavy crowds) were not worth the resources to develop nor to render on the screen. If you are a die hard ubi/AC fan I would get this game if you really want to, but I honestly can't with a good conscience recommend it with the micro transactions. If you don't fall into the aforementioned category, hold off or withhold your purchase from this game altogether. ",168,1415728487.0,/r/Games/comments/2lzbfp/assassins_creed_unity_review_thread/
2lzbfp,merkwerk,"From the Joystiq review. 

**Another Joystiq editor, playing on PS4, encountered similar bugs. On Xbox One however, these issues were exacerbated by a framerate with less structural integrity than the crumbling roofs of Paris. Whether I ran through the crowded streets or shambled along the rooftops, noticeable drops in framerate almost constantly distracted from the experience.** 
http://www.joystiq.com/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review-a-tale-of-two-games/

In line with what a lot of us have been experiencing across all platforms. Really disappointed as I'm a huge AC fan. I can honestly say this is the first AC I personally regret purchasing. 


From Kotaku: 

**The graphics are astounding. They are not without technical problems... some pop-in, some chuggy framerates that will bother you if you have a low tolerance for that sort of thing (my game crashed on my Xbox One three times over the past several days, but Unity has also been patched a bunch already, so it's hard to tell how long-term these issues are). I was nevertheless happy with the game's performance, all things considered and what with the series' historical emphasis on visual detail and strong art direction over smooth, high-framerate performance.**


Gamesradar:

**A few other AC bugs linger; you can be spotted behind cover, enemies will either forget you in an instant or continue to hunt you from afar, and the game’s desperate insistence to not let you interact with mission objectives while your conflict indicator is high is infuriatingly last-generation design. ""I’m here,"" you scream, ""isn’t that enough?"" It’s worth saying too that frame-rate wise, I experienced things slowing down occasionally through busy scenes, in both review and retail copies. Another unwelcome AC hallmark returning to plague the new generation.**


Polygon:

**Assassin's Creed Unity buckles in other ways, making for the least stable, worst-performing major release I've played this year. Its moment-to-moment performance varies between acceptable and abysmal, falling toward the latter entirely too often with a framerate I'd ballpark in the teens somewhere or, rarely, the single digits. Worse, I experience a number of hard crashes on the Xbox One version provided for review, and I fell through the ground into formless oblivion seven or eight times in my 20ish hours with the game. Load times are also prohibitively long, often taking a minute or more.**

Eurogamer:

**Unity suffers from some glaring performance issues, particularly on PlayStation 4, with frame-rates regularly taking a tumble in the same way they did in previous games.**",169,1415725973.0,/r/Games/comments/2lzbfp/assassins_creed_unity_review_thread/

Then *Cyberpunk* came along.

This is the greatest game I have ever played. Every single element of this game has been carefully constructed towards perfection. The graphics are unbelievable, the music is phenomenal, the story could rival the greatest masterpieces ever written all the way back to the debut of *Gilgamesh*, and the gameplay...well, let me just say that the Witcher 3 has finally been dethroned as the game that every person totally and obviously recognizes was the GOAT. Nothing can compete with taking down corporate goons with top-level hacks, summoning a lightning bolt to level a skyscraper, and wearing a clever David Hasselhoff mask to pass by security checks. And who can forget the emotional denouement when you finally discover who your real uncle is on your deathbed?? (Sorry for spoilers!)

And the best part about *Cyberpunk*? The game tailors itself to exactly what I desire! I had an awesome romp through a thrilling action-RPG, but my best friend got an excellent platformer! Someone else got the perfect kart racer! And another guy got the fantasy/sci-fi football manager he had always longed for!

Truly, this game is going to be the hallmark for all games - nay, all media to succeed it. I can't wait for the movie, the novel, the T-shirt, the Pogs, and of course, the tabletop RPG that will be based on this game. I love *Cyberpunk 2077*, and it loves me.

So, I cordially invite you all to the wedding next spring!",68,1522587977.0,/r/Games/comments/88qf0e/cyberpunk_2o77_review_thread/

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.",84,1522603482.0,/r/Games/comments/88qf0e/cyberpunk_2o77_review_thread/

88qf0e,KULAKS_DESERVED_IT,"What is Berlin? Berlin, as a city, brings nothing but shame to Germany on the international stage. When comparing Berlin with other European capitals such as London, Paris, Madrid and Amsterdam, any decent human’s face must blush in humiliation. Even small countries like Austria, Belgium or Switzerland have Vienna, Brussels and Zurich: presentable cities, complete with high standards of living. Germany gets punished with Berlin, capital of losers. In all the republic, Berlin is home to the largest number of arseholes by far. Deutsche Bahn, Bundestag, Air Berlin and Axel Springer are but a few examples of all the incompetent scum being kept here. Glorious times have long since passed, the city is face down in the dirt. Berliners are lazy sods to their very core. Traits that would, in any civilised culture, pass for nothing but laziness, rudeness, incompetence, dissocial personality disorder or idiocy, are taken by the Berliner and declared a way of life. That is why the Berliner harbours intense feelings of hatred for anyone who’s better than him in any way. Especially the all-around superior Southern Germany are a thorn in his side. He envies their success, and Munich makes the top on his list of hatred. That city is – and has! – everything that Berlin wants to be and have. Berliners take no interest in the fact that it is Munich that finances their dissolute lifestyle, in fact, they secretly believe that they have earned it. So instead of freeing themselves from their envious and resentful lethargy, instead of rolling up their sleeves and improve their city, they revel in their antisocial freeloading and praise their so-called global city. Culturally, Berliners are set up rather weakly, great works lie far back in history. Moreover, mispronouncing “g” as “j” is considered a great cultural feat. Advanced students have mastered ending each and every sentence with a “wa?”. The city’s culinary performance is second-rate. Here, a sausage made from glued-together, meaty odds and ends adorned with ketchup and curry powder is sold as a culinary masterpiece. Hardly any reasonable person would consider a bratwurst with ketchup a recipe, let alone the holy grail of culinary arts. Yet, in their magnanimity, the rest of the republic lets the Berliner keep his delusion, not wanting to amplify his inferiority complex. Economically, Berlin is an utter disaster, even the late GDR stood on more solid ground. The local economy is based around alternative blogs, something-something-media and, if universities are to be believed, gender studies. Disregarding his own bankruptcy, the Berliner treats himself to prestigious projects like the city palace and the airport – which, considering its inoperative nature, is likely an art installation. Moreover, the city houses all popular parties’ headquarters, who refrain from using “traitors” in their official names (Probably for marketing reasons). For the longest time, this “town’s” “mayor”, the jolly Wowibear, butchered anything he found left in a presentable state. Long story short: Berlin is Germany’s tiled coffee table. It is to Germany what Greece is to the European Union, and if it had open sewerage, it would be Germanys Romania. Berlin is a blemish, the abscess on the arse of the nation. Berlin is the uninvited party guest, who didn’t even bring any booze and wouldn’t even understand he’s not welcome if he had is teeth beaten out and got thrown down the stairs. Berlin is the Detroit of Germany and should be sold to Poland for 200 Złoty.",78,1522603000.0,/r/Games/comments/88qf0e/cyberpunk_2o77_review_thread/

That's over. Everything is a computer now. The CPU and GPU are compiler targets. Every game can run on every machine, and most do. The Switch is a glorified smartphone and it's getting Doom Eternal at launch. Even secondary networking features are so universal that they only highlight the needless division between brands.

Second interview. His name is Ryota Suzuki. This is his bio at the end of the interview.

**Ryota Suzuki**

*A game designer who belongs to the Third Development Business Headquarters. Joined Capcom Co., Ltd. in 1999. He has been involved in the development of 3D action games and 2D fighting games for 20 years. Moved to Square Enix in 2019. Currently he is the battle director for the new AAA title.*

*Masterpieces: Devil May Cry 5, Dragon's Dogma*

Honestly, I'm super stoked for FFXVI. The idea that we don't see any party members is slightly worrying, but I fully trust CBU3 completely.

From what little I can piece together from the trailer, I think what's happening is that the trailer is just a quick look into the world and introducing *one* of the main characters. CBU3's writing staff likes to explore all sides of a conflict in the narrative if possible, so we're probably getting an Octopath Traveler-style start where you get to play as all of the potential party members one by one from different factions and other parts of the world, before they meet up and travel together. That would mean there probably is no true 'lead character', and everyone gets to be super fleshed out.

Consider that the trailer footage appears to be explaining things in *reverse order*. There's clearly a timeskip thing going on. The trailer starts off with the lead character being part of a faction hunting down 'Shiva's Dominant' (who I theorize to be a party member later), and what sets him down this path is what happened between the boy and Phoenix when he was younger.

That also means if there are multiple party members, they most likely meet up AFTER the timeskip. Which *also* means that for once, we might get a party made up of unambiguous ADULTS.

EDIT: Okay, I need to redact something regarding the boy and Phoenix. I noticed at around 1:57 in the trailer, the *lead character* sprouts phoenix wings during their attacking animation. Which would make *them* Phoenix's Dominant, and the boy might be Ifrit.",65,1600294254.0,/r/Games/comments/iu3hwh/final_fantasy_xvi_awakening_trailer_ps5/

Visually, this looked like a downgrade from FF15. I really thought midway through that I had my roman numerals off and that this was some singleplayer version of FF 14.

Gameplay wise, I didn't see any of the JRPG elements synonymous with FF displayed at any point. Combat looks like a 3rd person hack and slash. That's fine and I hope it'll be good, but that's not what I typically think of when it comes to final fantasy.

Storywise, I have no idea what's going on, who is who, why everyone is so angry, where they are, and what anyone's motivation is. 

If you're not going to sell me on the visuals and the combat/gameplay is incomplete or can't be displayed right now, then the story is all that's left but on first viewing, I'm not even positive I know what the main character looks like.",81,1600290280.0,/r/Games/comments/iu3hwh/final_fantasy_xvi_awakening_trailer_ps5/

Sony's strategy was never going to pay off early, because their strategy is to use the best of the best small chips. What that *does* let them do is have a comparable chip cost to Microsoft going into the gen, but Sony's chip cost will fall drastically and quickly, while Microsoft's will always be high due to the bigger chip size. Improvements in yield can make big 50CU chips cheaper, but given the same improvement in process, you will gain good 32CU chips faster than you gain 50CU chips, and a couple years in I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft will be paying double what Sony is paying per chip.

Here's what Digital Foundry wrote:
>""It's really important to clarify the PlayStation 5's use of variable frequencies. It's called 'boost' but it should not be compared with similarly named technologies found in smartphones, or even PC components like CPUs and GPUs. There, peak performance is tied directly to thermal headroom, so in higher temperature environments, gaming frame-rates can be lower - sometimes a lot lower. This is entirely at odds with expectations from a console, where we expect all machines to deliver the exact same performance. To be abundantly clear from the outset, PlayStation 5 is not boosting clocks in this way. According to Sony, all PS5 consoles process the same workloads with the same performance level in any environment, no matter what the ambient temperature may be.""

Even more insight gives [this Digital Foundry interview.](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-playstation-5-the-mark-cerny-tech-deep-dive)

In short:       
- Max clocks within capabilites of PS5 cooling     
- Max clocks can be sustained      
- Variable clocks are only for power optimization (minimize power spikes to increase overall power budget)       
- All PS5s will perform similar wether in hot room or fridge       
- SmartShift helps with efficient power distribution

**But acquiring Bethesda is a big fucking deal.** This is what Microsoft needed to ensure that the XSX wasn't going to be dead on arrival. This is what they needed to ensure that the PS5 didn't outsell the system by over 2 to 1 like last time.

Microsoft now have The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Doom, Wolfenstein, Prey, Quake, Dishonored and Rage as future exclusives. These franchises have lots of fans and anybody with a vested interest in these games is probably thinking twice about their PlayStation 5 pre-order, knowing that Microsoft have basically poached at least one of the franchises they love.

Also, unlike with Rare where they damn near gutted the company through forcing poor managerial decisions on them, Microsoft have been relatively hands-off with their core studios this time around. There was a lot of doom and gloom surrounding Mojang when they were acquired but they've remained a loved and respected developer. Though in that case... it was wholly beneficial for Minecraft to remain multiplatform due to the universal appeal it had among kids, the already huge install base the game had across many of its platforms, and the billions Microsoft undoubtedly make in merchandising.

I'm rooting for Microsoft here, not just because they're not the same company they were fifteen years ago, but because Bethesda have become greedy as fuck and need a powerful parent company to sink some morals back into them. I can't believe I'm saying this about Microsoft in 2020 but they are the best major publisher out there right now. They've become a lot more humble since 2013.

au82hx,CannotDenyNorConfirm,"With the purchase of an Oculus, I realized that I wanted to be lazy, I don't play that much VR in the end, and I enjoy flat games as much as I do VR. The current capabilities of VR is also a great drawback to be honest, the screen-door effect, the resolution that impact looking at distances, the lack of focal adjustment, so close objects are very blurry.

So even though VR is surely to become bigger, I wouldn't say people will adopt it on the very long run as much as flat games. It'll be cool now and then, sure. 


EDIT: I was replying to someone but it got deleted, so. 

>/u/GarfcomDotBiz: 10-20 years from now, you'll still be playing flat games. They'll just be on virtual AR screens. 

>Me: You like having pixels two inches from your face, I don't. So unless it's direct neural interface I'll be good thanks. But hey, seeing our technological leap just then, we might be there then also.

EDIT2: Until any drawback is impressively diminished, which would make you prioritize VR over 2D, I don't see the general population even coming close to going towards VR on the regular. And VR enthusiasts are VR enthusiasts. You don't go see cake lovers and ask them if you should bake a cake.

au82hx,CelicetheGreat,"Has VR done anything to earn that claim of ""biggest generational leap"" though? Mario 64 is often lauded as having large influence thanks to the analog stick of the system, and it being used in a functional and precise way that made playing feel genuinely new.

I've had a VR headset for over a year, and have found it more novelty than anything. There's a genuine lack of compelling experience or circumstance for me. I love Beat Saber. I really enjoyed playing Metroid Prime in VR thanks to a custom Dolphin build. Playing through tons of custom maps for Doom and Quake is awesome. 

But at the end of it, I always feel like I'm playing with Wiimotes and a screen with depth is plastered to my face. 

It does not grow beyond what motion controls from Twilight Princess, or Metroid Prime 3, offered to me a decade ago. I played them as I played Gorn or Superhot: swinging a difference piece of plastic with gyro sensors.

Does anyone have any recommendation for VR games or experiences that exceed what we have already had in the past? So far the closest thing I can think of was the first time I tried Skyrim VR and proceeded to sweep the room with a broom I found, or put objects around the dungeon like it was a home decorating simulator.

Each time Sigyn fails and the venom hits his eyes, Loki pulls on the chains so hard that an earthquake starts. One day, Loki breaks the chains and I believe every chain on Earth is also broken.

egg2sw,Mista_Wong,">Honest question: why Sony/MS never developed their own game engines specifically tailored to their consoles? Not so much now, but it would make sense in the PS3 era since it's hardware was so fucked up.

They basically do. Like others mentioned there's Phyre Engine.

Sony also has ICE Team, which is part of Naughty Dog. They are Sony's R&D for graphics and game tech. Tools and libraries that aid development are shared with their first party devs. So these are things that studios will implement into their engines.

But the issue with a jack of all trades engine is that it's just that, master of none. Whereas many Sony studios are masters of their crafts, like Naughty Dog is a master of 3rd person cinematic action games with Uncharted and TLOU. Their internal tools and engine is built around these types of games right now. Any engine Sony produced wouldn't be the same. And the same goes for other developers like Polyphony Digital who make Gran Turismo for example, their engine is specifically designed for racing games. If Sony made an engine and told them to use it then there'd be endless back and forth discussions about features they want adding. 

Then eventually everyone gives up, takes a fork of the engine and tunes it themselves and you're back to square one. 

That's why even large studios who use Unreal or Unity still have a shit tonne of other tooling around the engine to tailor it to their specific needs. They use those engines as the foundations. But when you're a decades old Sony studio, you've already got the foundations.",62,1577484810.0,/r/Games/comments/egg2sw/shuhei_yoshida_developers_tell_us_they_never/
egg2sw,ggtsu_00,"Sony did create their own engine called the Phyre engine and shipped it with the PS4 SDK. Many games did use it, but it had some serious limitations. Most of the games that ended up using it were low budget JRPGs.

The problem with general purpose game engines is that they are simultaneously too complex and too heavy weight for simple games that only need basic features where the developer can more easily write an engine from scratch that they can easily understand and only add the features their game needs. At the same time, they are too simple or too limited and don’t offer the specific requirements needed for a specific game with specific feature that makes the game unique. A general purpose game engine needs to try and satisfy a too broad range of usecases but never quite enough without crumbling under its own complexity. Console games that try and push the hardware to its absolute limits have little to no wiggle room for any wasted resources so the engine can’t afford to have any features the game doesn’t need.


Both unreal and unity have these problems as well. There are pretty much no AAA games developed in Unity, and for Unreal, nearly every AAA that worked with it had to deal with serious performance issues and memory usage constraints on consoles thus ended up heavily modifying the engine’s source code which often maintaining a modified engine is even harder than building one from scratch.",55,1577479682.0,/r/Games/comments/egg2sw/shuhei_yoshida_developers_tell_us_they_never/

Eventually, as manufacturing costs go down, they'll introduce more digital models.  


Now of course that's just a theory, but it makes sense if you really think about it. People who buy all-digital for their games are going to continue purchasing digital even if they have a disc model, so it's basically a win-win for Sony.

**Lackey**: Our research has turned up promising information about a historically black NYC neighborhood. They call it....Har-Lem.""

It seems like they even upgraded the graphics a bit , compared to the announcement trailer , look at the grass top right and less ugly birds and the background now has new and better looking buildings. Its interesting how much they changed compared to the older demo. (looks better for me)

I'm actually curious how everyone here will react, given the general negative attitude towards the game.

I played the beta myself for a couple of hours but it just wasn't for me. The animations were smooth but the overall muddy art style put me off. 

The gameplay structure was ok but once you get into the meat of it it's pretty basic. Combat isn't very deep and aside from a few differences (Thor and Tony flying, opening up aerial combat a bit), everyone played kinda the same. Perhaps in a later part of the game some strategy comes into play, regarding abilities, but what was available in the demo (and it was pretty substantial) didn't really do it for me.

Overall i think it will be a pretty decent affair but it has a huge potential to end up like Anthem, if not handled properly.

I just beat the game last night and, only sticking to the campaign without going into any of the online Co-Op quests I was only around level 10 of 50 for roughly most of my characters. 

This was a huge problem for the final couple of missions. The game introduces what I assume are a preview of endgame enemies (Adaptoids) , and they are *very* annoying to fight. Most of their attack are unblockable and unable to be parried, and your defense breaking attacks have no effect. Theres effectively no planning and it just feels like you have to mindlessly mash square and triangle, and spam circle (dodging in this feels sooo bad) whenever they wind up an attack. 

Hopefully there is a massive rework of dodging and parrying coming sooner rather than later because the final mission really wasn’t fun anymore after dying to bullshit you don’t even understand how to get better at, because of how wonky it feels.",99,1599136206.0,/r/Games/comments/ilr1e8/marvels_avengers_review_thread/

8bhv18,Radulno,"Cyberpunk and Starfield are the big rumored games and the ones I'm very excited.

I do not believe the PS5 rumors one minute, way too early. They'll show Last of Us 2 and Ghost of Tutshima gameplay very likely, hopefully Death Stranding too. Probably also a clarification on the from software game teased. Also probably a showing of Spider-Man but it won't be the big one. God of War DLC too. 

EA will show Anthem and the Battlefield and sports game, maybe a new title but I'm not sure from which studio.

Ubisoft will have a Splinter Cell game apparently, probably more details on Division 2 and something like Skulls and Bones. Possibly an Assassin's Creed this year but that's not sure.

Bethesda will have Starfield most likely and possibly standalone DLC (ala Death of The Outsider) for Prey and Wolfenstein 2.

I haven't heard much on Microsoft but I hope they have great exclusives (but from who?). Time to be a serious competitor to Sony for them. I think they'll have a lot of multiplat game showing, probably from Ubisoft, Cyberpunk 2077 and maybe COD (though they preferred Sony the last few years). EA will also probably have some stuff with MS. 

On the PC gamer show if that's still a thing, a lot of indies as usual. Something like Total War Three Kingdoms, Age of Empires 4 (except if it's at MS conference but a PC only game there?), Phoenix Point, maybe Valve for Artifact? And no not Half life 3.

I don't really follow Nintendo to be honest so no idea there.

Wonder if we might see RDR2 they don't really do E3 but a gameplay trailer to one of the Sony/MS conference would be huge and they release in September after all. 

EDIT : Oh just thought of it but on multiplats from devs without their own conferences, we might see at least the Avengers Square Enix game, Shadow of the Tomb Raider (well it's sure for this one) and the next Rocksteady and WB Montreal games (one of them is making a Superman game if the rumors are right). Would say Microsoft conf if they haven't a ton of hidden exclusives to show us.

If anybody wants me to explain the reasoning behind a certain point, let me know. Edit: updated a few things, moved some games about.

Also just want to add I am really confident on the focus that MS and Sony will go down with their showcases, in terms of the bits in italics.

Fable 4 early cinematic trailer (no gameplay)

Whatever Gen Design is up to now

8bhv18,weezermc78,"I have a great feeling that this E3 will be huge for all three major companies. 

Xbox knows they have to come surging back some way, I really hope for the gaming community they have some killer exclusives planned for holiday. We need competition. Better competition means better gaming for us gamers. 

Sony is going to kill it with Death Stranding, Ghosts of Tsushima and Last of Us 2. Though I don't think any of those three will get a release date other than 2019, 2019 and coming soon, respectively. I am also excited to see whatever other tricks they have up their sleeves

Speaking of tricks up sleeves, we cannot forget about the king of those: Nintendo.  Nintendo has been murdering the competition and with Smash on the horizon, there seems to be plenty of room to the hype ceiling. I really hope Nintendo gives us a one two punch with Smash in September and Pokemon in December. Though I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo lets Smash be thier one huge fall game. That game will be a system seller, and using all their resources to make it the best game (and stable on launch for online) will only launch the Switch further into the stratosphere. 

And Nintendo, you know they have tricks up their sleeves. For whatever reason, Nintendo are experts on keeping stuff within their walls. Who knows what else they're doing besides Smash. I pray for an Animal Crossing, Pikmin and the absolute long shot of another F-Zero. I think MP4 will get a longer, maybe even gameplay trailer, but I don't see it coming out 2018. MP4 will definitely be a Q4 2019 title. 

I love E3. I watch every year and most years I am amazed at the high quality announcements that each company has.  It's been an excellent few years to be a gamer.  This generation is probably the best gaming generation in my lifetime.  For reference, I'm late 20s. I lived through the N64/Ps1, the GameCube/Xbox/PS2 and beyond.

- Allows people to switch platform and play some of the exclusives from last gen that they could have missed. 

- Give people something to play at launch.

Instead it will be bought from supermarkets, who have stock for the first week and only of a few big releases. As a brit its a pain in the arse to get games sometimes because of this and all the games stores shutting. Dont' forget the big store also charge full price when its a big game.

/rgames has a hardon against games stores, without realizing that they are essential for gaming as a whole outside of the niche that we are in, we are not the casual market, they are for the more casual market. But thats reddit in a nutshell with most communities like nintendoswitch and ps4, thinks its the market, very much isn't.

Without GAME's sales of games in the UK would drop by a decent degree, slightly more niche games even more so.

Also don't forget, while the parents bought little Timmy that game at full price, the next game he buys will be cheaper due to being able to get money back via preowned, meaning more full price game sales.

>However, we found out something important about the system and we would like to tell you about it.

>The trigger of DualSense is an ""adaptive trigger"" that changes its ""hardness"" in accordance with the operation at the time. In the case of ASTRO's PLAYROOM, there are operations where the direction is determined by the tilt of the DualSense and the trigger is used to determine the sinking of the spring to jump. The ""hardness of the spring"" is reproduced as the hardness of the trigger. That's why you can feel that you can jump with this much strength if you push in this much.
