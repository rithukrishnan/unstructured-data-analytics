A 5 alarm fire in the paper district, tastebuds up in smoke. Quickdraw McNally ten paces back from the crooked lawman, and Quickdraw didn't get his name by playin' fair. On the count of three, he draws on two, and puts a 16 ounce, 8.3 calibre Very Green slug right between the eyes of the lawman, sending him down with an oily, resinous, bitter thud. Aggressive and boisterous, the onslaught of earthy, peppery, piquant Galaxy hops deliver what I suppose are classic Galaxy notes, but turned up to 13. There's that musty, dank, way too ripe apricot, peach, and nectarine, and well as some bright acidid pineapple, but then a tsunami of earthy, green resins just flood the palate bringing some sharp black pepper and then the most saturated resinous bitterness I've tasted. It's bitter, don't be fooled, but it isn't the bitterness that stands out, but rather how insanely sense and saturated the hop delivery is. It's almost too concentrated to find any quieter notes. This is not a quiet beer. It's loud, bold, and entirely in your face. That bitterness peaks early, washing out the fruity pineapple, and turning into pure, raw Galaxy hops, which just linger on and on and on, with firm resins, clingy oils, and looking bitterness slowly escorting it away."", ""Mouthfeel/Body: Just like Green, it's big and soft, like a teddy bear. A teddy bear that can rip your face off with an explosion of hops, but it's still big and soft. The softness of Green always stuck out to me. The sheer aggression of the hops sort of lend a rawness to that fluffy body (as well as a rawness to the roof of your mouth!), but the amount of resinous hop oils make up for a lot of that. Effervescence is absolutely perfect, and even a bit lively given the nature and weight of the beer. Oils just cling all over the mouth and accumulate with every sip.""]",0.0

There are whispers of fruit notes beneath the assault of all things hoppy and bitter, with the suggestion of some peach, apricot, mango, and pineapple, but that's quickly whisked away when that signature earthy boiled Simcoe note comes in, giving a huge nod to Pliny - if Pliny was on that Barry Bonds love potion number 9 joose. It's like getting pulled over after a high speed car chase even though all you did was run a stop sign. Sure, you can surrender, but you're getting pummeled either way, and it's gonna hurt.

And it marks my passage from beer drinker to beer appreciator. I am thirsty for more.', 'I chose the Westy to mark a half-thousand beers consumed not only because it is an excellent and well-regarded beer. It is symbolic. More than a sample of a precise chemical craft, or brewing, the Westy represents the origins of my beer hobby, and the evolution of my palate and my interest in the field of beer. Above all, this particular bottle was a gift from the very person who introduced me to beer. It is a gesture that I took his invitation to heart, and have faithfully pursued the hobby well after we parted to different parts of the globe. And it is a mark of my respect for his patience in enduring my initial skepticism, callousness and thick-headedness when it came to drinking beer and taking notes. I owe him a great debt, and I honor that debt by drinking his beer.', 'I took great care and attached great ceremony to reviewing the Westvleteren. Ambient noise and smells were minimized. Paper and pen were placed nearby, ready to receive observations and hastily scrawled epiphanies. I cleared my head of distractions (there are many) and focused exclusively on this laughably humble bottle and its innards. I girded myself for my Westvleteren 12.', 'The pour is pretty standard, even mundane. It kicks up a light brown head, little to no lacing, and aside from a few flecks of yeast in the last droplets to fall from the bottle’s mouth, I have no physical evidence that this beer will be a milestone in my beer drinking career. That evidence appears in the aroma. I am stricken with childhood memories of happy Colorado Christmases, as an intoxicating blend of vanilla, oak, ribeye steaks, fig, and a touch of chocolate fill my nose. It is incredible, and it is here that I first get a taste of what all the praise, writing and hype is about. The Westy isn’t hype at all. It is credibly amazing, and deservedly loved. And the taste fits the Quad. style I’ve come to love so much. It is big and rich, barreling onto the tongue with the same aromatic flavors that caused me to reel in my chair. A few seconds later this boldness attenuates, exposing an undercurrent of fig and a deep, sweet red wine flavor. And then again, moments later this layer of flavor recedes to expose a tertiary layer of molasses, oak, smoked wood and a parmesan cheese like umami. To be short, there are three distinct layers of flavors, each of them characteristically delicious, and each a little quieter than the last. That final touch of umami savoriness is practically a whisper, but you can still make out the words.', 'With all these flavors in a single beer there is a very real threat that the flavors may become crowded and muddled. This is not the case. The Westvleteren 12 delivers these flavors in stages, and on a perfect palate. The beer is thick, but not syrupy, and it textures the flavors without warping them. It is a crowd of luminaries, each in perfect concordance with the others, a kind of harmony of brilliance without egos to interfere.', 'By the very end of the beer I am questioning whether this is actually a Quadrupel. It has all the basic qualities of a Belgian Strong Ale according to my taste buds, and possibly according to a rigid style guide. But I think the Belgian Strong Ale tag might be slightly too tight on a beer like this. The Westvletren is an expression of a style, and a permutation so fantastically brewed that it almost breaks from tradition. These breaks are sometimes called revolutions, which would be the highest form of irony for the Westy’s brewers who are steeped in tradition themselves. But they are also steeped in this beer, and they must know that what they do, they do very well. This level of brewing is intentional, and it shows. One need only look at the lines of avid drinkers banging on the monastery’s doors to understand that there must be some authentic draw to this beer. And now I finally realize it through a few intense sips. I’ve extended a dimension of my understanding of beer and the craft beer world with one bottle of a highly-esteemed brew. This really is a fantastic hobby.']",0.0

Back then, you turned up on spec, no appointment or reservation needed, and loaded up. 10 crates was the max. If you are lucky, you can get two crates now.

No succumbing to fad or fashion. Now, a further, but very important point. Listen to the monks! Westvleteren is made to age. It really does get more surreal with months, even years on it, if stored cool. Yesterday I cracked open a bottle from my stash brewed in January 2019. For me, it has cream and ginger characteristics, and they were really getting a hold here and singing. For you - well, you decide. Even the taste evolution from the February release was interesting. Its texture, too, is like no other. You don't just taste it - you hear it. So. Drinking Westveleteren 12 (and 8 and 6 for that matter) is a ceremony.

This one harkens back to the old days of Treehouse. Body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. Smooth and rich but not full on the palate and finishes soft with a lingering aftertaste.""]",0.0

Acidity is mild to moderate, with a quick twinge upfront, and quickly extinguished by the dry, tannic, splintery white oak.

Some might argue the people are loud and flamboyant, they steal our women, the succer players melodramatically flop on the pitch. Listen - that\'s all part of the secret Italian ingredient - keep it cool, confident, arrogant and extravagant. Forza Italia."" Brewed in the style of an American Imperial Stout, brewed with natural flavor and aged in Bourbon Barrels. Available in 22 oz. bottles and on limited annual release draft.', 'Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a snifter glass.', '(Appearance) Pours a rich, dark chocolate head of a crisp frothy consistency over a jet black, moderately viscous body. Retention is below average and lacing is light and patchy. 4', '(Smell) Chocolate wafers, light caramel malt body and a delicate roast with overtones of Bourbon notes and a touch of sharp alcohol heat. The aroma of the body is perceptibly light yet appealing. Potency is moderate. 3.75', '(Taste) Velvety, nutty chocolate forward with smooth caramel and vanilla undertones, finishing on a smooth transition to a slick, strongly flavored back end of bourbon flavor and soft heat. Nicely flavored in all the right places- surprisingly light drinking with a deceptively high ABV. The bourbon is very well integrated into this beer. 4.25', '(Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, moderately oily, lightly chewy, smooth, medium dry. Carbonation is modest, generating a medium frothiness and a mildly crisp finish. Body is medium for the style, heavy overall. Balance is nearly even sweet to earthy roast bitterness and bourbon alcohol. Alcohol presence is moderate and there are no off characters. 4.5', ""(Overall) Integrating bourbon into an already thoroughly enjoyable Imperial Stout does help complicate (for the better) the drinkability of this otherwise highly drinkable and nicely balanced Imperial Stout, graduating it to a more graceful, slower sipping beer, expected of a quality Imperial Stout. The subtleties of this beer are widespread, with the focus remaining equally on the chocolate and bourbon, this beer does not lose any of its focus. One of the prized annual releases in EvilTwin's lineup and worthy of seeking out whenever it comes into town. A marked and welcome improvement over Imperial Biscotti Break standard and certainly worth the extra couple of bucks. 4.25"", ""Evil Twin Brewing's"", 'Imperial Biscotti Break: Bourbon Barrel Aged']",0.0

Highly polished, highly reflective, mesmerising to stare at glowing ruby gemstone red - clear, but not crystal. A finger of quick, loose, just-slightly-pink head builds up, and then quickly reduces to a thin soapy collar. Some slow effervescence can be seen."", ""Nose: There are average cherry wild ales, and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma. This is in the latter category. The amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated, while being entirely organic in nature. Not only is this a cherry bomb aroma, but what is really impressive is how both the Montmorency AND the Balaton cherries seem to translate. There is some intensely sweet, ripe, juicy Balaton character, lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note, bursting with big, deep, dark cherry juice, while the Montmorency cherries lend that floral, fresh, tangy cherry note, with a touch of stem, pit, and even cherry blossom. There is also a healthy amount of oak, and, along with the cherries, seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note, with just a whisper of oaky vanillins. There is a suggestion of acidity, but it doesn't singe the nose when inhaling, and there's very little earthy or barnyard funk. Just some wet oak, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, and a hint of brett. The cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath. There's a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything, which is the icing on the cake."", ""Palate: First thing, from the very first sip, it isn't bracing sourness that hits, it isn't tannic oak, it isn't malt, it's sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh. The deep, bold Balaton sweetness greets the palate, giving up its sweet juicy goodness, while never coming across as artificial, cough syrupy, sticky, or overly sweet. This sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the Montmorency character beneath. The Montmorency is not quite as deep, bold, and saturated with juicy sweetness, but it provides a slightly less ripe, slightly fruitier character, that brings Japanese cherry blossom, a bit of plum, a hint of cherry potpourri, cinnamon/amburana wood spice, and a bright, natural, almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table. In addition to this subtle fruity tartness, the acidity lends a near-perfect degree of sour. It really isn't bracing, puckering, or blinding in any way. Make no mistake, this is a sour ale, no question about it, but it isn't Midwest sour. There is some lemony lacto pucker, a bit less of some acetic pedio bite, and a bit more of some tart, funky, mineralic brett, lending not quite salinity, and definitely not sweat, but that classic restrained brett tang, along with some musty wet wood, a little hint of bandaid, and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note. The high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a Kriek vibe. The tartness has a quick downward curve, allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish, paired with a hint of vanilla, a hint of baking spice, a hint of caramel, and a hint of brown sugar. The sourness takes a far back seat, revealing some more dusty brett, and then finally, the ever-so-slightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself, with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley, cereal grains, essence of cherry, and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish."", ""Mouthfeel/Body: MvB is light, crisp, and snappy by nature, though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to medium-bodied territory. Effervescence is surprisingly low. It isn't flat, but rather lazy and slow. One might expect this to be a super fizzy, champagne-like experience, but that is not the case, which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel. Soft, round, and even quite juicy upfront, the ale is not scrubbing, and even feels somewhat smooth. The oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades, but the ale itself isn't tannic or ultra-dry.""]",0.0

A warming alcohol note towards the end is a bit out of place, but at 10% this beer has a ton of flavors and is certainly not a booze bomb.

It isn't a starchy, malty sweetness, but rather a concentrated fructose sweetness, like ripe tropical fruit. Speaking of ripe tropical fruit, the flavour is bursting with ripe mango, pineapple, papaya, and overripe peach, the latter being very indicative of the Galaxy hops that are crammed into this. There are some bright, juicy, slightly acidic notes of orange juice and grapefruit, which highly compliment the pineapple notes, and also help to cut through some of the sweetness. Much of this acidity is presumably hop burn, though it's restrained enough to be enjoyable, adding a layer of complexity rather than being detrimental to the beer itself. There is just a touch of earthy dankness which is also to be expected from a bill containing any amount of Galaxy. I suspect the grist contains a measurable amount of oat, as the malt is clean, fairly neutral, and possesses practically zero graininess. The finish is quite fruity and floral, before the sweetness gently subsides, allowing just a touch of resinous bitterness to peek through at the very end, before lifting off, leaving a clean, oaty dryness and a whisper of peach lingering."", ""Mouthfeel/Body: It's a big, bold, dry hopped New England double IPA clocking in at 9.3% ABV, AND it's from Trillium. Anyone who has had a big Trillium IPA can imaging that this beer is just one massively fluffy hoppy pillow. The beer is soft, fluffy, creamy, and velvety smooth, yet still possesses enough effervescence to lend texture and cut through some of the heft. Nevertheless, this is a very stout beer, and is by no means a midday summer refresher. While the flavour profile would allow this to pair nicely with food, I think the sheer weight of it may prevent it from being the ideal mean accompaniment.

This is going to be interesting. Let's begin."", 'Upon greeting the palate, the ale carries a mild malt sweetness, with an absolute ton of maltiness. Fresh baked still soft dark bread, rum-soaked fruit cake, and cola emerge, peppered with dark spiced rum notes. An explosion of dark fruit reveals notes of prune, fermented cherry, dates, raisin, and fig. Along with these dark fruit notes comes a character I generally only find in red wine cask-aged ales - fruity, yet dry wine grape/red berry notes, with the typical fermented wine flair. This actually shifts along with the dark fruit notes to become fairly earthy, and extremely similar to the port note in a port cask-aged imperial stout. Some subtle European hop spice and earthiness pair up with this wine-like character, and the initial malt sweetness begins to fade to the background, followed closely behind by much of the dark fruit notes. Into the finish, it becomes earthy and spicy, with the earthiness coming primarily from hops, but some of that tawny port note still lingers. At this point - well into the finish - the flavour takes a turn, and it suddenly takes on the characteristics of a traditional German amber/dark lager. The caramelised bread notes, the subtle spicy hopes, and most of all, the yeast flavour takes on a lager-esqu flavour, complete with the very subtle metallic note. The cola, spice, sweetness, malt, dark fruit, and earthiness fade away, and the ale concludes with the aftertaste of European hops and a whisper of dark bread.', ""Mouthfeel/Body: The body is rather unique, because it's both rich and crisp at the same time. It greets the palate medium-bodied, with a very tight crispness about it. Soon after, the maltiness lends a big, soft, not-quite-chewy richness to it, pushing it close to full-bodied territory, but constantly remains balanced by a very lively fizzy effervescence. It's wet, soft, and even a bit slick upfront, but as it finishes, it dries out and becomes fairly crisp once again. There are stages where the ale is crisp, medium, and full-bodied, but it's a harmonious transition, and in the end, I would put this in the medium-bodied category. Slight acidity in the first half of the beer, which is slowly extinguished by the malt. Semi-dry finish with mild drying properties, and some slight hop resin cling. Becomes sticky around the lips. Very mild alcohol warmth from the back of the throat to below the sternum, from its 10% ABV, and fluid nature.""]",0.0

Apart from a slightly roasted opening, coconut utterly dominates in the best/worst way around the middle and end. Coffee plays second fiddle to the coconut flavors, just like the aroma indicated. Speaking of how it ends, the finish comes across like this coconut coffee porter had three tons of table sugar clumsily added to it - there\'s that ""so sweet, it\'s somehow bitter"" sensation I get from a select few dessert beers (like Creme Brulee from Southern Tier...or Maple Bacon Coffee Porter from Funky Buddha themselves!) At the end of the day, the actual flavor of this beer is a total letdown next to the awesome nose. Plus, it feels thin and angular - not a good combination with the extreme levels of sweetness.

I get coffee, maple, toffee, almost burnt but not sugar, vanilla, medium to darker caramel, some background fruitiness, and a bit of ashen roastiness. Is it smoky? I don\'t think so, not really, there is some in the far away background but I wouldn\'t consider it smoky. Still, it\'s good. It\'s nice and rich without being overly so, and sweetish but not too sweet although some of that maple sugar does linger on the palate. It\'s not really a dessert beer though, or is it? It could certainly be used as an ingredient in a dessert but it is rich enough to be a dessert beer on its own? Ahhh, maybe. So, OK, what else? Medium bodied and gently crisp then smooth.']",0.0

What head is there comes via a ring of khaki foam that lingers a long while. Aroma is huge, hitting all the notes of the base beer - cinnamon, cardamon, nutmeg, chilies and other spices. Dark chocolate and cocoa powder add a little dry sweetness. Medium-bodied, dark coffee is interwoven throughout the structure of the nose, never taking the limelight, instead subtly reminding the palate it\'s there. Roasty, toasty malts add firm and dark support, but are an afterthought to the additive flavors. Flavor profile is deep notes of mingling cardamon, nutmeg, ancho (mild) chilies and cinnamon with medium-bodied, dark coffee, and roasty malts up front. Medium-bodied coffee hits center stage for a brief glimpse between spices and malts, and then returns to lingering and observing from aside the curtain. While spices eagerly welcome each sip like a used car salesman do for a visitor to the lot, they quickly fade to show the frame work of this beer - roasty, toasty, nutty malts - in other words, robust and dark. Between the dynamics of spices, coffee, and malts, there are flashes of chocolate, cocoa powder, and molasses. Very dynamic despite a slightly heavy hand on the spices. Perhaps more so than any other beer I\'ve had, serving temperature is critical here. Too cold and the spices come off heavy, but as the beer warms a touch, the spices meld into the dark malt backdrop, forming a sublime experience. As this beer nears the 50F mark, it develops a sublime balance. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a smooth, creamy texture that develops a fairly still texture when served directly out of the fridge. As the beer warms, it develops a more grainy, velvety texture, enhancing the experience. Overall, the headline here is ""ABRAXAS"", with the subtitle being ""enters a non-mutually exclusive relationship with coffee"". Coffee is present, particularly as the beer warms, but never steps into the limelight for more than a brief second or two.

TBH I realised life is short there are too many beers out there for one man to drink (and review) so I’ve been sticking with the “good stuff”. Rodenbach Caractère Rouge: good stuff I’ve heard, plus I already love Rodenbach Grand Cru, seems like a no brainer.

It’s upfront sugar: red current, cherry, raspberry, cranberry, grape-aid, hints of vanilla, then in comes that classic Flanders Red Ale sharp acidic tart overtone to cut through all sweetness and finish crisp and moreish. It comes with an acid reflux trigger warning: you will get reflux from this if you’re susceptible. Further sips make me question the amount of tartness in this brew - such a complex and beautiful homage to berry fruits, yet it’s a touch too sour IMO.

As it warms up, the oak and tannins seem to combine with the acidity to give a vinous flavour, like a Syrah; in my mind, it seems to impart a lot of red wine notes into the flavour; I suspect this is due to the combination of the oak tannins and the acidity. Whiskey is there, underneath all of this. No heat, but a subtle char is noticeable towards the end.

It's really a fascinating drinking experience."", ""The body is rich and substantial, which you'd think would be strange for an AWA, but it's substantial without being dry or creamy.

The aroma is resinous, citrusy, and otherwise fruity (apples, berries, dried apricot) over a biscuity and bready malt base. It's not the brightest aroma I've found in an IPA but it's certainly not hidden. Additionally, I like that the malt comes through as I've been finding a lot of beers lately that only display the hops. On to the taste... I think the aroma sets it up real well. So, to repeat, I'm finding a nicely blended mix of firm malt that's gently biscuity and bready with notes of hop resins, soft citrus, peach, apple and sweet berries, and subtle mango. A very firm bitterness anchors it from start to finish, and then dries it quite readily. It finishes medium-long with the hoppy fruitiness fading first, followed by some residual malt, and then earthy and leafy/herbal hops the linger the longest. Bitterness then trails for even longer. It has a mouth coating medium-full body with a standard carbonation that gently bristles but then warms to become smoother wrapped in the malt that's there. Overall it's really quite nice. It's got malt, hops, and bitterness - all balanced nicely - and that leads towards the possibility of multiple servings as it's got some complexity to maintain interest while not going overboard.""]",0.0

There is a jammy component, but it's also inherently tart, wild, and almost like it's still on the bush. There's a big oaky backbone beneath the berries, and a balanced acidity that moves back and forth between tart lactobacillus, and a slightly sharp balsamic acetic character. A swirl brings some peppery spice and some subtle farmhouse funk with wet wood, hay, stable, dusty attic, and stone cellar. Very nice."", 'Palate: Immediately, I\'m taken aback by just how balanced the acidity is here. It greets the palate with this wonderful tart tang. It\'s not even ""sour"" it\'s just beautifully tart, like malic acid. The blueberry jumps out immediately - the sugar fermented out, tasting very much like the skin of the berry. I also get some plum skin, some merlot grape, and plenty of actual wine barrel. Beneath the berry, the oak is absolutely massive, and serves as a driving force for the ale as a whole. The oak is musty, wet, tannic, and a little bit funky. The funk complexity here is truly something to behold. It runs deep, with huge minerality, wet stone, wet forest floor, damp cellar, lumber mill, leather, hay, dried grass, dried flowers, topsoil, overripe berries, and lots of earthy white wine notes - specifically chardonnay. The funk settles into a grainy wheat note, but it doesn\'t fully disappear, setting up the finish that lingers with berry skins, plum, all that wet oak funk, heavy minerality, white wine, farmhouse funk, stone, before concluding with this beautiful blueberry rock candy note, without the sweetness.', ""Mouthfeel/Body: Now this is just spectacular. The ale itself is as light as a feather, but the level of effervescence is almost unbelievable. Just as bubbly as champagne, but the bubbles are even finer. It feels like poprocks on the palate. You can actually hear it bubbling in your mouth, and feel the dozens and dozens of bubbles simultaneously burst. Zero weight, zero stickiness or cloy, extremely well-attenuated. Slightly numbs the tip of the tongue with its ultra-fine effervescence. Lingering minerality. Absolutely perfect acidity. I don't normally give out 5's, but there's no choice here.""]",0.0

Thank you Paul for the chance to tick this one!', 'Appearance: Pours a murky blueberry juice purple color, with a thin layer of head that completely settles. No lacing or retention, with a little residual oiliness that clings to the sides of the glass. 4/5', 'Smell: Blueberries and oak. A hint of citrus, and a little bit of wine/tannic character on the back half of the whiff. Some blue cheese/yogurty funk too. 3.75/5', 'Taste: Tart, but delicate blueberry flavor throughout. A hint of lemon zest upfront, with a wine flavored finish. Has a bit of that cheesy/yogurt funk lingering on the finish too, which I do not love, but which is also not pronounced enough to ruin the beer. Notes of oak and wheat on the finish too, increasingly so as it warms, masking much of the funk. 3.75', 'Mouthfeel: Light-medium bodied, appropriately carbonated. Has a delicateness to the sourness, without much acidity, though the finish is like a white wine with a mild tannic character. A little bit creamy on the mouthfeel. The dregs of the bottle make the last sips super dry. 4.5/5', 'Overall: This beer is complex and has an excellent mouthfeel, but I would prefer more blueberry fruitiness/tartness and less funk. I much prefer a blueberry sour more in the vein of Blueberry Flanders to this brew (though they are entirely different creatures).']",0.0
