My least favorite right now is the ""My Toyota"" one. That cheesy song remake gets on my nerves."

I've never heard them, cause I always videotape everything I want to watch so I can skip the commercials later. Are they trying to say the Odysey isn't good enough for people, only dogs should drive it? I always try to avoid companies with obnoxius commeercials, but I just bought a 00 Accord anyway. (I don't want my money going to finance more commercials that are annoying to me.)
For that reason, I haven't been to a Taco Bell since they started using that stupid dog a few years ago.

Anybody else have an opinion on the Odysey commercial?"
2	June 30, 2000 1:57PM	roadroach	"The whole point of commercials is to get your attention. They don't have to be relevant. I also find that whole series of commercials to be kinda stupid (even though it looks kinda sorta cool).

When the new Tundra came out, Toyota ran a commercial where they lined up the truck against a Lotus at a drag strip....of course the truck was losing....until they hit the dirt road at about 1/2 track. That was kinda different..."
3	June 30, 2000 3:04PM	markz2k	"Yeah, I agree the point is to get your attention, but it can easily backfire and turn customers away from buying your product. (Like me and Taco Bell)

Never saw the Tundra commercial, but it least it was relevant to the product. If the Accord hadn't been the best choice for me, I might very well have been swayed AWAY from Honda by those commercials. Not that the other manufacturers are any less obnoxious, just don't remember seeing one that was."
4	June 30, 2000 3:25PM	bdreggors	"I've noticed two fallicies in Hodna commercials:
1) The Accord Seminar commercial. The speaker says to ""Close your eyes...and picture yourself as this"" and the screens show pictures of Accords. But how can you see what it is if you close your eyes?

2) The Civic gas pump commercial. It's supposed to convey how fuel efficient the Civic is, but it shows a digital pump screen with the ""clikity-clack/ding"" sound of an analog pump.

This either says that Honda needs to analyze their commercials more before sending them to the TV stations, or I watch waaay to much TV!"
5	June 30, 2000 4:03PM	floridian	"The Camry commercial that says over and over that the Camry is too sexy for-------- God, that is irritating. How could ANYONE call a Camry sexy to begin with is beyond me. Throw that tape in the dumper!!

Floridian"
6	June 30, 2000 4:13PM	fezo	"Absolutely! Next Chevy will advertise sexy Malibus!

I absolutely detest the Toyotathon ads when they run. Does anyone still go to a car dealer because of a splashy campaign like that - ""oh, it looks like a lot of fun at the car dealership - let's go..."" Please!"
7	June 30, 2000 5:34PM	bdreggors	That's an oxymoron
8	June 30, 2000 5:46PM	microrepair	"is TOTALLY irritated by those Toyotathon commercials they run every month touting their ""Only 3 days left to get these big reductions""!!
What they mean is 3 days to the next one... And when have you ever seen 30 people milling around and running back and forth from one car to another in a dealer's showroom. Unless it was a couple of families with totally undisciplined kids.!!
What has any of that got to do with the features or quality of their cars???
I agree that one of the few ads of Toyota's that is any good is the Tundra going off the dragstrip into it's off-road mode.."
9	June 30, 2000 5:58PM	andrew21	"...the new ""zoom zoom zoom"" campaign by Toyota? I find it kinda catchy. But I suspect it's going to be real irritating when I hear it for the 15th time.

I like that BMW commercial where it shows one of their cars w/ a musical pattern being ""written"" by the engine note. Kewl.

I like the Porsche commercial for their Porsche Experience school. Very kewl."
10	June 30, 2000 6:16PM	roadroach	"I'm starting to get a little irritated by the Chevy Monte Carlo adds with the Tazmanian Devil. First off - there's nothing wild and unrestrained about the freakin' car (unless you count the drugs the stylists were obviously on when they pinned the whole sorry thing).

They've also been running the ads lately with Jeff Gordon in them.....ok, I guess I can see the tie in......except the NASCAR version of the Monte and the street version have nothing, zero, nada, zilch in common."
11	June 30, 2000 6:18PM	roadroach	Remember the Ford Focus commercial when it first came out? (Focus sitting in front of nightclub, music pumping, line of people waiting to get in). Yeah right, I can just see some hip-hop, gangsta rappa and his ladies partying in a.......Ford Focus. Ooooooookay.....
12	June 30, 2000 6:21PM	roadroach	I like the VW commercial where the guy parks at the grocery car, walks out of frame, grocery cart rolls towards car, and guy SPRINTS back into frame to tackle the cart. Ouch, thats gotta hurt.
13	June 30, 2000 7:11PM	liufei	"The nissan commercial with the pigeon squadron bomb a nissan from a few years back.... I always got a knack when the pigeon said ""mayday"" at the very end...."
14	June 30, 2000 7:53PM	fezo	"I'll hate myself for asking, but what do people think of the Toyota ""TV guy"" ads?

There's a couple with some cute touches but in general they are really annoying!"
15	June 30, 2000 8:00PM	bdreggors	"Yeah, shouldn't he have a gold-plated Olds?

I thought those Century commercials with the ""Buick Guy"" were good. Made me laugh on a few occasions.

The Nissan Frontier ads with that Jerry guy were pretty stupid. ""Putting 4 real doors on a compact pickup was a no-brainer."" Four huge doors and a huge cabin yet a Sliverado extended-cab has more room...It just proves that Nissan designers have no brain!

The Toyota Avalon commercial struck me as really annoying. ""Do you really need 64 crayons in a box?"" Do we really need another bad Toyota spot?"
16	June 30, 2000 8:14PM	teo	"I absolutely dislike:

* Acura commercials (They used to be good way back
in the late 80's)

* Cheap Ford Commercials (South Florida Ford dealers)

* All Toyota ads

* Nissan commercials (Specially the Xterra and Maxima) The annoying ""Cars like it ====?"""
17	June 30, 2000 9:34PM	kevm14	"I happen to get a big kick out of those Maxima ads. Too many people are unconcerned about performance, which the Maxima serves to improve upon in the mid-size sedan segment. I drive a 96 SE 5-speed myself, so when I see all the speed references, handling references, braking, mileage, or what have you, I know it's real.
And when it says cars like it - 0, well, how many midsize 5-speed sedans are there that come completely loaded, and even 17 inch wheels for under $30k (SE)? (well under $30k)
That's my point. yeah, there are plenty of cars like the GXE - I happen to hate the GXE (or really the fact that people bought it over the SE!!).
And this I can say - if you drove a 2000 SE (or even a 95-99 SE) and didn't like it, that doesn't mean the car isn't good. It probably means you do not value performance at all (did you drive to the dealer in a 4 cylinder camry or accord, by any chance?)"
18	June 30, 2000 10:55PM	bdreggors	"I think that the Maxima is a good car, but I walked away with a Regal GS. That sucker can MOVE with the supercharger! I'd say that those cars are each other's only real competition. I definetly respect the Max...

Well, now that I've plugged Buick, I'll move on.

Toyota seems to have made only a few good ads (like the 'Everyday' ones), one of which was where the guy who's busy with everything gets out of his Corolla and falls down the open manhole.

I also love the Mercedes S-Class commercial where the Mercedes people are hallmarking the COMAND system; i.e. ""if you are lost, we'll find you directions."" The last part was where a Mercedes guy said ""if you forget your wife's anniversary present...your screwed!"" I laughed a lot at that one."
19	July 1, 2000 4:46AM	markz2k	"I know exactly what you mean about the carls jr. ads. I used to go there at least 3 times a week before they started the sloppy/gross ads several years ago. I haven't been to a Carls for at least 3 years, and they're all over the place here in Irvine. Co-workers hate it if I drive to lunch cause I won't go there. (And won't go with them if that's where they're going!)Won't go to Taco Bell either, those commercials are probably even more annoying than the carls ones.

I actually emailed a comment to carls from their site once a few years back. I got a reply from someone in marketing who was pleasant about the issue, but basically said we're happy to lose a few hundred/thousand customers who don't like the ads to gain the several thousand that do like them.

And then there's the ULTRA-ANNOYING ads for Cerritos Auto square with jim varney (the Hey, Vern guy) That idiot is the only reason I need to never come close to shopping there. Yes, they got me to remember the name of their shopping center with the obnoxious ads, but they also got me to remember the ads are so obnoxious that I will avoid shopping there at all costs!"
20	July 1, 2000 11:38AM	rickabt	"Jim Varney died last year from cancer, but he still appears in commercials for this area's largest Chevrolet dealership ... rest his soul!

I've heard that he has appeared in commercials for many dealerships all across the country. I thought there was a law saying that spokespeople should use the product or service offered by the company they advertise ... Jim Varney must have a lot of cars, I guess.

I never understood the appeal of Jim Varney for a car dealership unless the dealer wanted to stimulate a response from people with bad credit.

Fran Tarkenton also speaks for a subprime-level (caters to sufferers of bad credit) lending institution called Bar None ... does that mean that Fran's financing his car at 21% interest, too?"
21	July 1, 2000 11:55AM	rickabt	"Ever since VW's catchy quirky ads have met great success, several other car manufacturers have hired similar-minded ad agencies to appeal to my age group. For example...

1.) Ford Focus hatchback ad where the fashionable young passengers exit through the hatch while the Pet Shop Boys sing ""I know it's gonna be alright.""

2.) Toyota Echo ad which features the slogan ""Is there an echo out there?"" Lotsa techno music in the background and idiot-with-Mac airbrush graphics ... this is just like the ""Turbonium"" spots from VW. Ever since the Jetta wiperblade-synchronicity spot, there has been a lot of techno music on TV ads.

3.) Toyota RAV4 commercial which features the song ""What Do I Get?"" by the Buzzcocks. C'mon, Toyota ... what's next from you? Johnny Rotten singing ""I am an anarchist/I am an antichrist!"" while revving up a Celica GT-S? Punk rock has no place in selling Toyotas!!! In the early 90's, Subaru tried to use punk rock to catch on with young buyers (""Defiant and different ... like punk rock, but it's a car!"") but this failed as well.

4.) Acura commercial featuring a collage of images and the slogan ""Engineering is our art."" The song used as the background is from a great little-known Boston band called Galaxie 500. I guess the rights to Galaxie 500 songs sell for far less than rights to well-known major-label artists. Good thinkin'! Save money! Sadly, this triumph in tasteful musical direction was followed up poorly by the lazy ""Key Largo"" CL coupe commercials. That song is so vapid and slow, it makes me think that the car is just as slow!"
22	July 1, 2000 1:13PM	markz2k	"Speaking of VW, remember their slogan in the early '80's? I do, and they were 100% correct. ""It's not a car. It's a Volkswagen."" Apparently, based on my 1980 Rabbit, the definition of Volkswagen is ""unreliable POS that spends virtually all of it's life at the dealer, starting one month after the warranty ends.""

Bitter, who me?"
23	July 1, 2000 2:30PM	pjyoung	"I can't stand the local ads (especially on radio). We've got two dealers in KC (both Chevrolet dealers) who offer the fast talking disclaimer that nobody can understand. They scream their ads, and they've offered the following.

1. $99 down, $99 dollars a month. They spend the whole ad touting this, then the fast talking starts and the ""example"" is a 2000 Cavalier with 3 payments of $99 and 57 payments of $350. What happens when the idiots who fall for this suddenly realize it's NOT really $99? Well, we have ad number 2:

2. Big Repo sale. Like new cars with used car pricing. Negotiation will not be necessary - the prices on the windows are rock bottom.

3. Then they have the Blazer ads, where the deals are for GM employees only.

4. The latest ads are the ""you waited"" as in, we said $99 a month, but YOU WAITED. We had a REPO SALE but YOU WAITED, We had Blazers for $4,000 off, but YOU WAITED. NOW - NO REASONABLE OFFER WILL BE REFUSED. Of course, they don't say what a reasonable offer is.

I hate these ads."
24	July 1, 2000 8:26PM	wenyue	"Lexus, unlike their cheaper Toyota breathern, seems like alway make good commericals.

I like the IS300 commerical where the guy black mail the boss. Like the ES300 commmerical with a guy driving around a glass building trying to charm himself (like the music especially). GS commericial with the guy messing up his shirt and putting on lipstick trying to fool his wife....

Toytoa could learn a thing or two from Lexus commericals."
25	July 4, 2000 6:54PM	andrew21	"The Viper one w/ ""Magic Carpet Ride"" playing. I'm no Viper fan, but I thought that one was fun to watch.

Other than that and a few that I mentioned before, I really don't have many opinions on car commercials because 99% are so forgettable. If you asked me 10 minutes after I watched one, I just wouldn't be able to recall the model or even the manufacturer. Yawn."
26	July 5, 2000 11:41PM	fezo	I don't know - I suppose you are right for the most part, but it just strikes me that Toyota has consistantly annoying commercials. Now if they advertised cars like they do beer, you could tell something from the ads. My personal observation there is the worse the beer the better the commercial.
27	July 6, 2000 5:10AM	jimveta	"These are some I like just because they look cool:

- The Chevy Tahoe ads for the previous model year
(I haven't seen anyone for the new ones); the
series with the morphing nature scenes, the
adventures percussive music, and ending with
the guy's deep voice ""..like a rock"". i thought
the whole series was beautiful and sort of ""awe
inspiring""

- Tundra commercial where it starts out with just
its frame and wheels on a desert flat, and as
it moves alongside various vehicles and a train,
all the parts fall from the sky to come and
assemble together to form the truck. reminds
me of the borg somehow

- VW's Vapor color beetle commercial.. just seemed
really laid back, cool, relaxing ..

- A single dodge ram commercial of it rotating on
a pedastal, morphing into different
configurations, representing it's uses with
various company logos on the truck and such..
probably strange of me to like it, but i think
it was the style.. simple, concise message, and
good deep, moving non-cheesy music.

- BMW commercials i think it was the 3-series..
just it carving the corners, intermittent
messages, no talking, good pumping techno."
28	July 7, 2000 1:25AM	dbakalar	"The VW commercials of late are by far my favorite. I like the one from a few years back w/ the two guys tooling around town, pick up the ratty looking recliner chair, only to stare at each other and set it back out on the curb. My all time favorite is the ""Mr. Robato"" commercial for the new Golf. Only because I have been guilty of doing the same thing in my '99 Golf.

Nissan Maxima commercials are cool only because of the cool music. The cars themselves are ugly as sin.

Stupidest commercials I've seen yet belong to Hyundai. A stage diving Hyundai, and the one with the guy sunbathing in his car, next to the pool, on TOP of a highrise building. Give me a break."
29	July 7, 2000 1:41AM	vqzhtr	"Like em
1) Any of the 2000 Maxima, Xterra, and Pathfinder commercials (with out the Jerry Guy). The Maxima commercials because of the upbeat music, the desert shots and because you get to focus on the car and not have to see or listen to some people in the background who you don't really care about or really have nothing to do with the commercial.

The Xterra ads because of the cool rugged shots and the Lenny Kravitz song. The Pathifinder commercial that was cool was the one where a whole bunch of Pathfinders are playing polo, that must have been hard to coordinate.

I also like the old commercials with the Z and Barbie doll and the birds chasing the Maxima.

2) The 1999 and 2000 Infiniti commericials although they may be forgettable. I think they bring more sense of luxury than most of the other luxo companies.

3) The BMW X5 commercials. They seem kind of corny with those people jumping in the creek, but I love those shots of the X5 in the woods.

4)Lexus commercial when the cop and and the owner of the RX switch places.

5) The Jaguar S-Type commercial (not the new one)

6) The VW Beetle Vapor commercial and The Jetta Commercial when the guy saves his car from the shopping cart.

7)The GrandAM commercial where the car is driving through that computerized city.

Very Funny and Hate em:
1) The Acura commercials I gotta change the channel every time I see the key in the ignition. Key largo? I thought they were suppose to inflict luxury what the hell does driving through a dump in New Orleans have to do with luxury.

2) The Honda commercial with Accord ""Going on Vacation"" it's so stupid it's funny. I don't like those commercials with the Oddy and the Dogs either makes no sense whatsoever.

3)The Saturn LS commercials. First the one where the guy in the Accord gets scared of the LS and then at the end they call it a peformance sedan HEHE me and my friends were craking up for weeks. The second one where the guy in the office says he bought a luxury car and then a saturn LS shows up. Funny again.

4)The Crazy VW Cabrio commercial thats 5 minutes long.

5)Those Mitsubishi commercials cause their all in black and white.

and Finally Toyota Commercials All boring and dumb just like the company. Don't get me started on their local ads either, I could have sworn in one of them the 4runner was going to tip over a cliff and fall."
30	July 7, 2000 1:47PM	bdreggors	"The Good:
-That 2000 GMC commercial where the Yukons drive around in formation. I love that music! Here's a tip for all the car companies out there: Formation driving gets attention!

-The new Dodge commercials, where all the cars are graced with rebates, except the Viper. It's weird, but cool.

-Cadillac DeVille and Seville commercials. Nice cohesion between graphics and sounds.

-Saturn LS comemrcial with the crazy Accord guy. I don't like it for the Saturn, but because I know that half of all drivers can relate to that guy, talking to themselves and secretly challenging others to races when they try to pass.

and a few from awhile ago...
-Mercedes M-CLass commercial from a few years ago featuring the singing baby. That ranks among my personal top ten!

-Buick full-line commercial with that ""Real Car"" ballad. It was kind of long, but good. At the beginning it showed a minivan and the voiceover, ""Is that a car? That ain't no car."" and then an SUV, ""Is THAT a car? Not a real car..."". So true...

The Bad:
-Infiniti I30 commercial. Not really a bad commercial, but it highlights the retractable sunshade. Not really an engineering breakthrough!

-Suburu Outback sedan commercial saying that the sedan has a ""decidedly uptown look"". Huge foglights, giant spoiler...doesn't bring Times Square to my mind.

-95% of all Toyota commercials. Just horrible. People would look at a Camry instead of an exploding building? The overused metaphoric tripe in the Avalon commercial? Someone actually taking a 4Runner off-road? These are hillarious...unfortunetly, that's not their aim.

And the Annoying:
-The absolute, most annoying commercial, EVER:
The current MY TOYOTA sale ads. It is the absolute worst ever. The song will drill into your head and stay there!

I don't know if these are playing anywhere else in the country, but in Tampa, Florida, we are being barraged by these ads. I turn on the radio: MY TOYOTA! I turn on the TV: MY TOYOTA! Finally, the sale was over...but wait; Turn on the TV and MY TOYOTA! Its been extended! Now I know how Noriega felt..."
31	July 7, 2000 3:09PM	fezo	"""Now I know how Noriega felt...""

Yes! Exactly!! Hee hee..."
32	July 7, 2000 6:31PM	ickes	"1. Nissan Maxima on the dry lake bed with the jet engine sound in the background.

2. VW Passat Wagon w/ the that cookie is still good under the 5-second rule.

Also like the Lincoln LS cut-less commercial with ""WOOD, LEATHER."""
33	July 7, 2000 11:25PM	dbakalar	"Ford Focus coffee drinking, rail road crossing... ""Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. DUDES!)"
34	July 10, 2000 9:55PM	denniswade	"The entire VW campaign. They're minimalist, funny, memorable and they all present a characteristic or benefit of the car in an entirely positive way. The Cabrio ad is my favorite of all -- it absolutely captures the magic of driving a convertible in the moonlight. Maximum cool!!!

I drive a Toyota (matter of fact, so does my wife and daughter), but I'm witchoo on the ads -- they stink, except for the Tundra ads, which are pretty cool -- especially the one with the big dumpster trying to parallel park.

The original GS ads (""Something wicked this way comes"") were masterful in their attempt to dissassociate the car from its put-me-to-sleep Lexus brethren, and the new GS ad with the girl who wants a ""nice caring buy who reads poetry and isn't afraid to pick a flower"" then sees her REAL blind date, is pretty cool too. But the new IS print ads with the weirdo is just dumb. Saatchi and Saatchi needs some new talent........"
35	July 10, 2000 11:21PM	rcarboni	"The Bad:

1. The two women fighting for a parking spot in their SUVs. Bad image portrayal and how many Kias did they wreck shooting that one?

2. The Lexus guy looking at his reflection while driving. Now I have associated Dork and Lexus as meaning the same thing.

3. ""Wider is Better"". Concept is Stupid.

4. Cadillac Catera. The caddy that ""zigs""??? No wonder Cadillac couldn't sell these things.

5. Honda Odyssey with the dogs. OK......

6. Nissan Maxima. It was kinda cool the first 150 times I saw it. Now I'm sick of the Who, and the Maxima.

7. Subaru Outback with Aussie guy. Ok, they're not that bad, but they are getting old.


The Good:

1. Eskimo describing animal tracks declares ""Audi"" after seeing tire tracks.

2. Jeep Wrangler being ""created"" on the mountain.

3. Tiger Woods Golf School. Has nothing to do with the car, but is good for a laugh.

4. Chrysler 300M showing old commercials of 300 product line.

5. Honda Insight. They should have put this much thought into the Odyssey ad.

6. Jaguar S-type. Great music and images.

7. Mitsubishi image ads. You want to deny it, but you know it's true. You buy because of looks.

8. The new Passat ads that have people remembering their younger days.

9. The Saturn LS. ""That's what I've been saying for years"". Funny stuff."
36	July 11, 2000 12:17AM	bdreggors	"That Paul Hogan guy is making me think that Subaru is AUSTRALIAN!

I liked the older Odyssey ad with the members of the family each being represented by a lawyer that wanted something different in the van. Much better than the Frankenstein dog-men.

I also like the new Silverado ad where the drilling guy asks the younger kid what he did with his truck and the youngster responds by saying ""I just washed it."" The owner drives it through the mud during the voiceover and at the end a coworker says ""Man's gotta protect his image""!

Just an interesting observation about truck commercials:
Silverado: ""The Truck""
Sierra: ""Professional-grade Trucks""
F-150: ""Built Ford Tough""
Ram: ""The Burden of Leadership""

Toyota Tundra: ""Just enough power for you!""

An exercise in modesty or inadequacy?"
37	July 11, 2000 2:17PM	ickes	"Agree with your comment about the ""wider is better"" It is especially stupid since the Intrigue has a wider track than the GP.

I saw the Focud ""dude"" commercial yesterday. VERY ""dud"". Ford is trying too hard to be hip.

Does anyone get Cadillac's new Fusion campaign. Not much sense there. ""Standard of the World"" was better, even though it isn't true anymore."
38	July 11, 2000 2:38PM	freddy_k	"One of my favourates - judged by the fact that I cracked up the first time I saw it - guy parks his Jetta, the sound of a rolling shopping kart, guy runs through the camera and tackles it before it hits the car. I though it was great.

Most annoying: All the new focus commercials playing cheap, cheesy music and people driving the cars all happy and stupid. Makes me ill!"
39	July 11, 2000 9:17PM	denniswade	"You have ""youth marketing"" to thank for that -- kinda like old white guys trying to be ""hip with all that jive""........"
40	July 12, 2000 1:11AM	crkeehn	Any Sesame Street fan will recognize the Honda dogs as the Wegman Weimaraners. They are used on Sesame Street both dressed up as they are in the Honda ad, and forming letters.
41	July 12, 2000 12:50PM	timothyadavis	"And, from Honda's point of view, I think that spells, ""We are selling all the Odysseys we can make as fast as we can make them, so we can do anything we like in the ads because they don't really have to sell the van anyway. So there!""

Personally, I think the ad directors saw a unique opportunity to spend some already-budgeted ad money on their wild and creative whims since the ads didn't really have to get results other than some attention and possibly an ad award (I forget what they're called, Addy maybe?)...."
42	July 12, 2000 4:06PM	crkeehn	"That may well be, but what else can you say about the Odyssey other than I got mine and you didn't, Nah Nah Nah.

Anybody with young children that one would need a van for, probably would be familiar with the Wegman Weimaraners (by the way, I did have to look up the spelling of Weimaraner.) from Sesame Street. As Sesame Street is an illusion, the parental units would make the connection that the Odyssey is also an illusion, most likely those that you think you see on the street are cardboard mockups."
43	July 12, 2000 5:21PM	mhansen1	"Last night, I saw for the first time the ad for the VW Jetta where he parks at the grocery store and walks away; then a shopping carriage comes rolling toward his car and he tackles it so it wont hit the car .... found it hilarious!

I also liked the ads for the Jeep a couple years back. Girl is suntanning on the hood at the top of the cliff while the storm cloud is raining over the overlooking city.

Very annoying plus I do not get it: the Honda Odyessey and the family of dogs ???"
44	July 16, 2000 6:33AM	rickabt	"Following the semantic dissection of the word ""is"" during the Clinton impeachment trial, Cadillac thought they were free to reinvent the word ""and."" They should have realized that the over-analysis of ""is"" was the final straw for many Americans who were growing weary of the entire proceeding, but it is just like General Motors to become preoccupied with aggrandizing trivial minutiae by attempting to add new meaning to words such as ""driver control system.""

Remember the ""Driver Control System"" of the S-10 Blazer three or four years ago? What was that?

The driver steers the Blazer with the steering wheel. The driver propels the car at varying speeds by depressing the accelerator pedal. The driver slows or stops the vehicle by stepping on the brakes. Except for cars specially equipped by driving instructors, what car doesn't have a ""Driver Control System.""

Of course, GM meant that the Blazer had eight available suspensions (of which, I only saw two on the dealership as a Chevy salesman), EVO steering (electrically variable orifice which constricts at higher speeds to restrict the flow of steering fluid), ABS brakes, VORTEC V6, and virtually everything related to the powertrain and safety systems.

Many customers actually seemed to be befuddled by all the suspension choices. It actually seemed to backfire on account of this.

Strangely enough, the ""Driver Control System"" was not mentioned in the GMC Jimmy ads."
45	July 16, 2000 6:45AM	rickabt	"""Wider is better"" has already been mentioned, but what about the Pontiac Gran Am's ads which tout the vehicle's ""Solid-Form Contruction.""

Is that what makes Pontiacs so different?

If I'm not mistaken, steel has undergone a phase change by the time it is forged. It was indeed a liquid at one time.

""Stabilitrak 2.0"" is another pompous pile of B.S. How many consumers will ever understand the different components of this not-so-unique system? As an automotive sales professional, it is my job to become familiar with the features of competitive vehicles, but I will choose to ignore ""Stabilitrak."" I suspect that the entire TV-viewing public is snoozing on this.

Of course, it is so ridiculous when you hear manufacturers proclaim these ridiculous patented ""systems"" with trademarked names as exclusive options (e.g., ""...the only car in its class with 'Stabilitrak 2.0.'"").

46	July 16, 2000 3:31PM	bdreggors	"...""Best in class"" crap. Infiniti's I30 (expensive Maxima) has the most powerful V-6 (227hp) in its class, which is entry-luxury or something like that. But what about the Buick Park Avenue with 240hp? Or the Chrysler 300M with 253hp? Those strike me as entry-luxury ($30-40K).

So is it BS? Sure is, but its not exclusive to any one company.

And one word about the ""Wider-is-Better"" thing. Of the three GM W-Body cars (of which GP is one), which is the widest? The Grand Prix, right? Nope. The Regal? Close...it's the Olds Intrigue!

Another thing that annoys me is this sponsership crap. A Coach Edition Lexus? A Nautica Mercury Villager minivan? Who buys this crap??

Plus, I've noticed that any car is now a sports car if it has a spoiler and the word ""sport"" in its name. And I mean ANYTHING, take the Dodge Caravan Sport for example..."
47	July 17, 2000 4:40AM	rickabt	"I really hate the ad from Mitsubishi in which they cite Car and Driver's choice to name their Galant as the top midsize import above the Accord or Camry; they childishly gloat ""I'm better than you are"" in a tone reminiscent of an overly ambitious, super-competitive playground hoopster ... a hero in his own mind who would wilt under the pressure of real organized competition.

I think the viewing public understands that Car and Driver's awards really mean nothing ... after all, the Chevy Malibu was the ""Car of the Year"" in 1998, but long-term tests from other mags have proved that this car is far worse than average.

I wonder what kind of people actually respond positively to this ad. Mitsubishi is probably marketing itself to sufferers of ""small-man syndrome."""

Mitsubishi is the fastest-growing Japanese car company.

Toyota Camry is the best-selling car in America/F-150 the best-selling truck.

Honda Accord is the most stolen car in America.

Only one of these makes a difference to an educated consumer. I'm also sick of the ""Car of the Year"" awards. The Lincoln LS was undeservedly the car of the year. Personally, a car like the S-Class or DeVille deserved to be. They set the standard in their respective fields while the LS is a Lincoln catch-up.

I think it's in extremely poor taste to air such commercials due to the rotten economy.

Spoiled? You don't realize what they go through. Many young girls start out desiring a pony and then get a horse and then have to take dressage lessons. They learn discipline and responsibility during the lessons, doing many grueling hours of practice, competing in events and taking care of their horses by brushing them, cleaning their hooves, etc. This develops character and humility.

If their horse is not on the parent's property, then the mother usually drives them to the barn/horse farm. Mother has responsibility to always seek out the best trainer for her daughter(s) as well as proper bridle, saddle, helmet and riding clothes. And, that is not all. It is likely that the daughter(s) are also learning tennis, golf, soccer and competing in same. It is a very trying schedule for mother and daughter(s). Tough on the mother also if 2 or more daughters have horses.

People that can afford Lexus, Mercedes, Infiniti, even Cadillac, need to see TV commercials to stimulate them into buying. Look at all the jobs created whether in the U.S. or elsewhere for global economy.

Have not seen the Cadillac Christmas commercial yet. They have not recently run the commercial with the young woman in a CTS kind of racing two guys in another car. That's neat, showing up the guys."

Lexus commercial with pony in living room is very good. But, I guess that bleeding hearts will feel sorry for the visiting little girl who throws down her small horse toy upon seeing the pony. But, think that many young girls aspire to having a real horse and then taking riding lessons and pleasure riding on the trails with their moms.

Shouldn't be offended and don't have to be wealthy to buy a pony or horse. It's the upkeep that might be a problem for some people.

Minimum for boarding a horse in my area is $300/month + periodic shoeing and vet bills. Of course if you have a farm, or a suitably large and zoned property, you can have your horse(s) in your own barn, but then have to do at least twice daily maintenance and also let the horse out in the pasture during the day.

The mini is definitely way more practical especially now that kids are involved, but still no way. Not really sure how the stigma against the mini came about.
119	December 23, 2008 11:35AM	ateixeira	Well, first the station wagon wasn't cool, then the minivan. My guess is the SUV is next. It's already frowned upon in green circles. Hummers here in the DC area are vandalized regularly.
120	December 23, 2008 1:11PM	fezo	Hey, a Miata and a minivan. You ARE secure in your masculinity! The only was you could be more so would be to add a VW new Beetle convertible to the collection....

Meanwhile, back to commercials, who the heck is teh bozo that came up with the new GM ads? The ones that say something to the effect of ""from GM. Surprised?"" to me they are saying that it's even surprising to them that GM can put out a good product. This doesn't seem to me to be the message they want out there."
124	December 27, 2008 11:58AM	lemko	"I think they're kind of stupid because my answer is ""No, I'm not surprised"" because I'm extremely happy with my GM vehicles. The ads are aimed at others who don't feel the way I do."

Hyundai had the one with the execs from Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus grumbling their name for having won the North American Car of the Year. It was decent.

My favorite was Audi's, the one with Jason Statham.

He's in the 70s and drives off in a Benz as his runaway car. Then it flashes to the 80s and he hops in a BMW. Next is the 90s, and he sees a Lexus ES and just grunts and doesn't drive it at all (HYSTERICAL). Then it finally flashes to present day and he hops in an A4, IIRC, to continue his getaway.

Funny, amusing, showed the product, acknowledges automotive history. Brilliant.

Any other favorites?"

It was for the A6, I stand corrected."

At least as I recall, Mercedes tv commercials are not as stupid as BMW which has cars sliding sideways and kicking up salt clouds apparently on salt bed lake somewhere. Last weekend, spotted a middle-age couple showing off their new Mercedes station wagon (temp license plates) at gas station in nearby little town and then slowly driving around streets.
152	March 23, 2009 6:58AM	xrunner2	"Don't see as many macho pickup truck commercials on tv as in years past. Maybe sales of these vehicles primarily for work use these days with slowing sales to guys driving to their desk jobs.

A couple of years ago, hired a contractor to do couple weeks work on the property. He brought an enclosed trailer having tools, materials and placed it in one of our parking areas. His pickup was a Ford F250 diesel duallie with 4-doors and long bed. These big duallies make Rovers, g-wagons, vans, land cruisers appear to be child's toys in comparison."

That is pretty good, but still not the imagination of the Lexus RX Christmas commercials which tug at the heart strings. Last Christmas was best of series with a flashback of young girl getting a pony, then getting an RX for Christmas currently as adult. That is marketting.

What about being a senior in a sun city area and driving a golf cart locally and a Buick Lucerne for out of area. Hey, maybe a good idea for a commercial for Buick. They could show a senior couple getting into their Lucerne in the driveway in front of the garage doors with a high-end golf cart parked nearby with clubs in it."

The RX and maybe LX have a world built around them now.

And I still can't get over a not-very-old guy who was supposed to be enthused over an ES. Give me a break.

The false machismo of the Ram ads is pretty funny. When you see someone using a huge Ram dually quad cab as a commuter, they appear anything but tough.

Lots of Jeep drivers are real off roaders too...but there's a ""look at me"" crowd which is annoying, and IMO the latest commercial slogan is aimed at. The real die-hards don't need a commercial like that.

2 outcomes, people like me that say what the ???? and the others it gets into the showroom only to leave upset when they see how much one costs.
second half is a 'hockey player' that sheepishly likes the remote open hatch available on an edge.
he is so embarrassed about making the commercial, he only shows half his face. :sick:"

The one that really gets me is the one where he says there is one Honda that Chevy can't compete with.... and then points out a Honda lawn mower. I'm not sure how Chevy thinks that will win over any current Honda customers... Honda mowers have an enormously positive reputation. If they can make cars that are as reliable and long-lasting as their mowers (they can't), then why take a chance on a Chevy?"

An open question to all to read / post on this thread ... if you were the marketing czar for GM, what kind of ads would you run?

Think about this for each brand ... Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac. Would you compare yourself to the competition, as Chevrolet is currently doing?

I'm curious .. so much of this thread is about advertising that sucks ... what you replace it with?"

I really don't know. You're really behind the 8-ball when you practically have to beg car shoppers to seriously consider your brand(s). Cadillac's ads aren't bad, but they aren't very imaginative. The rest of the GM ads are a jumbled mess because-unlike Cadillac- none of the other divisions have any idea what they are supposed to be."

There is a bank commercial that is kind of a take-off of a Lexus commercial from last year using a pony. A man has two young girls (6 years old?) sitting at a table. He asks first one if she wants a pony. She says yes and he gives her a toy model of a pony. He asks second girl, she says yes and he brings out a live pony. First girl then says to him that he didn't ask her if she wanted a real live pony. The mean man then says, ""You didn't ask"". First girl then has sorrowful expression. Got to wonder.

That was a light-hearted commercial. Kind of similar to other car makers showing a lot of customer traffic in their showrooms.

One of dumbest car commercials is that of a car crashing through the windows into the showroom - was that Mercedes? Now that does not make any sense at all, is pointless and reflects poorly on the car manufacturer involved.

The MB ad makes sense in the context of the ad copy.

It doesn't seem out of line to me. It's better than Lexus cars shown in front of pretentious shops, no matter that ""apartment and condo trash"" as someone put it, purchase a great deal of them. A good RX ad would have an affluent non-working free-spending housewife cruising between the gallery mall and the botox clinic...maybe an LS ad featuring the same driver unable to park the big car properly and destroying the wheels along the curb :shades:

It's a huge hit. The song is sort of a nursery rhyme, I think, in Portuguese."
394	July 16, 2010 5:45PM	fushigi	"The common folk have no appreciation for superior quality music and musicians.

Which is why the commercial fails. Hondas are supposed to appeal to the common person.

(I'm not going to debate ""superior quality music and musicians"" since that's subjective. One man's opera is another's hip hop.)"

398	July 26, 2010 5:54AM	lemko	I think the Kia Soul commercial with the hip hop hamsters is pretty cool with its slam on appliance-like vehicles showing other hamsters riding around in a toaster, washing machine, and a cardboard box.

400	July 26, 2010 7:24AM	roadburner	"The Toyota ad where the the geeky family tells how their Camry was passed around is unintentionally hilarious. Do you know any teenager that would give a fist pump and shout ""YES!!!"" when told that their first car would be a third-hand Camry? Or a kid who dreams of driving a new Camry Hybrid?"
401	July 26, 2010 7:53AM	fintail	"Those are amusing and creative...and I guess a Soul is less of a toaster than a Corolla. Maybe it's a blender or food processor :shades:

Getting tired of the Hyundai $199/month ads with people test driving cars and acting shocked and impressed...when the cars they are test driving are not the $199/month sweetheart fleet model Sonatas...I sincerely doubt moonroof and leather are standard on those cars."

I have a cousin who's first car was a third hand Camry. Let's just say not a car person...didn't even know how to check the oil when the light came on and it was nearly empty..."

407	July 27, 2010 5:50PM	roadburner	"That guy's laugh...the ad will become a minor cult item....but it won't help Toyota.

It kind of reminds me of those early '90s Saturn ads that appeared to portray most Saturn owners as bizarre and eccentric...
That said, this Toyota add is like a horrible car crash; you don't want to look but you can't help it."
408	July 29, 2010 7:11AM	fintail	"Doesn't that describe most Saturn owners? :shades:

The Hyundai ""uncensored"" themed ads are kind of iffy...the cars they show people driving are not the ones offered at the end of the ad. It's funny to see an ad extolling the Elantra over the Civrolla when the people shown driving and raving appear to be in a Genesis per the reverse-angled C-pillar seen in the background."
409	August 2, 2010 10:30AM	fintail	"A recent Honda ad showing a Crosstour being used as some kind of limo for ""Mr. Opportunity"" is kind of misleading, as it implies a Crosstour has actually been sold. I have seen more SLR McLarens (2) on the road here than Crosstours (1).

Hyundai ads are still bugging me...screaming about $199 leases and how an Elantra beats a boring Civrolla when the people are shown driving leather lined Sonatas and Genesis."

Haven't seen any SLR's here in Colorado, but I have spotted a few Crosstours. I suspect that many of them are the AWD variant.

The Mr. Opportunity commercials are really starting to bug me. When he was just in the showroom, I was OK with it, but now that the marketing people seem to want him to have a real life (opera? paparazzi? really?), I just get annoyed.

Where the hell is Don Draper when you really need him?"
411	August 3, 2010 6:01AM	lemko	The Crosstour and it's Acura sibling are the most hideous vehicles to hit the road since the Aztek and Element. Is Mr. Opportunity also blind?

413	August 3, 2010 10:10AM	fintail	I think I have only seen the one ZDX ad...who would buy such a thing, especially for that money? Hideous and a little dear...what a combination. Who do they think they are, BMW? :shades:
414	August 3, 2010 10:42AM	ateixeira	"""Ha ha"", all that's lacking is a grunt.

The Kia Soul ads are very cool, my son likes them and he's only 8.

Kia has the youngest demographic of any automaker last I heard. I'm sure price has a lot to do with that, but all they need to do is keep those buyers loyal."
415	August 10, 2010 6:23AM	ken117	The Hyundai ads are horrible. Honestly, I have heard The Dude one too many times. All I can say is I am so happy I have a remote. The ads actually make me think Hyundai is not a vehicle I would buy. The Chrysler ads are a close second. Of course, Chrysler could not give me a vehicle, I have owned two and I won't be fooled again. I do agree, the Soul ads are amusing.
416	August 10, 2010 7:22AM	lemko	I dunno, but doesn't Mr. Opportunity come across as something of a dork in the dance club when he has to explain to the girl what he's doing?
417	August 10, 2010 7:52AM	kplacer	But he's always been a dork. Can't see him changing now.

421	August 12, 2010 6:25PM	fintail	"I saw a Hyundai commercial lately that mentioned a ""comeback"". Wouldn't that imply past excellence, a fall from greatness, and then newfound competency? No doubt Hyundai makes some good cars now...but ""comeback"" might be overdoing it."
422	August 13, 2010 5:23AM	ateixeira	I think at one point the Excel was the #1 selling import. That quickly crashed as people figured out that they were made of recycled wood and tin foil.
423	August 13, 2010 6:57AM	fintail	"Did they sell that well before reality set in? I am too young to remembe the data from those days, but I do remember the hype and some commercials. Almost as good as the Yugo...nothing like a 3 month old car with a failed (manual) transmission.

I once knew someone who bought one of the very first Sonatas...nursed it along for a decade and by that time it looked to be junkyard quaity. Around the same time, late 90s, I knew someone with an first gen Excel who actually claimed to have good luck with it."
424	August 13, 2010 7:10AM	ateixeira	"May have been hype, indeed. Maybe best selling import in its class?

You know how it's easy to wrestle the statistics to say anything you want."
425	August 13, 2010 7:15AM	anythngbutgm	"lol, were they $3995.00 or $4995.00?

My buddy had an excel hatchback which he drove for 110 thousand miles and had very few problems with it. One that I do remember clearly though was the gearbox broke free from the floor console and you could see it from underneath the car. It was still mechanically connected and still worked though.

OK, this may not be a TV ad yet but has anyone visited the Ford site lately? This one is pretty ridiculous.

430	August 13, 2010 2:28PM	toomanyfumes	I never saw the Granada/Cadillac one, that's great. Wasn't the SNL parody about the Quiet ride of the Marquis?
431	August 13, 2010 3:02PM	roadburner	Anyone remember the Ford ad comparing the 1984 Thunderbird to the BMW 6 Series? I owned both cars at the same time and I will state without any hesitation that the 6er was worth four to five times the cost of the T Bird...

The one detail I didn't like is that they go euro and go all the way to the autobahn (sweet) and then fall back on the it's-all-that-matters-in-the-USA 0-60 figure.

0-60 sells but drag strip claims undermine the whole autobahn tuning effort."

445	September 20, 2010 11:34AM	ateixeira	"Actually, not a joke any more. The CTS-V is world-class.

I don't think all models are there yet, but that's no longer a punch line, either."
446	September 20, 2010 12:01PM	anythngbutgm	"And I agree, and that's fine but... that's one car.

By ""Standard"" I assume they are (in typical GM arrogant form) calling themselves the level at which is superior to all others, in all areas, in all categories. That's a ""Standard"" in my book and Cadillac is... to put it lightly... not there.

As good as the CTS'V is performance-wise, I don't think Rolls Royce, Bentley, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Aston, etc. look to Cadillac as superior by any means. I highly doubt Land Rover or Mercedes look at a Blinged out gangsta mobile (Escalade) as superior. And I don't think that Maybach, Mercedes, BMW look at the Deville or Seville as credible competitors. Cadillac doesn't match any of these guys in quality, features, styling, amenities, advanced technologies, nor exotic materials. Even in mainstream brands, I don't think Subaru nor Audi looks at Caddy as a ""Standard"" when it comes to AWD prowess, safety nor value.

The only other thing they built that could be looked at as a possible standard would have been the now defunct SRX but even that went from a credible barn burner to a fwd based Generi-nox and it's anemic engines are not what I would call ""Standard"" (Superior) by an means...

My point, calling one self as a ""Standard"" is pretty optimistic IMO. Especially when you've got only one model (debatable) to back up such claims. :lemon:

FWIW, ""The New class of World class"" comes off just as arrogant. One copycat ES car, a blown up Lambda clone and an overpriced, underpowered slug from Germany are not exactly leadership material... Maybe the ""New class"" in GM speak is pseudo-World Class?"
447	September 20, 2010 1:13PM	ateixeira	"Well, let's look at Audi, who is growing the fastest and poised to take over BMW in global volume...

Sure the S5 is nice, but they sell more FWD A3 hatchbacks, and don't those come with tiny base engines overseas?

Heck, arguably CTS > A4 when you consider the FWD 4 bangers they sell around the world.

I'm not saying Cadillac is the standard of the world, but I do think it's no longer absurd to say that when they compare favorably to a segment growth leader like Audi."

450	October 4, 2010 1:48PM	ateixeira	"Funny, but did you know those are Subaru's ads?

Then again, Subaru has been known as quirky and hadn't really been mainstream until recent designs. Even then, those are mainstream ""for a Subaru"", and far from generic.

They use what looks like an old Kia Optima as the starting base, but that's not really fair - the new Optima is far from conventional looking.

Still, funny commercials."
451	October 4, 2010 2:42PM	fintail	"Yep, I saw the connection, and it is pretty ironic that Subaru is now much more vanilla than at any other time in its history, while launching this campaign. Still funny though...I suspect there's a demographic who would actually be attracted to such ads.

The upcoming Optima is very flashy for a Kia (still haven't seen one in the flesh)...I don't know about unconventional though, doesn't seem to break any rules (save for the rule of good taste with the proposed faux fender vents)."

Pudgy young women and their incredibly boring parents?"

Question: Why don't these kids get a job and buy their own cars?"
456	October 5, 2010 7:59AM	ateixeira	"They went from totally polarizing to merely slightly polarizing, LOL.

Subaru, that is.

Optima has some odd angles, so I prefer the Sonata. Thing is, most people I talk to prefer the Optima. The C-pillars ended up looking like Jag's new flagship, which is a fortunate coincidence for them."
457	October 5, 2010 8:09AM	ateixeira	"Funny how a vanilla sedan can inspire so much hate.

Relax, guys, there are plenty of Aunt Ednas and Uncle Bobs out there who drive slowly from point A to point B and don't really ever screech the tires. Camry targets them and is still the #1 selling car in America.

The ad appeals to loyal Toyota owners who are middle aged because they were buying Toyota Tercels while their poor friends went broke putting GAS in their Hemi Cudas during the OPEC oil crisis.

Today they're loyal and buy Camrys again and again because Toyotas have been durable. They didn't expect that Tercel to last 200k miles, but it did.

Sure, I'd rather drive an M3. Of course. But maybe not if I was driving to the hospital with broken ribs. Toyotas have a velvet-smooth ride that actually appeals to some people.

Not everyone wants to drive a stiff sports sedan with rock-hard low-profile run-flat tires, folks!"
458	October 5, 2010 10:30AM	fintail	"I think the Sienna ads are fake cool, an ironic statement. A Sienna doesn't have ""swagger"" no matter how much a six-figure stealing marketeer claims otherwise :shades:"

467	October 6, 2010 8:40AM	ateixeira	"Those ads were definitely tongue-in-cheek, but I think that's fairly obvious.

Remember, the ad went viral - Toyota got over 7 million hits on YouTube. For a commercial, no less.

Sales skyrocketed.

Sienna played wall flower to the Odyssey for years. Last month Toyota sold 9920 of them, up about 50% from a year before (and the old model scored higher in Consumer Reports).

Honda fell way behind at 7691 sales. Grand Caravan actually came in 2nd with 8057 sales. And both had good months!

Sienna prices are up about $2000 across the board, so Toyota is selling 50% more vans at higher prices to boot.

Total cash cow.

Sorry to anyone who doesn't like the Swagger Wagon ads, but the fact is - it's probably the most effective campaign of this century. No kidding."

I always assumed they were being snarky there but maybe not..."
469	October 6, 2010 9:36AM	fintail	"Well, to be fair, the current Odyssey is ancient and in desperate need of the new model, and it is also expensive. Sienna, like the Caravan, also sells to fleets, I don't believe the Odyssey does.

They only started making them recently."

Aren't those used for some toll booths? I thought that's what they were for, no?"

479	October 7, 2010 9:58AM	ateixeira	"How about backing up that 2K increase?

My LE-8 was $25k, now they're in the $27k range.

Toyota put in a 4 banger model slotted below it in the price range, but even so, fitzmall.com no-haggle prices started at $20,999 when I last shopped and right now the cheapest van is $23,057, and that's a 2.7l 4 banger, where the old one was a V6!

Costliest one is now $41,271, and that's a street price, already discounted. They didn't break $40k after discounts before. $38-39k was loaded AWD before.

It's a pretty clear-cut $2000 across-the-board increase in price, at least. I think I'm actually under-estimating the increase, probably $2500."
480	October 7, 2010 11:24AM	fintail	I've never seen a bar code used for tolls around here, and I've never had a rental car that didn't have one somewhere on the exterior. That combined with a lack of license plate frames is usually a positive indicator of a rental.

Barcodes aren't used out here for anything other than rentals as far as I know - toll systems are RFID based and gated communities are like hens teeth. It's a hell of a coincidence that cars that are known to be fleet-dumped (boring domestic sedans, along with many Koreans and Toyotas) just happen to wear these and don't wear license plate frames."

485	October 8, 2010 12:50PM	stickguy	"depends where it is. In Atex's area, one place that I know did use them (not sure if still do) was the Rt. 40 Bridge near Havre De Grace. But, that was a big thing on the side window. ANd years ago, before EZ pass, the Philly bridges used them too.

Rentals have little tiny bar codes on the lower corner of the rear window. Probably 1/10th the size of a toll one, and in a place that would not be useful for a toll reader."
486	October 8, 2010 2:00PM	fintail	"Nope, closer to Seattle. I'm willing to wager all of them I see are rentals. Heck, I've seen used ex-rentals on dealer lots still wearing the barcode - was not uncommon a couple years ago when Hertz dumped their A6 fleet.

I've had rentals with the barcode high on the front or rear windshield too. On the 7 series rental I had last year in Germany, there was one on the trunk next to the license plate. But mostly yeah, on a rear side window."
487	October 8, 2010 6:46PM	berri	"I don't rent cars very often but I never noticed a bar code on one

I remember back in the days before barcodes, they wore rental car company license plate frames, which would be removed to be incognito. But I've never rented a car there. However, for every other car I have rented, they've had barcodes.

At home I have photos of 2 German rentals and a rental in Vegas...I'll have to look for the codes when I'm back."

My nice barcoded rentals - the normal cars I have rented didn't get me going enough to snap a pic:

Vegas - barcode horizontal low on rear quarter window

Germany rental #1 - barcode horizontal low on rear quarter door window (I actually washed this car, felt bad about dirtying it on unpaved roads)

Germany rental #2 - barcode vertical left of license plate"

I've also noticed the bar codes on most rentals. I think I've even seen them scan them with the handheld scanners when I've dropped off the car."
492	October 11, 2010 9:21AM	fintail	"I drove mine out in the desert, but didn't abuse it. I remember I got a good rate on it and was thrilled to be driving it rather than a PT Cruiser or something. About a year later a local highline used dealer had a handful of ex-fleet A6s, I remember looking at cars there, and one still had Hertz paperwork on the front seat. I bet some of those cars were beat.

I remember the 7 series was scanned when returned, but barely inspected. I had expected them to go over something like that with a magnifying glass."

500	October 20, 2010 10:59AM	ateixeira	"The IS goes up against the 3, so this is just a case of the marketing folks really not having any sort of understanding of the product. Nothing new.

As for the ES, no I wouldn't personally want one, but a couple of years ago I went to an auto show and sat in every back seat imaginable, and besides the Maybachs I saw that aren't really mainstream cars anyway, the ES was THE most comfortable. Bar none.

If you've ever had cracked ribs, like I have, you may better understand (appreciate, even) the benefits of total ride isolation. You could not have paid me to ride home in a BMW 3 series, I'd have called a cab if that's all I had access to.

The thing enthusiasts simply don't understand is that some buyers want the quiet, comfortable isolation that the ES offers. I'm not saying it's better or worse, just different. They don't try to target enthusiasts.

Marketing needs to get that memo, though."
501	October 20, 2010 11:38AM	fintail	"I'm sure that's right. I wasn't bashing the ES for what it is, but comparing it to cars that can actually be ordered to enthusiast-pleasing spec is just bad marketing.

Speaking of Lexus commercials, I wonder if they will rerun the Christmas ads showing kids of the past with their toys and the kids grown up with Lexus. Would big wheel kid actually be driving an ES and not an IS-F or something?"
502	October 20, 2010 11:58AM	ateixeira	"They should target soft/big luxo cruisers, perhaps the S80 and DTS? Not sure, as I don't shop in that segment.

Mercedes and Cadillac also had very good Christmas commercials.

At least the Christmas commercials don't insult our intelligence such as some of the commercials showing cars speeding on a salt lake, sliding sideways, etc. That type of stuff appeals to young teen-age boys, who can't drive nor have the money to purchase the car in first place."

This while walking past his dad, who is washing a ratty gen 1 Voyager.

so, the new ""hot stuff"" mobile pulls into the driveway, and it is a highlander (I was expecting the new Sienna). Talk about the antithisis of a cool set of wheels.

Pretty offensive actually, since they should tell the little brat if he doesn't like the transportation, ride the bus or ride is bike!

plus, it is counter to the swagger wagon ads, or is it only cool to be seen in a minivan if it is a sienna?

To be fair, my HS freshman daughter points out that th minivan is not cool to be seen in, but we are far from the only ones (including her friends) that have one. She would, however, prefer a nice snobby SUV of some type to be seen in."

and related to rich kids, one day (probably 4 years ago) I picked up my son after school (same HS) and there was a yellow lambo out front. Of course I mentioned it, and he knew the kid. Supposedly, the father was giving that one to the kid (a girl) to use, and getting himself a new one. No idea if that ever happened of course, but it was certainly believable."

One girl I knew, a lawyer's daughter, received a new 4 door Blazer for her birthday. That lasted about 4 months, which was the last straw for her father, and it was replaced by a Ford Maverick. I knew another girl who had a then new 4WS Prelude that was pretty nice - and so was she, she was responsible and didn't ruin the car. I knew a guy who had a new Toyota 4x4 - a big deal in a small town in the early 90s, had it for maybe 6 months before it was totaled. I can't even fathom giving a high schooler a performance car like that Lambo, insane. I too now live in an affluent area, and the main high school is about half a mile from where I live, so I see some fun stuff...but the area in general seems to have a lot of people who don't seem to have jobs who drive 100K+ cars...a sign of the new socio-economic reality perhaps.

She can borrow my Miata, which will be 7 years old by the time she drives - the HLDI rated it one of the 3 cars with the lowest insurance claims. Hopefully that means we can afford to insure it.

552	November 3, 2010 6:48AM	fushigi	"Well, not to rain on the EV parade but there are a couple of important factors to consider.

First, city cars have had only limited success in the US. And make no mistake, that's all the Leaf - or any EV - can be until the range tops at least 250MPC and charge times are reduced to under 15 minutes.

Real-world example: While I live & work in the Chicago suburbs I occasionally have to go to our downtown Chicago office. The round trip is 88 miles. The Leaf is unsuitable to this commute unless I have guaranteed access to a charger downtown. After all, the Leaf's max range is achieved with minimal accessory usage (radio, HVAC, wipers, lights, rear defrost, etc.) and that minimal usage is simply not compatible with the drive. Especially in winter since range is additionally reduced in cold weather.

Second is the price. After $7500 in government incentives (which won't be permanent) the Leaf is still over $25K for a base model. Contrast with, say, the Fiesta which starts at just over $13K or Nissan's own Versa which can be had in stripped form for under $10K. It'll take a lot of years of duty - probably more than the vehicle's useful life - to even come close to making up the difference in cost.

Don't forget the home charger needs a licensed electrician to install. Add another $1200-2000 up front for the charger & dedicated 240V circuit. Some consumers would have to add even more as they might need to upgrade their home's circuit box and possibly even the feed from the utility to the home. A 100 amp panel is not going to be able to support a home + a Leaf.

Third, if you park on the street & not in a driveway or garage, forget it. The charge cable won't reach from a house to the street and even if it did you'd have to run it across a sidewalk, which may be illegal as it could block or impede sidewalk usage by wheelchairs.

And fourth: The charger installation will take the Leaf off the list of many folks who rent. Unless a landlord agrees to subsidize the cost (and what's in it for them?), a tenant would be stuck paying for the charger & either leaving it or paying for it to be removed when they move.

The Leaf will sell. There are some consumers who are homeowners with garages who have the income and value assumed eco-friendliness over cost. But as a value proposition, the Leaf fails.

The above are issues for all EVs, but specific to Nissan there's also some history to consider. Nissan has not previously supported their own hybrid particularly well. After being on the market for over 4 years, the Altima Hybrid is still only available in a handful of states."
553	November 3, 2010 12:17PM	stickguy	"they always seem to make a lot more sense to me for commercial use. The post office is the perfect situation. Central parking every night, and not many miles of all around town driving.

I am sure other municipal services would fit in the same catagory.

But, for normal users, very limited, and you would have to have another car (or easy access to one).

I suppose if you live in the city and mostly stay local, it would be fine (with a garage to charge it) as long as you don't mind renting whenever you need to go someplace out of town.

Now, stupid commercials of pickups in desert, kicking up dust, sand, driving over rocks can kind of make sense for potential buyers of farmers, ranchers. But, how many Mercedes drivers will want to drive in dust, sand, slide sideways. Honda, Mercedes commercials appeal to teen-age boys who cannot afford these new vehicles. Mercedes needs to make commercials showing their products in backgrounds of situations of their actual customer segment.

MB could do commercials of both men and women, doctors, lawyers, indian chiefs (casinos), business owners coming to their offices/businesses and parking their MB in prominent spots. Also, driving to country club, fancy restaurant, resort, etc. And of course, driving up a long driveway to their large house, parking in front in circular driveway with fountain in view."

These guys could have attributes that these women like and the women keep and support them. Maybe some of them are house dads also.

Anyway, Mercedes commercials are stupid and insulting to the vast majority of their existing and potential customers. Who in their right mind would drive a Mercedes on dry lake bed, kicking up dust, driving/sliding sideways. These commercials depict Mercedes drivers as dopes."

Maybe your area is different.

Who is insulted by a car flying around on an empty lake bed, unable to harm anyone? Really? I can't name them. Judging by the ability MB has to sell each and every one of the $60K-$200K++ performance cars it brings to this continent, there might be some appeal to showing a machine of that marque in a show off setting. And judging by healthy sales of more sedate MB offerings, the stuffed suit and McMansion crowd isn't offended either.

If I want to see stupid, it's claiming a kid who was into bikes would somehow be into Lexus ES when he is a 30-something, or how being a spoiled princess girl who now drives an RX is somehow a positive aspiration."

In about 2-3 weeks we should see Lexus roll out their latest version of Christmas commercials. Maybe they could extend the story line after Christmas morning showing the wife with the RX at the riding stable. That would be good with a snow scene and the wife bringing the horse next to the RX. Borrow a little from the Bud Clydesdales walking in the snow."

Now, Citroen could legitimately show a commercial of a Citroen driving hilly, mountainous gravel roads kicking up dust and doing a lot of sideways sliding. That would be believable if run in Europe where citizens appreciate watching that kind of driving."

As if there weren't enough issues with space, we stopped in Illinois to visit a Navy buddy of my dad's. While there, the folks bought an old milk can to take with us - so I had to share space with that, as well!

The Highlander is a good seller because it does exactly what it's intended to do, get the family back and forth from their destination in comfort, reliably, and while getting very respectable (if not class leading) fuel mileage.

It's been Toyotas mission since the beginning. And in typical Toyota fashion, cars like the Highlander are designed because Toyota understands its intended market and more or less... nails it.

I'm an enthusiast and Toyotas do very little to crank up my excitement meter, but if my wife wanted a Highlander as a commuter and we had kids, I would certainly give it a chance. Against its competitors I think it stacks up extremely well. :shades:"

796	January 21, 2011 7:04AM	anythngbutgm	"Hyundai was foolish and short-sighted enough to brand it as a Hyundai. Didn't they learn anything from the Phaeton fiasco?

So do you think that Hyundai should have started a whole new brand name just to market the Equus (Not a fan of the name btw...)? I can see some merit to that idea but with partial ownership of Kia taking up the lower market, the goal of Hyundai seems to be moving upmarket with offerings like the Equus to establish real credibility in the segment just as Lexus did in 1990.

Or... do you discredit this model for the fact that it's not a domestic nameplate...

The thing about the Phaeton that was short-sighted was the fact that VW was pitching a vehicle based on an Audi as an alternative to none other than... the Audi A8. This was due to infighting between the Audi/Porsche/VW management which never seems to be in agreement IMO.

Also, VW went even further trying to differentiate the Phaeton and the Audi with a brand new engine family (""W"" series, in the case of the Phaeton a W8) which was really no better than the tried-and-true, time-tested (say that 5 times fast ) 3.0l V6 and excellent 4.2l V8 (Wards best winner) in the Audi. And if I recall correctly, the W8 was terrible gas mileage wise...

I predict the Equus will fair better than the Phaeton. Could be in for a surprise. :shades:"
797	January 21, 2011 8:05AM	lemko	"Why didn't they simply follow Lexus' lead? They didn't market their flagship as the Toyota LS400 though the same model was know as a Toyota in the JDM. Heck, Mazda proposed its own luxury brand Amati in the early 1990s. The idea was shelved when the economy soured. One result was the rather attractive 1992 Mazda 929 which was supposed to have been an Amati.

""Equus"" alone is a terrible name as it literally means ""horse."" It also conjures up the bizarre play by that name and the less weird movie starring Richard Burton. Maybe they should've called this car the ""Genesis (some alphanumeric)."" It would've been a lot better than ""Hyundai Equus.""

I'm glad the domestics didn't come out with something like this. A bland body with a grotesque front end is something they don't need. If this had been a Caddy, Lincoln, or Chrysler, the critics would've slammed it unmercifully. You, yourself, would've had a field day laughing at the folly of the domestics trying to compete with M-B, BMW, Audi, and Lexus with something as silly as the Equus. If Cadillac wants to pursue a flagship, it should be something like the V-16 concept. If Buick wants to beat the Equus, it can simply build one of its upscale Chinese versions here. I've seen pictures of the Chinese LaCrosse and it's darn nicer looking than the Equus!

The Phaeton is also much prettier than the Equus. It's just sad they called it a VW Phaeton. If you thought the W-8 was complex, the W-12 was fiendishly complex. I pity anybody who bought a Phaeton with either of these engines. They would be repenting their sins if and when something goes awry."

Keep in mind these are very low volume cars, but it already has.

Comparing first months for sale in the USA, Equus did about triple the volume of the Phaeton (and no, that's not saying much).

Equus' first month also beat the Phaeton's 2nd month (after supply had a chance to ramp up) by about 50%.

I see it more as a chauffer-driven limo, though, vs. a large luxury car. The [non-permissible content removed] child of a Mayback and a Lincoln Town Car, perhaps.

Hyundai could do volume if they target fleets."
799	January 21, 2011 8:18AM	anythngbutgm	"So it sounds like the styling is your biggest criticism of the big Hyundai then...

I can understand that but when we look back on the LS400, it had a pretty similar profile as well. No crazy angles, no racy wings or lower cladding, just a classy, purposeful look similar to what Benz had been doing with the E-class up until then.

Your right though, that grill has been met with some serious criticism. either people love it for it's originality or hate it for it's ""in-your-face"" appearance. I personally like it, it's not a Japanese looking design and I can easily identify it as a Hyundai product.

You are also correct about the complexity of the ""W"" engines. I think VW has pretty much abandoned the family... I think they turned out to be pretty reliable though, not much in the way of recalls if I remember."

To be honest, I think it needs a non caucasian person, although I do think the group is starting to work well together.

Episode 9
The TV version was about 45 minutes long."
834	January 25, 2011 6:41PM	fintail	"It's not a bad show...not as polished as the original of course, but it has to have a tiny budget in comparison, and is still brand new. The early days of TGUK were less than awesome as well.

I don't even mind the hosts...a driver, a kind of pseudo-redneck wannabe hipster, and an east coast funnyman...they've had their moments. I don't know if any racially based cast changes would change anything."

The last 2 episodes were pretty good, so I am looking forward to next season."
836	January 25, 2011 7:23PM	fintail	"The truck episode and the ""American car"" themed one were pretty good, even if the latter was a take-off of a UK show. It can be good for a laugh, and really, there aren't a lot of car themed shows out there to begin with. Perfection isn't expected.

I predict the demographics of the UK are pretty diverse too...gotta pick the best candidates above all."
837	January 26, 2011 8:40AM	ateixeira	"It is definitely getting better, showing signs of promise.

I think the dialogue is still too slow, there are lots of dead spots. It's as if they were waiting for a laugh track, except we don't hear laughing.

Foust is fine, and it's good to have a driver among them.

Ferrara is funny. He pulls off the East Coast psuedo-mafia humor.

Rutledge struggles, IMHO. It's just not his best format. He's funny, but a lot of the long, awkward pauses seem to be with him smiling in front of the camera. The southern-boy schtick can work, but it needs polish."
838	January 26, 2011 9:22AM	michaellno	"Re: TG US.

I've read all the columns and comments from the masses stating how TG US will _______ (fill in with your vitriolic adjective here) when compared to the _________ (use positive adjective) TG in the UK.

I have not made a comment on this before now because I wanted to watch all of season 1 before rendering an opinion.

Hosts: Being season 1, I think that the interaction between the hosts got better as the season progressed. It's important to remember that TG UK has been around for, what, 8 or 9 years? Easy to have a comfortable relationship after that much time. I did see some improvement as the TG US season went on. I saw quite a difference in the interaction in the studio as opposed to when they were out on a challenge. I suspect this will get better with time, assuming there is a 2nd season. I think the biggest difference between the hosts is more linguistic .. can't imagine Tanner calling Rutledge a ""heartless [non-permissible content removed]"" or some such British phrase.

Cinematography: About par with TG UK - this is one of the big reasons I like both shows so much. The camera angles and editing are first rate in both shows. I particularly liked the scenery in the Alaska episode.

Stig: The US show doesn't use The Stig as well as the UK show. Would love to hear Adam say something like:

""Some say his driving gloves are made from pork rinds ... and that kindergarten teachers run from him when he removes his helmet. All we know is .... he's called The Stig!"".

Plus, they need to involve him in some of the challenges and/or races. Again, jury is out and we'll see what happens in season 2.

Cars: Would have preferred that TG US focused more on US hardware than on Lambo's, Aston Martins and Ferraris. Yeah, they had the Raptor and the Viper, but that was about it for the formal road tests. Would have been much better for Tanner to have driven a Corvette to Vegas when racing Rutledge rather than the Ferrari California.

Challenges: Not much difference between the shows in this respect. My wife, who has only watched part of an episode or two of both versions, commented that the ""Moonshiners Challenge"" reminded her of the TG UK episode where the boys flew to Miami, bought junkers for $1K or less, then drove them to New Orleans. No originality in that respect - again, there needs to be more Americana infused into what they do.

Overall, I guess I'd give season 1 of TG US a B-. Certainly room to improve, but better than some of the c**p that ends up on TV. And, hey, it's better to have TG US than not, eh?"
839	January 26, 2011 10:15AM	ateixeira	"Nice review. I totally agree they could feature the Stig more.

I am the US Stig, by the way."
840	January 26, 2011 4:56PM	explorerx4	"Good post. I would give the show a C+.
Sometimes, it does seem like a car commercial or infomercial.
The episodes are very uneven.
I do like the celebrity drive segments, because they actually care about how they did their lap compared to the other celebrities.
Personally, I think the 'Stig' is Paul Tracy."

I do like the celebrity drive segments, because they actually care about how they did their lap compared to the other celebrities.

One big thing to remember is that TG UK is publicly funded, whilst TG US is driven by commercial revenue, so the boys in the UK can say pretty much whatever they want. MB does some serious advertising on TG US, so one wonders what would happen to the ad revenue if the TG US hosts were to trash an MB in a review.

Big Star / Small Car: I'm OK with the SX4 being the car (again, would have been better if it was from a US manufacturer), and I think that the pre-lap interviews were good. Nice that all three hosts were involved, and that they tried to match the personality of the host to that of the guest. This segment, too, should get better with time.

Was completely shocked to learn that Michelle Rodriguez didn't even have a drivers license when she was cast for the first ""Fast 'n' Furious"" movie."

The show does have a bit of an identity crisis."

The show does have a bit of an identity crisis.

I don't think either the Fiesta or Cruze were available yet when filming was done last summer.

With regards to an ""identity crisis"" - not sure what you mean by that? You mean, does it want to be its own show or simply mimic TG UK?

As the season progressed, I think they started to get a feel for what they were trying to do.

However, if there is a 2nd season, they need to focus on the following:

1) More Stig!
2) More American cars - tested, used in challenges and races

The awkwardness of the hosts in the studio should ease up as they spend more time together."

I'll admit, that was a bit sad, but how many GM cars from the 60's, 70's and 80's are sent to the wrecking yard every year?

Just because this one car met its demise in a public way, you want to castigate the whole show?

There was another episode where each of the hosts had to pick a former GM model to be resurrected. One chose a Fiero (V6 GT w/ manual), another a '72 Cutlass coupe (350 w/ automatic) and the third chose an early 90's Buick Roadmaster Estate (with the 5.7L V8)."

852	January 29, 2011 6:15AM	fushigi	Well, it's not like TG UK always uses English cars. They're currently using a Kia.
853	January 29, 2011 7:31AM	michaellno	"Well, it's not like TG UK always uses English cars.

What English cars? MINI is owned by BMW, Rover by the Chinese. I don't think there is a domestically produced small 4-door saloon or hatch produced by an English manufacturer."
854	January 29, 2011 8:50AM	fushigi	"Still, the point is that ""Top Gear US"" is actually ""Top Gear"". I don't think they need to favor domestic brands at all times or even most of the time. Doing so would not only disrespect the rest of the world's automakers it would make the show come across as discriminatory v. just biased.

They already have a rather heavy US-slant in the comparison segments; they don't need to carry that over into all aspects.

And in a way it's a good thing to focus on less popular brands. It gives the brand exposure (I've little doubt the car was provided by the manufacturer) and should squash any notions about the show being a popularity contest.

If anything, given the advertising support, I'm surprised they aren't driving a small Mercedes."

916	February 25, 2011 8:13AM	lemko	...the commercial with the man wearing a chest carrier with a baby in it looking at a VW Jetta? I don't know what kind of guy would wear such a device except for one who is absolutely terrified of his wife and whose manhood is kept in a jar by the same woman. It certainly doesn't inspire me to buy a Jetta if it's the preferred conveyance of emasculated men like the one in the commercial.
917	February 25, 2011 8:28AM	fintail	Well, a Jetta isn't exactly the most masculine vehicle on the road, I will say that much.
918	February 25, 2011 9:29AM	ateixeira	"Funny and ironic. Nice ads, they got my attention, that's for sure.

And what was Mitsubishi thinking, by the way? I heard about the virtual test drive and laughed.

The 2nd ad seems to target Toyota/Lexus, and it's also effective.

Kudos to the ad guys. They definitely will appeal to the target demographic (I jokingly refer to them as the Neanderthal Male)."
919	February 25, 2011 4:17PM	fushigi	Well, during the online test drive, available slots filled up every day the offer was on, including the couple of added days. So from a PR perspective it was quite successful. And so far Mitsu seems pleased with the initial sales of the Outlander Sport (they're specifically going to move OS production to the US) so it must have gotten the desired sales traffic follow-through as well.
920	February 25, 2011 4:19PM	ateixeira	"Yeah, I heard they would phase out the Galant and build the Sport there instead, maybe other small cars too? I wonder if they'll sell enough volume for a whole plant. Probably, if they build for export as well.

A neighbor bought a black one, mom in her 40s."
921	February 25, 2011 6:29PM	fushigi	"The manager of the local pizza/pasta joint bought one in blue to replace her Endeavor. At the Chicago Auto Show, my wife was shopping for a compact sedan to replace her '01 Elantra. We won't buy for at least 6 months, but most of the compact sedans she just didn't care for. That included the Cruze & new Elantra - both of which were previously on her short list. The Kizashi, Impreza, Sentra, Mazda 3, and pretty much every other make of compact sedan (or small mid-sizer) had some things she didn't care for. Ditto the sub-compacts though those mostly because they feel cramped.

Surprisingly, the Outlander Sport & Tucson were her favorites. Doubly surprising on the Tucson since she panned it at last year's show."
922	February 27, 2011 8:54AM	ateixeira	"I just test drove a Kia Sportage (its twin) with my brother and we both liked it more than expected.

The kicker - price was $19.2k!

Undeniable value."
923	March 4, 2011 9:32PM	fintail	Watched TV for 45 mins tonight, saw the Lexus CT commercial 3 times. We get it - you have a new car that is marginally less boring than the rest of the lineup. I don't know if the economy is ready yet to make a Prius related vehicle that can get near 40K to be a mass market item.
924	March 7, 2011 8:55AM	ateixeira	"The sudden 33 cent surge in gas prices won't hurt in terms of timing.

They sure as heck got lucky."
925	March 7, 2011 9:09AM	lemko	...those who panic and buy, say a Corolla, to replace a huge SUV because of escalating fuel prices soon regret it. They've become accustomed to the comfort and capabilities of a larger vehicle and aren't going to be happy with a much smaller one. Worse yet, one trades in a paid-off vehicle and now has a car payment on top of the higher fuel costs. Even worse if one trades a vehicle still being financed and find he's upside-down.
926	March 7, 2011 9:16AM	ateixeira	Agreed, the vehicle still has to meet your needs. A Highlander hybrid would be a more reasonable step-down, or at least an Equinox or something.
927	March 7, 2011 9:50AM	fintail	"Indeed, they hit the jackpot. Co-worker just bought a loaded Prius. She claims she got it for 4K under sticker, but the dealer told her they were going to increase prices soon. Amusing.

The Mountain Dew CT was nowhere to be seen last time I drove by the local dealer, maybe it sold? I'm actually marginally curious about that car, as in my eyes it is developed to give the brand more exposure in Europe."
928	March 7, 2011 10:28AM	ateixeira	I dunno, Europe is in love with diesels. This won't do nearly as well there.
929	March 7, 2011 11:16AM	fintail	"They have only one diesel model for Europe, and few buy it either.

Now if the CT was a diesel hybrid using the engine from their diesel IS, I'd be looking seriously at it."
930	March 7, 2011 12:12PM	ateixeira	"I've wondered about the same thing.

Diesels aren't too happy starting and stopping constantly, but the potential fuel savings are great. Diesels are ideal on the highway, while hybrids do better in the city (and highway gains are negligable). Combine both, voila, best of both worlds."
931	March 7, 2011 12:19PM	fintail	"I think there must be some electrical incompatibility with diesels and hybrids - as none seem to be on the market anywhere. Shame - you'd get 60mpg out of one easy, I bet.

Either way, for whatever reason, the CT might be the Lexus I dislike least."
932	March 7, 2011 12:26PM	ateixeira	"I think they are cost-prohibitive.

Each on its own adds a couple of grand (at least) in cost. Together you're talking about $5-6 grand more.

Hard to make that up, though range would be incredible.

CT to me is a bit odd looking, I guess it has character, I'll give 'em that.

I understand the appeal of hybrids but most do not appeal to me. I'd rather have an IS-F or even an IS350 AWD."
933	March 7, 2011 12:42PM	lemko	Interesting. I'd like to see somebody put together a diesel hybrid just to see what the range/MPG would be. I recall VW Rabbit Diesels being rated at 50 MPG in 1980.
934	March 7, 2011 12:43PM	roadburner	"Agreed, the vehicle still has to meet your needs.

People panic and just HAVE to buy a fuel efficient car- and usually the math doesn't support their frantic decision. For example, I saw a nice 2010 Mini Cooper equipped just the way I'd want one(except that it had a big hole in the roof :mad: ). I could probably trade my MS3 and wind up paying @$10000 OTD. The Mini averages 39 mpg while my Mazda returns 23.5 mpg. Driving 16000 miles annually with gas at $4.00 per gallon I would save $95 per month. However, assuming I paid cash for the MCS I would have to drive the car for almost nine years before I broke even(10000/95= 105.26 months, or 8.77 years."
935	March 7, 2011 12:43PM	slorenzen	"""I don't know what kind of guy would wear such a device except for one who is absolutely terrified of his wife and whose manhood is kept in a jar by the same woman.""

Or, he's not concerned about what other people think of him."
936	March 7, 2011 12:51PM	fintail	"Do diesels really cost that much more, or is it just a markup a few makers use? They seem to have marginal if any price differentials in Europe.

If gas was $10/gallon, I wouldn't want those gassers for daily use. IS-F is the one I'd want too, but maybe not in the future, and not at its MSRP.

Co-worker who bought a Prius traded in a several year old MDX that she broke even on...claims payment stayed the same, but she says she'll be saving a couple hundred a month at least in gas. Maybe a lot of these soft road poser SUVs aren't really needed after all."
937	March 7, 2011 12:53PM	stever	"Driving 16000 miles annually with gas at $4.00 per gallon I would save $95 per month.

On the other hand, Saudi Arabia could pull a Libya and the price of oil could go to $200 a barrel and gas could double to $8 a gallon.

All of a sudden your payback is 4.5 years.

Sounds like the makings for a good car commercial - some AK47s, exploding oil wells, and a Prius cruising along in the background."
938	March 7, 2011 1:39PM	lemko	Actually, it would be the chatter of AK-47s, exploding oil wells, and then...the cheerful ring of a bicycle bell as a man pedals by on a Schwinn in that scenario.
939	March 7, 2011 1:59PM	ateixeira	"It's harder to meet CARB emissions, so diesels that meet US standards cost more.

Lots of car makers have engines in Europe that they can't sell here without a particulate filter, for example Subaru.

A poor man's MDX option would be a Kia Sorento 4 cylinder. You can even get a manual transmission IIRC. No 3rd row with the 4 banger, but I doubt the MDX owner used it anyway.

I tend to look for fuel efficiency, but the most efficient vehicles that meets my needs. Not a miser that doesn't."
940	March 7, 2011 2:38PM	stever	"It's harder to meet CARB emissions, so diesels that meet US standards cost more.

And yet the car companies have managed with gasoline CARB requirements, plus removing lead from gas, plus the CAFE standards, and maybe E15 next.

Maybe people in the US just don't want them. :shades:

What Would It Take for YOU to buy a diesel car?"
941	March 7, 2011 3:21PM	fintail	"Do the emissions add-ons really cost those thousands per vehicle?

No doubt the average MDX owner doesn't use the seating or AWD. The newbie Prius owner I know seems happy so far. I wonder when those will be in commercials again."
942	March 8, 2011 9:57AM	ateixeira	"No, I meant cumulative. Diesel blocks are beefier and generally cost more. Plus, remember these are turbocharged and intercooled. Then add to the extra cost of the particulate filters. Figure a total premium of a couple of grand.

Hybrids need pricey batteries, so a couple more grand.

Total maybe $4-5k over a conventional gas engine. Just a guesstimate.

That's not much on a luxury car, maybe 10% or so, but for a compact you're adding a significant % to the purchase price."
943	March 8, 2011 10:42AM	anythngbutgm	Doubt Toyota wil be spending the money on advertising the Prius. With 4 dollar gas coming, the things will sell themselves... :shades:
944	March 8, 2011 12:24PM	fintail	It seems ads for them died off when gas was cheap...Toyota might need to remind people they exist, as if driving behind one merging onto a highway isn't enough :shades:
945	March 8, 2011 12:25PM	fintail	Well, to be fair, I was originally thinking of a diesel hybrid CT...it costs enough as to where a few grand won't kill it. Too bad the Germans haven't made that, all of their hybrids are gas too. Maybe there's just a catch somewhere that makes it not work.
946	March 8, 2011 2:04PM	ateixeira	I'm not sure diesels adapt as easily to the constant start/stop cycles.

Now, I am confident of this. If I ask teen-age boys in neighborhood about Mercedes commercials and cars throwing up sand, sliding sideways, they will say they like and approve.

Nah. When you consider all the seniors and golden seniors driving Caddies in FL, AZ, CA, what possible use would be AWD? These folks, who only drive maybe a few times a week only need RWD. I see some of these seniors in my area with padded top Caddies. Must be a lucrative aftermarket for somebody putting on these tops. Never did understand the WHY of padded tops."
1009	May 13, 2011 6:52PM	xrunner2	If Jay Leno did an extended interview on the streets in LA about FWD, RWD, AWD of people of all ages, they would not even know what he was talking about. Most people don't know jack about it and only look at other attributes when picking a car.

I don't like in a snowy area either, but lots of AWD highline cars here.

Padded tops - chic among the toupee set in the 70s, some people never move on from what they see as a golden age. You see it in the way some people maintain their facial hair, hairstyles, and clothing, too."
1011	May 13, 2011 7:32PM	xrunner2	Our president should come out against awd vehicles in areas such as FL, AZ south, CA, and similar climate areas, etc. These cars waste fuel by carrying extra weight, friction of moving parts and thus poorer gas mileage. Unless you are driving a lot on snow, ice for a good part of year or drive on dirt or gravel roads, awd is stupid.
1012	May 14, 2011 4:56AM	fushigi	"The ""waste fuel"" argument doesn't hold as much water as it used to. Modern AWD/4WD systems stay FWD-biased and shift power to the rear wheels when needed (or told to); as such they impose minimal penalties. Examples: Honda CR-V 4 cyl 2WD: 21/28/24 city/highway/combined; AWD: 21/27/23. So just 1 MPG loss in non-city driving. Mitsubishi Outlander V6 2WD: 19/25; AWD: 18/24. Again, just a 1 MPG loss. Explorer V6 FWD: 17/25/20; 4WD: 17/23/19 so a loss of 2 highway but just 1 overall.

So, worst case is still under a 10% fuel economy penalty but 2 of 3 are under 5%. You driving style will have a greater impact on fuel economy than AWD's overhead."

Also keep in mind that location - very, very mild climate.

Ask someone in Vermont and he might not know what FWD is at all, because they often would not even consider a vehicle without 4/AWD."

Lexus had 37 days supply, though. And that was April 1, it's probably gone waaaaaaaaaay down.

Lexus absolutely humiliates Audi in sales per dealer, 89 vs. just 36 in March 2011.

Audi had 31 days' supply as of May 1, 2011.

Lexus? 32 days. A virtual tie. Whoop-de-doo.

So the Audi ad is pure nonsense.

And each Lexus franchise sold 76 cars despite the shortage, vs. just 36 for Audi.

Another important factor to remember - Lexus dropped incentives for that month, and they may bring them back.

So basically dealers are selling every Lexus they can get their hands on right now, even without discounts."
1019	May 18, 2011 11:09AM	fintail	"Lexus has pretty much always outsold Audi in this market (and pretty much none other outside of this continent) since the dawn of time, hasn't it? I don't see how this is news or controversy.

I haven't heard of anyone actually lining up for any Lexus save for the CT, and the market for that isn't huge or mainstream. Shortage of what model? Seems to be plenty hanging around the dealer near me."
1020	May 18, 2011 11:32AM	ateixeira	"Those are nationwide numbers. Of course we'll see regional variances.

Overall Lexus dealers have about half as many cars as they'd probably like to have. That hurts sales because then you may not see the color or options you want in stock.

So in that manner yes, overall supply is short."

Recent sales drops have been due to the tsunami, lack of supply, and elimination of incentives due to the lack of supply.

Face it, you don't like the facts you saw in that chart, so now you are spinning them.

And yes, I'm sure M-B sold more than Lexus worldwide when you count all the taxis in the middle east. :P"

What are these cars, and what are customers buying to make up for it? Other than the CT, I can't imagine any Lexus model having any kind of wait at all. Aging, boring, invisible lineup, while the competition becomes more dynamic and has sales and market share gains to back it up.

When Lexus Camrys are counted, I have no problem counting Sprinters...

NA is the only market where Lexus is even a real player."

Lexus dropped incentives sharply, but the numbers don't lie, a 32 days' supply is not exactly stagnant. Look at M-B....

Audi has no share at all before, so there was nowhere to go but up.

Edit: to add, more importantly, that the Audi ad actually shows a guy climbing out of a BMW X3. Well, the new X3 is here, and more in demand than any Audi model.

The irony...."

My wife's ES300 still has more than enough power to get me in trouble as does my C70. They both provide the function for which they were bought. In my opinion, and my opinion only, I wouldn't have a MB if one were given to me. It would go straight to Carmax for their offer. But that's just me.

One Toyota dealer said he thought early in April that he would run out of vehicles by the end of July, but now believes he will scrape through until full production resumes at Toyota plants later this year.""

I can't see it that way when there is less supply - but still a month's worth of surplus. That's not a shortage. Any supply issues are not very significant."
1043	May 23, 2011 1:03PM	stever	"Yeah, I'm sure they (and their suppliers) are just loving not being able to get stuff in the pipeline. These are commodity products, not something to try to sell in limited editions to create some kind of cachet.

On a more serious note, that's a good question. Sales v. year-ago sales for Toyota will be colored by the UA issue affecting last year's sales.

Nissan is winning big because they don't depend nearly as much on production in Japan. Perhaps Carlos ""le cost cutter"" Ghosn phased out expensive Japan-built parts?

Dodge tends to market toward the ""Neanderthal Male"", as I like to call it, so it's no wonder those ads got your testosterone pumping."

I would need to special order it and it would take 60-90 days.

It took me a while to find the car with the right price

The car will be factory ordered

In the LA area might be tough because I also asked for their quotes for the IS250 with F-sport package and their prices are significantly higher.

Generally sounds like prices are up across the board, and people are having to wait for factory orders, plus this is for an old model that traditionally isn't even in high demand.

Consistent with a 32 day supply of cars, so no surprise, to me at least."

St. Louis was a 13 hour drive for me, and I was able to find an AWD in sunny Florida with a five hour drive...not as good a ""deal"" but the hassle factor of driving, staying overnight, etc.. just made the Florida dealer make sense. If you contact him, tell him the girl from Florida recommended him!

Lexus in the Houston area will not budge on their pricing right now. Supply and Demand

We moved on and got the 2011 Buick Enclave CXL-1 instead.

I found one two hours from my location (Charlotte, NC)

they didn't tell me the color choice avail to me

when I tried that price at the other two dealers in my area, they wouldn't budge for it....

seems very hard to negotiate to that price range. Anyone have recently purchased this car in Raleigh area? Which dealer is better in this area? I am willing to drive several hours if I can get a good deal.

You complain about an aged lineup, true, but you yourself excluded their only new model from this discussion (CT200h).

Supply of old models is short, supply of new models is non-existent. That one guy ran out and bought an Enclave.

You are so blindly biased, it's ridiculous."
1067	May 24, 2011 12:42PM	fintail	"I am not the one who picked that one case as an example.

What sales volume was the CT ever expected to have anyway? Never meant to be the leader, just a new model after the HS failed so loudly. And I have mentioned the CT in this case numerous times, and you know it.

Supply of old models is shorter, but there are no empty lots. Dealers can play hardball all they want, some will win at it, some won't. I see nothing showing the SINGLE new model was going to be a significant part of sales to begin with.

Lexus has a boring aging lineup that primarily appeals to people who don't really care much for cars or driving or being alive. The competition has capitalized on this. Deal with it."
1068	May 24, 2011 1:17PM	ateixeira	"HS outsells the MKZ hybrid, it's closest competitor, 2 to 1. So the Lincoln is twice the failure...LOL.

And what about the Germans? They are now launching their own hybrids left and right, after swearing up and down diesels were sufficient. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em? They are all following Lexus. Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.

No one has truly figured out how to sell a luxury hybrid. Let's see if the CT can break that pattern. Or anything else for that matter.

Of course there are no empty lots, but the selection is dwindling and of course that affects sales. You can't deny this is a clear case of supply and demand.

That last sentence sums up your biases nicely.

Never mind the LF-A, or the IS-F that just HUMILIATED Mercedes' AMG models on the Lightning Lap. I bet you'd still buy the slower car.

Let's go ahead and stereotype all Lexus buyers while we're at it. Just goes to show how few of them you know.

You asked for examples and I offered you a dozen or so (edit: 15 examples actually). Every one of those examples directly contradicts what you've been saying."
1069	May 24, 2011 1:57PM	fintail	"Lincoln hasn't succeeded at much lately. Not the best example. But if something like Nissan is ""stealing"" sales...not a good sign. Also wonder how many HS were given away in loss leading leases several months ago. It failed, deal with it.

Diesels have been sufficient everywhere but here. Maybe a reason why Lexus is so invisible in the rest of the developed, or even more developed, world. Where is someone imitating Lexus, which models are copies?

A fun debate could be had about how much of a luxury car a 30K hatchback CT really is...

LF-A - grossly overpriced, not a regular production car, irrelevant. IS-F, beat who, by what, when? CTS-V has beat some too, so what?

I don't know every Lexus driver, but there are an awful lot of them in my area, and they don't seem to be very enthusiastic. I go to a MB club show every year here, haven't seen any local Lexus clubs.

I didn't see any examples of actual shortages, sorry. Just dealers playing games or someone whining because they couldn't get a sport trim package on a lowline model (typical poser rofl) in a weird color right off the lot. Nothing proven, just excuses for arguably the most boring brand on the planet."

The Durango and Jeep GC look better to me (never thought I'd say that) but I worry a bit about reliability. The wife unit had a '96 Sebring Conv. that was in the shop a lot; kind of left a bad taste. And my experences with GM was much to be desired. Since '98, I've had a Tundra and two 4Runners that never had a problem. But I'm willing to give the D3 another chance.

What do I care? I don't own a Lexus, or stock in Toyota. I'm just playing Devil's Advocate, trying to keep you honest. It's hard...

Where is someone imitating Lexus

Toyota/Lexus pioneered hybrids, and now the Germans are coming out with hybrids, lots of them. S-class for starters.

IS-F, beat who

Car & Driver Lightning Lap, tied the M3 and clobbered the AMG C- and E- models.

haven't seen any local Lexus clubs

It's obvious you haven't looked.

I didn't see any examples of actual shortages

I think people talking about driving 15 hours to pick up a Lexus qualifies as a regional shortage at a minimum.

You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.

Any how, back to the topic, BMW had fun at Mercedes' expense for years, teasing them about not offering enough manual transmissions for enthusiasts. FFwd to 4:28 in this video:

You mean Toyota pioneered hybrids, they picked a winner. Lexus didn't pioneer as Lexus doesn't even really operate on an independent level. MB pioneered diesel, I guess every trusty old diesel hilux and landcruiser needs to pay homage to the Germans then?

I see no examples of meetings and shows by local Lexus clubs, and certainly nothing officially sanctioned - as the enthusiast base doesn't exist.

One test by a magazine. OK.

Nobody knows the details of the cars these people wanted or the price they were trying to pay, just some nut who wanted a poserfied IS250. what was the shortage, what model couldn't they get, how much of a discount were they wanting, how did these prices compare to TMV? It's all anecdotal.

MB hasn't offered manuals in NA on most models for more than a generation, and never anywhere in the tuned cars. Hasn't seemed to hurt anything. The vast majority of BMWs sold here are auto as well. But marketing works in its own wold."

No shortages. I can run down and get what I want, maybe not a LF-A or a lime green IS250 with sport trim and an AM radio, or a new RX for 20% under MSRP, but otherwise, no, and it doesn't explain away the gains being made by others."

They are flush with new product right now...the A4 is only a couple of years old, the A6 is new, the A7 is new, the Q7 isn't brand new but it's fresher than competitors, the Q5 is fresh...

All their high volume products are new.

Lexus is the opposite. Only the RX is fresh, and it's doing fine. The ES is ancient, 2007 I think it came out IIRC. The GS and IS are even older - 2006?

The other new-ish Lexus is the GX and it's sales are also up, so it's doing OK.

I'm not sure what people expected from the HS, it's the best selling hybrid or diesel in its price range or higher.

This is a normal part of any car's life cycle. Lexus will have a new GS, a new IS, and probably a new ES within a year or so. The ES in particular is an important volume model for them.

You poke fun at Lexus, and that's OK, but you're inconsistent - in one breath you say Lexus owners don't consider anything else, in the next you say Audi is stealing sales away from Lexus.

But the C5 A6 was seen as a design revelation when it first showed up, and got people to look. It was ahead of its time.

IS and GS are indeed that old...I can't imagine why anyone would buy a new GS. LS is also getting up there. HS is impossible to compare as nothing competes with it - and the way they were laughably being given away in sweetheart leases not long ago speaks volumes. Hopefully for them the CT will make up for it.

Lexus, like all highline makers, has a devoted fanbase - although in this case most are not really enthusiasts. It also has a lot of those who just like to be seen. These are the ones who jump ship. I never said every Lexus owner was devoted...hell, I'd wager a significant amount of money the majority don't know the brand is Toyota...

If something isn't OK to you, you are free to ignore it :P I haven't seen anything from Lexus that would make a person want to defend it, myself. I think the inability of the brand to succeed in other markets is telling. Even their commercials are pretentious or lame."

Life cycles of 6-8 years are perfectly normal in the luxury segment, I don't have to tell you that. You just seeemed to imply that Lexus took longer than most to refresh them - that's not true.

I won't argue that Lexus survives on a ton of RX and ES sales, but with the bank account that Toyota has to throw at the brand, and the strides they are making with the ""F"" line and LFA models I wouldn't count them out for building some serious street cred against the Germans down the road.

Who knows, maybe fuel efficiency will drive the next round of performance vehicles? Hybrid power being tapped to build the next lineup of AMG fighters rather than big V8's and V12's?

Me too.

I watch some tv, skip past most commercials using tivo. Am still seeing the stupid car commercials of cars sliding sideways, every which way. Got to think, who, besides teen-age boys do these commercials appeal to?

OK. If it were Amerian branded cars in these spots, and seeing how top management drove 2 US companies into the ground, then you say they don't know what the h--- they are doing. BUT, respected brands such as Honda and Mercedes continue with this nonsense. Teen-age boys do not buy new cars."

That makes Lexus still (tied for) the youngest lux brand. A heritage commercial for the youngest brand?

Anyone that plays golf, and/or watches it on tv, knows that the game appeals to all ages. The golfers in major tournaments are mostly 20's, 30's.

Most people can relate to common sense everyday experiences as well as aspirational messages. Those in modest homes today and moving up in salaries, compensation can see themselves in a larger home, nice landscaping with a luxury or near lux auto in the setting completing the picture. Cars kicking up dust relates to nothing in either their day-to-day routines or aspirational goals."
1167	May 28, 2011 11:15AM	tallman1	"Cars kicking up dust relates to nothing in either their day-to-day routines or aspirational goals.

Since when does advertising relate to everyday life?

-Pick-up trucks don't pull trailers up ramps of fire.
-People don't really stock their refrigerators with nothing but beer.
-Geckos don't really talk.
-And, sadly, hundreds of women won't chase you if you put on a certain after-shave.

The Benz commercial is taking a product with a reputation for luxury for the wealthy and making it look more adventurous and fun. The added touch of the stuffy lawyers completes the irony.

The point is that we wouldn't be talking about MB if it was golfers and nicely landscaped homes. Advertising is all about making a product stand out... even if we might think it is silly.

So for this commercial, put me down for ""good"" while you and others here will vote for ""bad"" or ""annoying""."

1181	June 6, 2011 6:01AM	loncray	I'm no fan of Chevy or the Camaro, but I saw a Camaro commercial at the movie theater yesterday that made me laugh. It's a dark bedroom with a sleeping guy next to a little dog. The guy stirs and sits upright (still asleep) and moves like he's grabbed a steering wheel and stick shift. He starts making driving noises like a kid would and moving like he's driving spiritedly. What makes the commercial is when the dog sits up on the other side of the bed and sticks his head in front of a fan exactly as if he was in the guy's dream car with him. Cut to a quick shot of a Camaro, then out.
1182	June 6, 2011 7:37AM	ateixeira	Sounds clever. Haven't seen it, and a quick (not thorough) search on YouTube didn't show it.

It's like an evolutionary apology."
1189	June 9, 2011 6:53AM	fintail	Well, the F01 7er is a completely new animal after something like 8 years of the Bangled E65/66 which received only a minor update in its lifespan. The facelifted TL came much sooner after heavy derision - more akin to the Subaru Tribeca with the bullnose Saab or Edsel front end that was quickly redone, and still sells at least a dozen a year.
1190	June 9, 2011 6:59AM	ateixeira	"The facelifted TL came much sooner

Did it? Seemed like it took forever.

All I've heard is people referring to ""pre-beak Acuras"" over and over again.

Let's see, usually a life cycle is 5 years, and a mid-model make-over is done for the 4th year.

2009, 2010, 2011 had the big beak.

2012 gets the light beak.

I dunno, seems like it came on schedule.

I guess for me it seemed like longer because they sell a LOT of Acuras around here.

Ninja Edit: Tribeca was redone for its 3rd year, so indeed that was pushed forward a year from the normal mid cycle refresh."
1191	June 9, 2011 7:06AM	fintail	"You can't say you don't think the TL wasn't redone to tone down the garbagey ""styling"" a bit. Notice the previous nice looking version didn't get much of any updates at all in its lifespan. It was done right. The fact that aftermarket parts exist to mask the beak says a lot.

Tribeca was redone for the same reason, it was just too weird and hard on the eyes."
1192	June 9, 2011 7:11AM	ateixeira	"It certainly was toned down - for sure.

I'm just saying the process wasn't rushed. It was re-done on the normal schedule for a 5-year life cycle, with a refresh for the 4th year, as usual.

In other words, Acura was stubborn. Perhaps they should have rushed the refresh?"
1193	June 9, 2011 7:16AM	fintail	"I think they got a huge ego boost from the success and positive press of the previous model, and believed they could do no wrong - did not want to admit a mistake was made even though sales undoubtedly suffered. A few overpaid execs probably had to be convinced by multiple sources to get the ball rolling.

They didn't have a refresh at all on the previous TL generations either, so I don't know if I would call it normal. I see it as a reaction, not evolution."
1194	June 9, 2011 7:21AM	ateixeira	"Yeah, didn't they just add a Type S model or something?

Seems like they just kept selling more of the same, since the formula worked.

To be honest I didn't pay much attention because back then they didn't even offer AWD."

1199	June 9, 2011 8:33AM	fintail	That's about it yes, the formula worked because the car was competent on the road and a mix of sporty and elegant styling. The new one, not so much of either, although the tech is several degrees higher.

1202	June 11, 2011 10:34AM	stickguy	well, they could pull that off quicker because the front end (and the rear, they changed that too to get rid of the squinty eye taillights) because the design was already done for IIRC a SAAB version? Hope I am not mixing up the models, but I think that is the one that was going to have a cousin that was aborted late!

1204	June 14, 2011 8:04AM	ateixeira	"Good memory.

Subaru was getting divorced from GM, meanwhile the Saabeca had already been developed.

All we saw were some grainy cell phones pics, but the rear especially was absolutely identical, taillights and all.

The more significant change was the move from the EZ30 to the EZ36 boxer engine, but it was too little too late - the vehicle was simply too small for a 3-row crossover. I think GM got the size ""just right"" with the Lambdas."

You guys are right, though, it's big on the outside and small on the inside. I wanted the opposite."
1209	June 16, 2011 8:27AM	robr2	Now I test drove an Acadia recently and didn't find it big at all. Then again I'm comparing it against the Explorer and CX-9.
1210	June 16, 2011 8:35AM	anythngbutgm	Which one did you like the most? I'm digging the looks of the new Explorer but it's kinda tight inside for the profile. The CX-9 is still my fave if I was buying tho, it's just so open and airy inside.
1211	June 16, 2011 8:36AM	ateixeira	"I have a love/hate relationship with Mazda.

I also test drove the CX9. In the driver's seat, your right knee rubs up against some (unnecessary) center console trim. I could not get comfortable. I was bummed because the price was far better than the Lambdas, at least until the $7k incentive arrived.

Funny thing is my MX-5 has an annoying protrusion on my left knee, fixed for 2009, but then they added that silly grin face. Ugh.

I modified the dead pedal a bit to get around it. Easy enough, but Mazda needs to spend more time actually sitting in the cars during the design stage.

Zoom Zoom."
1212	June 16, 2011 8:58AM	robr2	"We're going with the Explorer. Just have to set aside an afternoon to go order it.

What I disliked about the Acadia was that when my wife adjusted the seat so she could reach the pedals, her knees were about an inch away fromm the lower dash - didn't seem safe to me. Also, it's pricey.

I didn't care for the interior of the CX-9. It seemed dated especially compared with the Explorer. I'm not a fan of gated automatics and the switchgear felt low rent to me. Lastly the grin annoys me."
1213	June 16, 2011 9:07AM	ateixeira	You don't want to wait for the EcoBoost model? Just curious.
1214	June 16, 2011 9:18AM	robr2	"No - we want the AWD and the Ecoboost will only be available with FWD.

Here in New England the AWD is worth it - we ski so for that reason alone my wife wants it. We've done fine with just FWD in the past with snow tires but wife wants the AWD. Who am I to argue??"
1215	June 16, 2011 9:20AM	anythngbutgm	Cool, early congrats if you end up with one. The Explorer has been pretty popular, Ford did a great job on it.

Should've spent those ad dollars showing it cruising a Piggly Wiggly, showing off it's trunk space and how many groceries grandma can take home with her. Or how cushy soft the seats were, or the quiet ride (if it had one, I don't know. But it was based on the old GrandPrix from the 90's).

1227	June 18, 2011 3:12PM	explorerx4	"I have had my 2011 for 3 weeks. It's much larger than my'02, which we still have.
I like the 'MyFord' touch feature. A lot of the reviewers don't like it, but they have to figure it out pretty quickly.
Found out today that the turning circle is pretty small, for the vehicle size."
1228	July 21, 2011 5:51AM	lemko	Did anybody see the TV commercial for 21st Century Insurance where the man in the ads recklessly parallel parks a white 1962 Cadillac convertible between two generic moderns cars and knocks their bumpers off? I have no doubt that a '62 Caddy would demolish any modern car and suffer little to no damage itself.
1229	July 21, 2011 7:29AM	fintail	Yep, that's a good one. The bumpers in the Caddy have more metal than the entire modern car.
1230	July 21, 2011 7:48AM	ateixeira	"Heck, and mid 80s Ford Escort passed NHTSA's bumper basher tests with zero damage. Nowadays the average impact damage is $600 or so.

Having said that, bumpers nowadays are not really bumpers, they are an integral part of crumple zones, designed to absorb impacts and increase passenger safety.

Ironically, bumpers are not designed to be bumped. Most are foam filled and are meant to absorb an impact just once."
1231	July 21, 2011 8:12AM	fintail	Aesthetics trumped protection. Those old park bench bumpers with accordion strips could take a bump with no sign anything happened, and on older cars with bumper guards, the same thing. Not always very pretty though. Now, a tap and you're out an insurance claim at the least, but they look better.
1232	July 21, 2011 8:13AM	ateixeira	"Well, we gotta admit, they were often ugly. Especially US-spec bumpers.

Spoiled more than a few pretty designs.

Nowadays you often see no rear bumper at all. It's just incorporated in to the rear body work. No bumper sticks out."
1233	July 21, 2011 8:20AM	fintail	"An emphasis on driving skill rather than the lowest common denominator dreck we get on the roads today might make bumpers less of an issue. But it's too late for that now. And I guess it isn't new either, the bumpers were one of the definitions of the malaise era.

I think modern bumpers are designed to protect light clusters in low speed bumps more than anything else."
1234	July 21, 2011 9:49AM	ateixeira	"Recent licensees can parallel park (though they'll forget in a month), but can they even drive stick?

My 1975 2002 looks like it has a railroad tie mounted at each end. At least I don't have to worry if my 16 year old backs it into a pole or similar...

A couple of years ago someone bumped my wife's X3. It was a very low speed hit. The X3 had a tiny scratch on the rear bumper while the Geo Prizm was a mess. They had to zip-tie the radiator to the front of the upper cross-member and the twisted hood required an extremely hard slam to latch."
1236	July 21, 2011 4:15PM	fintail	Well, they can park between cones in an empty lot. Have them do it between cars on the street. And you can still mess it up and get a license. Our driving rules seem to mirror our racing to the bottom economic and industrial policies.

1267	July 26, 2011 8:25AM	xrunner2	Land Rover had some intelligent commercials during broadcast of Tour de France bicycle races. They showed their vehicle in different settings on paved roads with a couple in the city, country, going to museum, going to restaurant. Not one shot of driving, sliding sideways on dry desert salt bed, no splashing up of mud, dirt flying. They realize that vast majority of people buy their vehicles for everyday and sensible use.
1268	July 26, 2011 8:30AM	xrunner2	Cadillac had an intelligent commercial during broadcast of Tour de France bicycle races. They ran one with a CTS-V on Germany's Nurburgring race circuit and identified it as such. Driving fast on a paved road without stupid sliding sideways on salt bed, no driving very close to a man, or men, standing around in the middle of the road. Cadillac and Land Rover are marketting to people that can afford and actually buy their vehicles, not to teen-age boys.

1284	July 28, 2011 9:35AM	fintail	In a kind of clueless bid to be environmentally friendly, MB changed its type of wiring insulation around 1992. This turned out to be a bad idea, as it decomposes, especially when exposed to heat. Many MB from 1992-94 or 95 eventually need wiring harness replacement. This can be an easy-ish DIY job on larger cars as it is pretty much plug and play, but a pain on smaller models due to less space to work in. 8K seems kind of crazy, but I can see a dealer charging several grand.

1320	August 29, 2011 7:29AM	lemko	Saw a commercial for the Fiat 500 for the first time last night. It was pretty forgettable for such a unique car.
1321	August 29, 2011 7:33AM	ateixeira	They need to take a page from the MINI marketing effort, which has had a small budget but gets everyone talking about 'em.
1322	August 29, 2011 8:25AM	fintail	They need to advertise where their dealers are, too. I have no clue where one is in my entire state.
1323	August 29, 2011 8:30AM	ateixeira	"I think they were offered only regionally and are only starting to expand now.

Fiat just opened a show room in Gaithersburg, MD, and they are advertising it HEAVILY. Can't tell you how many times I've heard about it, and keep in mind I use a DVR so I don't watch commercials on TV!"
1324	August 29, 2011 8:32AM	fintail	That would explain the failure to meet sales targets, and what appears to be a wholesale dump into the Enterprise-National-Alamo fleet.
1325	August 29, 2011 8:37AM	ateixeira	"Link:

http://www.fiatusaofgaithersburg.com/index.htm

They have a 500C in Bianco for $20,100, all it needs is the red/green stripes and ciao, bello!

Actually that has tacky wheel covers, so it would need a set of alloys as well. Maybe put summer tires on those, keep the stock ones for winter.

Prices will settle and they'll be cheaper soon, plus let's see the Abarth.

Kids might actually fit OK in that back seat, too."
1326	August 29, 2011 8:38AM	ateixeira	"If it flops, even better. Low demand means low price.

1327	August 29, 2011 8:43AM	fintail	"I'd hold out for the Abarth.

From what I have seen in the fleets, they are mostly pop or (bianco) sport models, all automatic of course. Normal compact class, so I bet the fleet is getting them for like 15-16K."
1328	August 29, 2011 9:03AM	ateixeira	"Gaithersburg is a huge dealership, but they have 16 500c models and 3 are stick shifts.

Of course all the sticks are base models with few options. Ugh. Why do people associate manuals with cheapness? Try sporty instead! Ugh.

I wonder how it drives, though. I'm a sucker for small cars with character, add an open top, this thing oozes personality. But then I remind myself it's a re-bodied Panda with a 101hp engine and no torque.

Quality/reliability is also a big concern. This is as unproven as they get."
1329	August 29, 2011 10:02AM	fintail	"I think they are faring pretty well in Europe, where they have been on the road for a few years. Good test market, as I think most of the mechanicals are the same, save for diesel of course.

A manual is sporty if it is a good manual. Otherwise, it is just a nuisance."
1330	August 29, 2011 10:22AM	lemko	...you can buy a Fiat 500 at your local Chrysler dealer. The one near me has a few in stock, but the place has no signage suggesting they're also a Fiat dealer.

Their annoying ""Golden Opportunity"" sales ""event"" has the audacity to compare once-in-a-lifetime chances (as shown in their idiotic ""displays"" during the commercial) to a 3-year rentaLease (with a substantial down payment, of course) on RX and ES models (which are a dime a dozen here in Connecticut). If you miss the sale, so what? Car sales are like Taxis in downtown NYC, there's always another one right around the corner.

Although Lexus isn't the only offender, they are quite possibly one of the worst.

An honorable mention goes to Hyundai and their ""Hyundai Censored"" ads on both TV and radio. I call it Hyundai Censored because if it really were ""uncensored,"" wouldn't there be a least some criticism of the vehicles?

Still, Infiniti just isn't racking up sales. I think Nissan is growing a lot, but Infiniti always seems to lag behind. And they have interesting cars - G37 and M for instance.

Of course, with 20"" rims on some of their crossovers, I'm sure Lexus would argue there's no ""sleeping"" in one of those, due to the rough ride.

Did you guys see last month's C&D? A long-term Bimmer 7 with 20s (IIRC) had 3 tires damaged in the 40k miles it spent with them. Those Detroit roads are killer.

Likes:

* fields of corn and wind mills will appeal to the Prius crowd
* Music tugs at your heart strings (plus the vinyl LPs shown)
* All American town, old school feel

Dislikes:

* geezers will not sell cars
* Mitsubishi is Japanese and this commercial feels domestic
* when I saw corn I thought of Ethanol, not electricity

The TV version is much better. Edits out the old lady behind the wheel.

They have an uphill battle, IMHO. I'm not even sure they're targeting the right consumer - it's a city car, not small town USA."
1382	October 12, 2011 12:29PM	fushigi	"I agree about the geezer thing. They could have instead had an ""enthusiast"" talking about instant torque and it being the only RWD EV.

The commercial is for the domestic audience. Honda and other manufacturers orient their US ads around us so I don't why Mitsu shouldn't.

The TV version is better, unlike the Soul ""dancing gamers"" commercials where the long version is much better than the short one.

Normal is where their US plant is so both Mitsu & Normal have a vested interest in seeing each other succeed. And I very much like that it's not California or one of the other traditional ""early adopter"" states that get Leafs & Volts before the rest of the US.

Personally I don't see why a city car won't work in rural settings. Those folks are just as likely to have secondary vehicles for distance runs, though I admit those vehicles will more often than not be less-efficient pickups. On the plus side they're likely not in an area with an overburdened grid.

What plays in Mitsu's favor is the i costs thousands less than the Leaf. Like 6 or 7 grand less while range is only about 10% smaller. If they can find the right audience, it could be successful."
1383	October 12, 2011 1:27PM	ateixeira	"Isn't it the lowest priced EV? Use a slogan like ""the EV you can actually afford"" or something like that. Show young looking folks on a college campus.

Dunno about the rural target - distances between places are a lot greater, so range is a concern to those folks."
1384	October 12, 2011 4:55PM	robr2	"juice - Normal, IL isn't some little town in the middle of nowhere. In reality its a small city in the middle of nowhere.

It has a population of over 50K and is where Illinois State's main campus is located. The school adds another 20K to the population. They have theatres and malls and everything else a good size city has to offer. The city itself is surrounded by farmland but Normal itself is pretty metropolitan."

The worst offender is the one for the Frontier where the jumbo jet with failed front landing gear uses the Frontier's bed as a substitute. I'm sure there's an on-screen disclaimer somewhere that it is all just fantasy, but I missed it. What is the landing speed for a commercial airliner, 150mph? And the weight? The ad is structured in such a way that the unsuspecting viewer might believe it actually happened. Ridiculous.

The other ones are equally bad - one where a Nissan pickup goes up a sand dune that a purpose-built vehicle could not, and a Leaf ad that shows a driver unplugging it from a (non-existent) charging station/parking meter device. Perhaps Nissan is catering to the delusional.

I have disliked Nissan's ads for several years now, with their overemphasis on computer effects, cars spinning into position from beneath the ""floor"" on the screen, etc., but really, these are just too much."

By the time that Equus is out of its lease or financing, the ipad will be a doorstop anyway - if some kid doesn't snag it away from his parents and ruin it first. I think the market just wasn't impressed. $65K car with a $600 ""freebie"", whoop de do."
1405	November 7, 2011 2:56PM	ateixeira	I doubt Hyundai expected many sales. This was a re-tread of an existing car, so they just federalized it and offered it for sale, I'm sure it didn't cost them 2% of what VW spent on that Phaeton factory.
1406	November 7, 2011 3:26PM	fintail	However, Phaeton actually sold (still sells) in other markets other than a small home market, the glass walled plant was more for show than for practicality, not really applies to oranges.

I find the ads for the game (and the game itself) unsettling and troubling, so having a Jeep ad where it is navigating around a city under attack, with buildings blowing up, bystanders taking shrapnel hits while having dinner, etc., is just over-the-top horrid.

TV networks need to beef up their standards and practices depts with ads like these being far too common. There is a dark side to the current generation that is very disturbing."

It was my first Subie after having only Hondas for years and so far I am pleased with it and with my wife's Outback which is only a couple of thousand miles behind and outside of a tranny reflash to fix a minor lurching it has been nothing but maintainence. Heck, both of our cars still have the original batteries!

My only complaint is the service dept. are not up to the standards set by the local Honda and Toyota dealers with the drive- thru bays on those cold rainy mornings or the thorough updates of our cars (Honda dealers used to give us in depth updates on current tire pressures, oil life, transmission fluid life, battery charge, etc...) but as juice mentioned, they do get the job done and so far I am expecting a Honda/Toyota like longevity out of each of them.

I do appreciate the environmentalist messages that used to come across the airwaves and I don't mind the ""Subaru Love"" campaign either. They really do connect with us even if we are mid thirties ""D.I.N.K.'s""."
1428	November 9, 2011 9:22AM	ateixeira	"That ad campaign has resonated well with Subaru buyers. I think the best one is the father/daughter where they show a 5 year old, then a 16 year old. Neat fact - they're actually related. The ad team felt the chemistry was so good they let them ad-lib, too.

The ad with the Acadia Green Metallic Forester (""You never forget your first Subaru"") really hits home because I owned one in that color, and yes we have a current model Forester too.

I think that sort of ad works better than, say, the Ford Fusion Hybrid gas station ads where someone jumps out and yells it has 10mpg city better than the Camry Hybrid which is no longer made.

What horrible timing. First time I saw it, the new Camry was already in dealers.

Do those idiots realize the Fusion gets 41/36 and the new Camry gets 43/39? Hello? McFly!?

They put an emphasis on a criteria where they're now behind."

For me that breaks the thought train we're supposed to have which is the father still envisioning his little girl as his teenage daughter is about to drive off. Otherwise it is a decent commercial. Doesn't shout at you and gives the message about trusting the brand in a way people can relate.

That said, the commercial where the guy misplaces his sunglasses & they wind up in his sweatshirt's hood is one I could easily never watch again. It just makes him look dumb and doesn't advance the brand at all."

Hockey mom:

I like it, but I guess I'd relate more if it were a dad and the sport were football. To be fair, Subaru knows their customers - and indeed hockey is VERY common among Subaru Crew members here.

They seemed to write this ""Reunion"" commercial for ME, about ME:

I had a Forester in that color, took that blonde to prom in high school, but married the brunette. They had me at hello. :shades:"
1433	November 9, 2011 1:39PM	fushigi	"The point is that he's looking in the car at his teenage daughter but in his mind's eye he's still seeing her as the 5 year old. So no, she's not allowed to change shirts.

Different outfits would be OK if the production was done differently, like if it was a memory of different times when she playfully sat behind the wheel pretending to drive or other times in/around the car when she was younger.

Continuity gaps don't often bother me but for some reason this one does. Probably because the commercial itself is otherwise very good."
1434	November 9, 2011 1:49PM	fushigi	"Hockey Mom is OK; people will easily substitute baseball, football, soccer, etc. And it's friendly for airing in Canada as well as the US. The big problem I see is that it does nothing to distinguish the car's features from any other wagon/SUV/minivan on the road.

Reunion I just don't get. Both the man & woman have moved on in their lives are are now with others. In that respect it implies while you might start with a Subaru & keep fond memories of it, when you grow up you'll move on. :confuse:"
1435	November 9, 2011 2:04PM	ateixeira	"The hockey one is my least favorite.

There was a minivan ad that executed the same idea much better. A dad takes over for mom for a day, and drive the kids around in a (I think?) Kia Sedona. By the end of the day he's beat and the mom says, ""THAT is what I do all day"". Much more clever, and they show the seating configurations throughout the commercial. Funnier and more effective.

Reunion - you trade the old one for whatever reason but you still have fond memories, and the person you marry may not be so different (he got another Subaru).

For what it's worth, this ad campaign drove (pardon the pun) Subaru to 2 consecutive records years. It would be 3 if they had enough Foresters to sell. Outback and Legacy both had record months in October, so the brand is red-hot, with only supply issues getting in the way.

My brother had to order his Forester and wait a month or so."

Personally, I liked the 2005-2010 Legacy much better than the current model, but the new one is bigger and has sold extremely well.

There were no significant improvements to the engines. Base models did get a CVT, but that hasn't helped other manufacturers much. I find the increase a big tough to explain, and I'm a Subaru guy, so the marketing has to be working."
1438	November 10, 2011 9:23AM	fintail	"I think the AWD is selling it too. Making it bigger didn't hurt either, even if car people frown upon it - most car drivers aren't car people.

The ads don't impact me one way or the other, although I would like to see the two local Subie groups in it - those who put ski racks on their cars even though they don't ski, just to look sporty, and the boy racer crowd.

You always say Toyotas are bland, beige appliances. They understeer and have uber-numb steering, offering instead quiet isolation.

Subarus have plenty of character. The boxer engines' growl alone would annoy an isolation-loving Toyota fanboy.

Steering feel is generally excellent, since the front tires are not burdened with 100% of the power at any point in time (even AWD Toyotas are FWD first).

Lift the throttle and you'll get the tail to wag, Ain't Gonna Happen in a Toyota. Consumer Reports complained about that, but a Subaru owner wouldn't mind.

Until recently Subarus didn't even have window frames, to give you an idea how much NVH control was a priority.

Toyota styling is an oxymoron. More like a lack of it. They're designed to blend in.

Name one Subaru that blends in. Tribeca was WAY out there, too much so. The new Legacy is more Infiniti-ish with the stacked headlights, the Outback is bold, the Impreza is blocky with shoulders. The Forester is about as conservative as they get.

So similar, except how they sound, feel, drive, steer, and look.

The only thing they have in common is 4 wheels."

But really, Subaru is a lot less nichey than it used to be. In the Northeast and Northwest, it is every bit as normal and regularly seen as other brands. I've never known a time when a Subaru was really odd - I remember them being common sights here back in the 80s.

You're funny, how do you explain Subaru's success? You hate the designs, hate the marketing, and hate the engines. Perhaps the public does not agree with your opinion?

1456	November 12, 2011 8:48AM	ateixeira	"When does it stop being a niche and start being mainstream?

Let's go back to your Venza argument - competitors realized people were abandoning body-on-frame trucks in droves and Subaru was in the right in the hot spot - crossovers. They offered the high vantage point, cargo room, and traction of the trucks, with few of the trade-offs.

Venza has not succeeded, though. It was planned before Toyota owned part of FHI, but it failed to steal away any Outback sales, in fact Outback sales grew significantly.

So that crushes the theory that the buyers are the same - clearly they're not. Subaru buyers are loyal, and have not been buying Venzas and Crosstours. So much so that both of those competitors are bombing in an ugly way.

Also, Nissan Rogue hasn't hurt Forester sales, they also hit record levels last year. RAV4 and CR-V existed before the Forester, but Subaru sales have grown steaily since 1995, before either of those were born, also.

That might upset the die-hards

As much as we asked for the WRX prior to 2002, we didn't really like the influx of, well, let's say less mature owners. You may feel the same way if a bunch of newbie C250 owners join your club who don't even know what a fintail is.

The die-hards bought WRXs too, though. That's how they more than doubled sales. New customers = growing pains. And you can't say WRX stole Civic and Corolla sales, those buyers are also very different. Go to a NASIOC meeting and all you're hear about Honda is a lack of torque. Toyota does not come up in conversation at all.

A lot of people defend the Porsche Cayenne, too. Small manufacturers can't survive in small niches only. Subaru had to branch out, but that doesn't make them Toyota.

Speaking of upsetting the die-hards, and lot of them are upset that the BRZ will not even offer AWD. This is still controversial. I feel mixed - love the light RWD affordable funster idea, hate that it will draw in the demographic that watches Formula D."
1457	November 12, 2011 9:29AM	robr2	"Venza has not succeeded, though.

Juice - I'll disagree here. The Venza sells 50K+ units a year. For a niche vehicle, it does just fine IMHO.

It hasn't stolen sales from the Outback but I feel that isn't it's target. It's target is to keep exisiting Toyota buyers from defecting to Subaru. IMHO, the reason Toyota invested in Subaru was to get cheap, quick access to manufacturing capacity in the US."
1458	November 12, 2011 12:23PM	fintail	"The current Tribeca is just the old one sans weirdness. Doesn't matter though, both are very rare sights, probably never really needed in the lineup.

Do good sales come from sound design or simply appealing to the masses? The masses don't care much about visual details unless it is *too* weird. Too bland is just fine - Corollas and Camrys don't sell because of timeless good looks, and neither do Subies.

I already explained Subaru's success - running for the mainstream. A few new segments. Making vehicles both blander looking and larger. Some product differentiation with AWD. Not a beauty issue.

""Hate"" is an awfully strong word, almost kind of a red herring :shades:"
1459	November 12, 2011 12:31PM	fintail	"Or maybe the Venza (and especially the ugly Crosstour) is just a surplus product not needed when countless buyers are happy with their RAV4s and Highlanders. How many variants of basically the same segment can you make?

Subaru is gaining buyers, so it must be gaining them from somewhere - mainstream brands. And mainstream buyers who will now go to Subie because Subie is now in fact mainstream - in size and looks especially.

Where did WRX buyers come from then? Most of them probably weren't new to owning a car. Boy racers who came to the WRX in droves came from somewhere. Newbie C250 buyers will generally be leasers and/or people who don't become involved with any club - not loud people, not really apples to oranges. They might be trading from a similar base 328i or IS250 or something.

And I agree about the (will it ever be seen? can we hype a platform more?) BRZ, no AWD, hard to see the point of existing under the brand."

Funny side note ...

Saw the guy who lives next door at a dinner party a mutual friend was hosting, he drives an 11 year old Volvo Cross Country and his wife a w211 E350.

Well, we're talking about a renter who lives across the street, his car was vandalized twice. I comment that it's surprising to see a Benz broken in to not once but twice, given they are generally secure, and he says ""Yeah but that's not a real Benz"".

I bust out laughing.

It was amusing to see such a lack of acceptance for the Baby Benz. Perhaps Mercedes needs to bring the B-class here if only to remove the stigma of that model being entry level.

I guess there are relative levels of mainstream, but IMO Subaru really isn't an off in left field quirky choice anymore. It's another car. BRZ better look a lot different than it's Toyota twin or the Subaru nuts might not fall for it."

New C coupe isn't a hatch, it's a trunkback. Saw a C63 coupe at the dealer a couple weeks ago, I am not a fan as it isn't a hardtop, but it seems like a good amount of German muscle for the money, not as douchetastic as an M3, kind of a sleeper. Not my first choice, but if I got one for free...

C63 is $60 grand, ouch. Wait 5 years, let some Yuppie absorb 2/3rds of the depreciation, and get one for $20k.

I can't see why an IS250 or G25 etc would have any better rep

They don't. The Lexus has it even worse because that direct-injected engine has carbon build-up issues that the IS350 does not have. First thing people will recommend is to step up to the 350.

The only thing the G25 did was allow Infiniti to bump the price on the G37.

Oddly enough, both are 6 cylinder engines, even though a lot of people (even enthusiasts) don't realize that."

Despite supply issues I see Fitz has 10 Legacy/Outback and 5 Foresters.

In fact all WRXs are manuals.

with 2.5 kids
Yes, but let's be specific - the 0.5 kid is a dog.

backbreaking mortgage
Actually, incorrect. Subaru owners do not live beyond their means. Actually, the opposite is true, we could afford a fancier car, but choose not to.

insane wife

1477	November 15, 2011 8:31AM	ateixeira	"Newbies are coming from a variety of brands, Saab for sure, but also Ford, Volvo, and yes the mainstream brands, too.

I don't think Subaru went mainstream. Mainstream came to them. AWD is in fashion. Subaru was already there, before it was trendy.

To me, though, mainstream means FWD transverse I-4 engined sedans. Subaru is about as far from that as you can get. That doesn't mean some former mainstream owners won't switch over, but that's not the core, loyal Subaru buyer.

Subaru's best selling models are the Forester and the Outback. Go back 40 years, and that's what they've been known for - wagons with 4 wheel traction and as you would say the characteristically ""coarse"" engine. That's still true today. The DNA is intact (hence the BRZ controversy).

Compare to the other boxer engine makes VW and Porsche. The Beetle uses a mainstream layout now, transverse in-line 4 that is front mounted now. Totally mainstreamed.

Porsche's 2 best selling models are a fat SUV and an ugly sedan. Where is the engine in the back? The air cooled boxer? They are so far from their DNA it's sad.

Porsche sold out and uses VW platforms and engines. They sold their soul completely. Sure they still make cool cars, but those are not the best selling models (like Subaru).

Subaru has remained indy and stuck to the simple formula of AWD wagons til this day. If they HAD sold out, you'd see Toyota's in-line engines in their models, or worse, Toyota's AWD systems, but you don't. To cooperate they had to build a whole new platform, and heck, Subaru engineered it and will build it at their plant!

As mentioned above the only thing the partnership has meant so far is that Hoosiers are now building Camrys at SIA, and it's not even on the same line Subaru uses.

Going forward I'm hoping Toyota can offer then Entune and not much else. I think they'd be wise to remain completely separated as they are now.

I still think they should have figured out a way to make the BRZ AWD, though."
1478	November 15, 2011 10:48AM	stever	"I think Subaru got some of the older Volvo crowd, the teachers and ""practical"" folks that liked boxy and drove them forever (ignoring the rally aspect of the Subaru crowd).

Volvo moved on to sporty so Subaru picked up some of that bunch. Like my sister who loved her old Volvo wagon with the sharp corners. She's in a Forester now. But it looks like Subaru is following the Volvo trend now with more ""stylish"" rides.

I'm shopping for a tweed jacket with leather elbow patches for running around in my old Outback this winter. And a pipe."
1479	November 15, 2011 10:56AM	fushigi	"Nah. Mainstream is defined by sales volume, not technology. Subaru is on track to sell over 250K cars in the US this year. That's slightly more than Mazda & MB and less than 20% behind BMW. Well behind, though, VW, Kia, and the big guys.

The niche brands are generally going to be under 100K units a year. Mitsu, Suzuki, Volvo, Jaguar, etc. occupy that space. Mitsu's got the most volume in that group and will probably just crack 80K units for 2011.

In fact, based on YTD sales through October there's no brand with sales that fall between Mitsu (70K though October) and Mazda (209K through October)."

Subies aren't a real niche anymore. The bloated and fairly bland styling, frameless doors went away, engines (while still rough) are quieter, there's been a 6cyl option for some time now and I'll wager the take rate has grown, toning down of controversial designs...looks like a run for the middle to me.

Like in the recent ""daddy-daughter"" commercial, what is that thing she's sitting in, an Accord? :shades:

Beetle is apples to oranges - old layout was always oddball and simply wouldn't be possible in such a car today. Same for Porsche - they need profits in this new age where the next quarter is as far as anyone looks, and their suits understand the wealth gap has grown in this globalized mess, along with the ideal of irresponsible conspicuous consumption by the beneficiaries - who love the Cayenne. Money talks and BS walks, same for a sportscar company or for a once-niche brand like Subaru.

BRZ not being AWD is a sellout chapter for a brand that is less of a niche than ever before, and becomes more distant from the ""niche"" label and more embracing the mainstream with each new model."
1482	November 15, 2011 11:25AM	ateixeira	"No argument there, but again, did Subaru go mainstream, or did the mainstream shift towards Subaru?

They're still building boxer powered AWD wagons, just like 40 years ago.

Mitsu is at a turning point, gotta see if the iMiev catches on. It's tough to get volume in the EV segment, but the $7500 incentive represents the biggest discount in terms of %. If states help, and more work places offer free EV charging stations (my garage has them now), it could prove popular, but can they build very many?

My question is, what's their identity?

It's just that it's hard to imagine the EVO and iMiev in a show room right next to each other, without even a hybrid to bridge the gap. Can't really sell a green image convincingly.

I guess they could go for a ""tech"" image, but they would need a Sync/Entune type system, and maybe make it standard.

Aren't they partners with Peugeot and Citroen now?

What about a C6 to fill the Galant's slot?

They need fresh product. The partnership with Chrysler sucked the life out of them."

1489	November 15, 2011 2:24PM	fushigi	"AWD is mainstream, and you can probably thank the rise of the CUV for that. As you know, it's available on bread-n-butter vehicles like the Sienna and Fusion so it's somewhat difficult to see it as a continued differentiator.

To be honest, few people care if Subaru's engine is a boxer or an I4 just like few care if BMW uses an I6 vs. a V6. They just want an engine that starts reliably and preferably has enough power to get them to CostCo and back.

Subaru became mainstream. Perhaps it was due to some of Subaru's differentiating tech becoming mainstream, but I'd argue it's where Subaru wanted to go. Their commercials show it; they don't play up features specific to Subaru, they don't make as much fuss as they used to over AWD, they don't even go after an appearance of ruggedness.

As to Mitsu's identity, I think you're on the right track with them going for a tech image. An EV contributes to that and Mitsu has a long history of offering more than the average number of gismos. Evo & i coexisting? The Corvette & Cruze Eco coexist on Chevy lots & the F-350 Super Duty & the Fusion Hybrid on Ford lots so what's the big deal?

And hybrids are coming. How about a midsize plug-in hybrid CUV? 30 mile EV range then normal hybrid mode? Effective 141 MPG? Even if it only gets half that in the production unit it'd still be by far the most economical to drive CUV.

The i will be the least expensive mass-market EV in the US. Something like $6 or 7 grand cheaper than the Leaf. Unique looks, which will definitely be a love-it-or-hate-it thing but it will grab attention. It's RWD which is also unique in the US EV world.

Mitsu has FUSE ( http://www.mitsubishifuse.com ) for their hands-free system. It's a little basic right now but can always be expanded.

Peugeot & Citroen have rebadged the Outlander. From what I read they're also going to sell the i and there may be other model sharing, but the talks back in 2009 about the companies buying into each other fell through in early 2010.

They do need a ""new Galant"". They will remain niche unless they can offer a midsize sedan that's segment-competitive (which the old Galant was not). I've been saying they should rebadge the Kizashi but maybe they have something else up their sleeve like a hybrid-only platform."
1490	November 15, 2011 2:32PM	fintail	And virtually all of them have that great tech. Peanuts to buy, not to maintain, and it'll only fool the unwashed if someone is trying to look rich for cheap. Might sound nice and have beautiful leather, but doesn't float my boat.

Agreed.

few care if BMW uses an I6

Let's see how they react to turbos with fewer cylinders, though. Or worse - FWD. That's a paradigm shift.

midsize plug-in hybrid CUV

If the old Escape hybrid can do it ... I like that design, just ditch the clear lights everywhere, it looks like a black & white photo.

My wife had a Mirage, and I did look at a Galant VR-4 AWD, too. Then they went FWD/V6, directly targeting the giants, without the resources those companies had.

Well JLo is Puerto Rican not Mexican - I doubt you'd find many Mexicans in the Bronx. In fact Puerto Ricans really don't want to associate with Mexicans.

http://www.autoextremist.com/

signing JLo for reasons unbeknownst to anyone still operating with at least a modicum of cogent thought

The first JLo spot was a warmed-over cut of a long-form video she did, which was mystifying in its intent, other than it had her driving a Fiat 500 and dancing around it at the end. High concept it was not.

The second attempt had JLo driving around in her old neighborhood stomping grounds in a Fiat 500, pretending to get in touch with her inner Real Girl, which was about as believable as JLo flying coach to get in touch with her fans. As if.

And finally, the lowest of lows was JLo prancing around on stage at the American Music Awards this past Sunday evening with a Fiat 500 as part of the backdrop in the most blatant bit of product placement in television history. It was offensive and incomprehensible, and it predictably drew a loud chorus of post-show outrage from stars and the media alike.

The fact his parents took the car from him shows they are still in control despite the man's 30+ age.

Lexus SUVs actually seem pretty rare around these parts. I'll usually see the aging, sagging, former trophy wives trolling around in SC430's, while used LS400 and 430 sedans seem to be the latest fad for the poseur crowd to park out in front of their section 8 housing.

I don't see very many of the newer LS460's around. Most common Lexus seems to be the ES350, which seems harmless enough that I can't make any derogatory generalizations about. Mainly purchased by well-off, middle-aged to older people who want a nice, upscale, comfy car that doesn't draw too much attention to itself.

There's a woman at work who drives a black GS hybrid. She's pretty high up the income ladder though, so it's not like she's stretching to afford it. At one time, she had some low-production BMW roadster, like a Z-8 or something like that? I heard it got lost in a divorce, though.

I kinda like the older ES300 models. I thought they were really attractive, with their rakish lines, low roof, and frameless door windows that gave it a faux hardtop look. I thought they messed it up with the ES330 though, which just looked fat, and had those peeled-back headlights."

At least the RX can carry a decent amount of cargo, unlike an X6 or an FX37. To me those seem more pointless.

The RX (and XC60, and GLK, and Q5, etc) are basically trendy crossover wagons. People buy them for the space and high vantage point, though those likely have legitimate appeal to the female target buyer.

The X6 doesn't make sense to me, though, if you want sporty, why buy 3 tons of vehicle? And forget utility. I've never liked the smallish FX and EX models, either, to be fair."

In reality, the wagons and minivans were all about utility. BOF SUV's came about just as the first boomers were reaching their mid 40's. Boomers are the first generation that cared more about themselves than others so the gravitated to anything that drew attention to themselves.

The manufacturers picked up on this and started marketing more and more SUV's up until it wasn't fashionable to drive one. So the new focus is now onto CUV's.

Overall, the car market today is more about marketing wants than about capability/needs. 90% of the auto market could get by with a Camry/Accord/Sonata with a 4 cylinder and automatic.

Well if Subarus are ""trendy"" then I feel bad for them. That means their sales will go drop once people move onto the next trend. If you want to say they've become more popular that's fine. But IMHO, they aren't trendy.

My take earlier was to say that the vast majority of us don't buy a vehicle for simple reasons. Most - including myself - drive a car for what we want it to say about us. With cars, it's been that way since the 30's when GM started to come out with new models every year and create a marketing driven auto industry. If they hadn't we'd still be driving around in some variation of the Model T.

Although you like to look down upon Lexus buyers, your E55 and fintail were chosen to poject to the world what you want it to think about you - even if you don't know it yourself. My Odyssey was chosen because it projects stability and quality. My VW Passat shows that I the quality of German engineering but enjoy the value of the VW vis a vis an Audi.

I look at the condition of a car saying at least as much about the driver as the car itself, maybe more. A filthy new highline car says many things, as does a pristine 20 year old normal model.

No digs being made, certainly not one of our beloved 1%. Many people do buy a car as an appliance that says nothing.

That's actually not a coincidence. Several Ford stylists jumped ship to Mopar a few years before Iacocca went over, so as a result, a lot of Ford and Mopar products have a lot of similar styling features. Both tended to have bold, crisp, angular designs, whereas the GM cars of the era tended to be a bit more rounded off.

GM would start making their cars a bit crisper with styles such as the re-skinned 1980 full-sized cars and the 1981 personal luxury coupes (Monte Carlo et al), but they were still a bit more rounded than the Fords and Mopars."

You're right, but I gotta confess, I'm just as guilty. Here's what my '79 5th Ave is sporting...



I have a set of alloy wheels that were used on the Cordoba/Mirada that I'm planning on putting on, one of these days. Maybe in the spring. This car's due for new tires soon, so I'm thinking about waiting until then. The front tires don't have many miles on them, but are about 10 years old. The back tires, which are on 15x7 copcar wheels, date back to February 1999, and came off my '89 Gran Fury. They're pretty worn down, too, so driving in slick weather can be a bit of an adventure! :surprise:

Oh, I just looked online, and it looks like that road wheel that the other NYer is sporting was available as an option. Here's a page from the 1979 New Yorker brochure. It reminds me a little bit of the rally wheels that are on my '85 Silverado, although not nearly as beefy. My truck has 15x8 wheels, but I think these New Yorker wheels were only 15x6. FWIW, the wheels I have on the car now are 15x7 all around, although the copcar wheels on back are offset more, so they give the car a more stable, less tipsy posture. I'm pretty sure the Mirada wheels are 15x7 as well."

Kia's average transaction price was only $19k or so, so they need to work on moving people up the price scale. Now that they've shed the cheap car image, the timing is right.

Another bias of mine is high tech/efficiency balance over brute force. I'm not talking hybrid, I'm talking GDI, turbo, diesels, etc. over an 8 liter V10.

Actually Dodge is building a V10 that's even bigger than that because apparently 8 liters was not enough. :sick:"

I think soft suspension is very much a growing demand in NA as roads crumble. I can see the need for the higher ground clearance - Lexus and MB don't make AWD for sport, they make it for snowy climates.

I like tech too, esp direct injection, which is one reason you don't see me mocking Hyundai tech - they are forcing the mainstream to keep modernizing.

So you have no brand preferences at all? A Brilliance, Hyundai, Toyota, Subie, MB, Audi, Bentley are all equal if the price is the same?"

Brands? All things being equal I'd still pick Subaru among the mainstream and probably Audi for luxury (all things being equal means equal reliability).

Both brands pitch AWD for performance, not just for bad weather.

Edit: a major criteria for me - both offer many manual transmission options, too.

Hyper luxury? Bentley uses AWD, right?

Hyper performance? Probably Nissan GT-R, for the giant killing launch control and the mere bang-for-the-buck."

Even then the first one was used. Also, the 2nd Subaru was for the wifey, and the first Ford was used. So I have actually never bought the same brand twice (new).

I guess no to loyalty, then.

1782	December 12, 2011 1:43PM	ab348	I know everyone has different priorities for their vehicle but the one thing I would like manufacturers to invent has nothing to do with agility control or softer ride for crumbling roads or anything like that. Instead, I'd like them to protect windshields from flying stones somehow. On my last few cars I feel like I have a bullseye painted on the windshield as they always get peppered by stones and either crack it outright or leave divots and scars. I don't remember this being such an issue in the past. In 2 months my new Regal has already taken 3 direct hits and has 2 divots. Fortunately no cracks yet. I dunno why there seem to be so many more stones on the highways these days, but it is a real problem.

And about the windshield issues, I agree. Is glass weaker now than in the past, too? Seems every time I take a highway trip, especially in the rain, I get a tiny chip. No dings or cracks, but the chips are adding up."
1785	December 12, 2011 2:24PM	ateixeira	"I picked a 98 Forester over Honda and Toyota options because the Subaru's engine actually had torque. :P

The Jeep Cherokee was antique and trucky, plus my dad's fell apart, so no way. The Zook/Chevy Tracker was narrow and weak, and had zero appeal. Wasn't much else in the class at the time. Ford had not launched the Escape yet, and when they did they had funny recalls with steering wheels falling off and wheel studs breaking off. I prefer for the wheels to stay on the vehicle, thanks.

Edmunds Live event (in 2000) actually had to park their Escapes, so I wasn't even able to sample it.

Forester won on merit, and was my first new Japanese car, actually.

Got a used NA Miata, no explanation necessary. You can't exactly daily drive an old Alfa or MG.

My first top got old and cracked, so I replaced it. Then the 2nd top was vandalized. I was done with soft tops, but I still wanted a roadster.

I actually looked at the Solistice but the top system was just LOL bad, you had to get out of the car to take the top down and it ate up the entire trunk. Worst top design in history!

Tried a G6 convertible but structure was creaky and weak. Also tried PT Cruiser (don't ask). Rented a Sebring and it also had one single good feature, a big back seat. Did not drive a Solara due to reading posts from biased people like you that convinced me it would be way too soft.

So my one bias that prevented a test drive was against Toyota. Ironic, eh?

VW Eos dropped off my list when I read the VW threads and found it was the least-respected German car among fans of German cars.

The Volvo C70 cost too much new, and I wasn't buying a Volvo out of warranty after friends dropped 4 figures at a time to fix little broken things like sensors. Never mind big things.

So I got a new Miata. 2nd choice was ""keeping the old Miata"". There was no #2. I would not have turned down an SLK320 manual, but they're rare and I wanted a new car.

Then came time for a minivan. Dodge was still selling the old GC at the time, the rear windows didn't even open. Simply not a contender.

I drove the Kia but that was still the old Kia. Overweight, old engine tech, horrible gas mileage, pre-Schreyer design. If I was poor a $19k base model was acceptable. Good thing I'm not poor.

FWIW I loved Kia's concept for a replacement. Let's see their next van.

So it was Honda vs. Toyota. The whole family went, Toyota won 3 to 1, one of the kids preferred the Honda, everyone else voted Sienna.

In each case it was purely based on merit, 3 different brands. The Sienna is made in the USA, but that wasn't really a factor, to be honest.

And to come full circle and get us back on topic, I bought mine before the popular Swagger Wagon commercial went viral, now at 10 million hits and counting:

I'm not a big fan of the new Sienna (cost cutting) and can't bare to look at the new Ody. Dodge still needs work on the interior but they're getting there. Quest is a bit off for me, especially the SUV-like interior. People buy minivans for the minivan interior, why give that one primary advantage up?

So if my van were totalled today, I do not really have a 1st choice. Hopefully Kia will step up."

""Listen to the music. It's annoying isn't it? Well, Team One put thought into that as well, I guarantee you.

I haven't read all the details but Oz-spec Subarus often have skid plates, full size spares, low ranges, etc. We've been asking for the stuff they get on the Forester for ages, to no avail.

XV will compete with the Juke and Outlander Sport. The former sells well, so there is a market for these little runabouts.

On paper I would have guessed the Outlander Sport would outsell the Juke, so what do I know? The marketers must think the young active set just want a hatchback with a lot of ground clearance to get to the mountain bike trail or rock climbing place.

I don't like the name, XV looks like roman numeral 15. They say the letters, and what's a Crosstrek? Half Crosstour, have Jetta Trek?

They'll probably sell tons."
1861	December 29, 2011 1:41PM	fushigi	"There are two main problems holding the Outlander Sport from being more successful:

1. More marketing support.
2. The powertrain. It is too buzzy and has too much of a ""CVT feel"" where you hear the engine rev but don't feel a corresponding kick in the butt fr0m acceleration.

Drop Mitsu's 2.4 in it, add GDI, or move to a conventional 6-speed AT and I think the powertrain complaints would alrgely go away. The 2L is a fine engine, it just doesn't mate well with the CVT, at least not in the Sport.

Around here I see way more Outlander Sports on the road than I do Jukes (or Cubes and other funky Nissans FTM). But it seems like Chicagoloand likes Mitsu more than some other areas as I could say the same about seeing any number of Mitsu models that have never been strong sellers (Endeavor, for instance).

I agree XV isn't a good name. exvee, ziv, 15 .. none are pleasant."

YMMV, but don't let a few posers ruin the whole batch. Next time you hike on a trail that has rock climbing, pay close attention to the parking lot, you'll find a lot of Subies.

Every time we take the boy scouts out that's what we've found. I don't even think it's the AWD - it's the fact that they've always made wagons that fit all the gear, plus they have roof racks and those cargo boxes that go on the roof. Subaru re-brands everything Yakima makes, basically."

1933	January 25, 2012 7:36AM	lemko	Heck, maybe Al Bundy's Dodge wasn't bad publicity. It was still running after 18 years, at least according to one episode. Actually, Al's Dodge wasn't a Dodge but a Plymouth Gold Duster.

He first ended up with an AMC Hornet he had to push into his garage. Then ended up with a Gremlin and said, ""This one's so light, I can practically pull it!"""

Kia is the official automotive partner of the NBA. Lots of teams and leagues have marketing tie ins with auto companies. For instance the Red Sox have Volvo as their official vehicle. Heck Chrysler is the official car of the NFL but only in the UK.

TV shows have always had product placement deals with auto companies. I always remember reading the credits at the end of many shows looking for the ""Vehicles Courtesy of ..."". IIRC, the Brady Bunch used Chryslers, Family Affair used Pontiacs and Archie Bunker used generic beer."

Mainstream TV is not the main venue for promoting the performance of these cars.
X Games, Internet, video games, that's where the invincibility is promoted.
The cars are very capable, just not invincible. No different than the Raptor in that respect.

First, lemko, I remember seeing my first '70 GSX that looked EXACTLY like the one you pictured, in the showroom of Tom Kirkpatrick Buick in Meadville, PA. My sister bought a used '65 Dodge Coronet there and I was hanging around when she was doing the paperwork. Meadville was about 25 or so miles away from where we lived. I remember as plain as day that the sticker on that GSX was $5,500-odd.

Secondly, commercials...

I hate the stupid Sonic bungie (sp?) jumping one.

I also hate about every Ford commercial I've seen the last two years. Is talking down to Gen Y'ers the way to advertise? Maybe.

I love the Chevy commercial where the son bought his Dad's old '65 Impala to give back to him. Wish I'd have seen it air more often.

I'm typically not a Chrysler guy, but I sort-of like their ""Imported from Detroit"" campaign."

For my pop it was a '72 Buick Electra. I should take him out to a Buick meet to try to find one like his.

He just picked up a 300 convertible. For a long time he was a Ford guy, not sure why he left GM."

I'd take that over any test-tube woodgrain, ever (although in the Caprice it was used in addition to fake woodgrain).

I know I'm an older guy, but I also like brushed metal if done right. Love it inside '71 Cadillac deVilles, but apparently the public didn't, as mid-year they started using fake woodgrain inside, instead."

I don't mind matte wood finishes, if the wood is real, but if it is plood vs real metal, I will take the metal.

Speaking of commercials, I saw a kind of neat Subaru Impreza sedan one yesterday, where it shows the life of the car via the odometer in reverse, with the man meeting his future wife in a fender bender and ending with a new car in a driveway."

2156	February 25, 2012 12:41PM	uplanderguy	"Do older customers have warm, fuzzy feelings about their Subarus or their parents' Subarus? I have to ask, because honestly, that about makes me laugh out loud. Really.

I remember the early '70's Subarus our Pontiac dealer took on (then later dropped). Frameless door glass on thin doors, tiny-tiny wheels and tires, and plastic inside that felt like it'd snap off in your hands. And they rusted out, just like the guilty American subcompacts of the period."

Yesterday I was leaving a big parking lot that I thought I knew. It was heavily overcast, snowing and misting out and I didn't wipe off the raindrops off the driver's side glass. Instead of going the half block to the end of the aisle, I cut through by the light pole where I thought there was a road cut.

Nope, was a snow berm about 4' wide. Only about a foot or so deep. I got halfway through and realized that something wasn't quite right. :shades: The Subie (with its new shoes) just scrunched right through. That gave me a lot warmer and fuzzier feeling than having to dig a high centered sedan out. Bad enough clearing the snow out of the lower part of the grill and foglights when I got home."

So, that is a good scenario for a Subaru commercial to appeal to ""adults"" and possible customers in the snow belt. Practical, makes sense, rather than an Infiniti driver having kids throw snowballs at a BMW driver.

Subaru had a light-hearted cute commercial for young folks with a recently married couple going on a camping trip and then getting caught in rain in their tent."

I was lucky to grow up in a time when college was still relatively affordable and one was still able to find work after graduation - even if it wasn't the best fit or have much to do with your major.

I regret that the domestics took on the imports' way of offering product...minimal colors, body styles, and colors. As little as 25 years ago--maybe less--one never saw an exact duplicate of a car. Options were individual. I liked it that way. Now I see the identical car...I mean identical...parked next to its twin on a new car lot. How boring.

There's also less intentional obsolescence today, which is a good thing. A 1952 car in 1962 looked positively ancient. A 2002 car in 2012 often looks modern and the average non-enthusiast probably has no idea it isn't newer.

The color ideal is a valid point, powertrains and bodystyles too. Look at how many variants you could derive from an Impala or Galaxie in the mid 60s. You can still get lots of different color options - but only in highline cars. I will also say this when looking at my cars - the modern car has near supercar performance, is quiet at speed, smooth, reliable, needs no special maintenance, gets better mileage than the old car, and has a lot of cosseting features.

The larger coupes were Monte Carlo/Regal/Cutlass/GP. The latter were updated for 1988 (and sold relatively well, I think) and the old Monte soon dropped.

Taurus had all the thunder in the 86-onward time for sure, huge mass market appeal."

Watching what happened to Oldsmobile is a study of GM at its worst. They had confusing focus all around and lost all concept of what an Olds should be. Then, as a parting screw up, they did that bit where they decided Olds was going to be their import fighter will all the new designs (which to my eye were actually quite attractive and still hold up today) with the same mechanicals underneath. The import folks weren't biting and there was nothing left for the traditional Oldsmobile buyer to relate to. It was sad to see that happen.

That said, I agree with uplander that one mid-level brand is enough. Certainly no one else had more than one after the grand Edsel experiment. Chrysler had their own middle brands but by the late 50s DeSoto was functionally dead and completely so shortly thereafter and Dodge was just a rebadged Plymouth."

Also, very inefficient with space. The back seat was tiny.

Those were Grand Am clones, right? IIRC.

Remember the odd ball Cutless Supreme convertible? Those were pretty rare. They had that style bar like the VW Cabrio had.

That said, I was hearing good things about the 3rd Generation F-Bodies so I was leaving the door for American Iron cracked open a bit. Then I saw two TV commercials almost back to back.
The first was for a 1979 Z28. It attempted to capitalize on the IROC series and it featured a stock Z weaving in and out of a bunch of IROC Camaros parked on a starting grid at a race track. The thing was, the Camaro was being driven at walking speed- my mother drove faster than that. Yawn.
The next ad was for an E21 3er. Filmed at the Nürburgring, it was a bumper level shot from a lead car that focused on the 320iS chasing it. Both cars were moving- just hammering through the corners- including the Karussell. That was all it took(well, it didn't help that the 1982 Z28 was a joke).

2292	March 19, 2012 7:23PM	xrunner2	Saw a dumb commercial for BMW 5 series. A guy is driving his BMW on flat straight road out in the middle of nowhere. Suddenly, an airplane, flying extremely low, appears behind the car, catches up to it, and a fueling rod extends from the airplane. The driver, who has his sun roof open, holds up his coffee cup and the fueling rod puts coffee into it, splashing a little bit. What kind of dope does this commercial appeal to? Creativity(?) by grammar school boys.

Way back, in the Datsun era, one particular model, 510 I think, was considered the poor man's BMW. It was a highly desirable car by enthusiasts and used for years by amateur racers.

And it was Datsun, not Nissan, when the 240Z affordable Japanese sports car originated. So, the current Z car, and any true sports type car from Nissan should be named Datsun in recognition of the heritage. Let ordinary suvs, cars, etc have the Nissan nameplate."

2300	March 21, 2012 11:02AM	robr2	"I was shocked that Nissan would drop the equity they had in the name at the time. Never got why.

Well the brand was always Nissan for cars and Datsun for trucks in Japan. From what I gather, when Nissan decided to sell in America in 1960, it was felt that the target market wouldn't buy a Nissan as it had a huge role in war manufacturing for Japan. But Nissan was always to corporate name here in the US.

In the 70's they started labeling their vehicles ""Datsun by Nissan"". It was 1982 when they actually started to market the Nissan name and it was 1984 before they dropped Datsun altogether. The reason for changing the name was to have a world known brand name. ROW had changed to Nissan years earlier and Nissan was a bit jealous that Honda and Toyota had known corporate names and they didn't."
2301	March 21, 2012 12:11PM	ab348	Yes, the 510 was touted as the poor man's BMW 2002 back int he late '60s. It had a 90+hp OHC engine, decent steering and handling, and was certainly a bargain. Of course, you also had to deal with thin plasticky upholstery and cheap trim bits, and a biodegradable body that would rust with a vengeance in anything other than a desert environment. You almost never see any around today for that reason. My brother owned a 510 wagon for a time and it was pretty good at first, but it did not last.

About 1 year ago, saw a Mercedes sedan upside down just after a toll booth on an exit at Illinois I90.

Saw an excellent commercial last night for the 2013 Ford Mustang. Done on downtown streets of some big city somewhere. Very artful, creative. Did not have to do the ""standard"" sliding sideways, sliding close to standing car, sliding on gravel or sand, driving fast very close to standing man, etc., and was very powerful and appealing.

Young, ""hip"", dare I use old term, people shown, especially the opening scene with a young woman in black dress. All people, including young child, looking at the Mustang driving at ONLY speed limit, cruising(?), and changing colors, Mustang models, finishing with accelerating Mustang with V8 growl. That commercial evokes images, emotion. Got to have it. I, xrunner, former owner of a Mustang GT, would like to have the 2013.

It took talent, creative ability to do that Mustang commercial. That is in contrast to ""little"" creative effort to do sliding ""standard fare"" of sideways on gravel, sand, drifting, driving fast thru vacant big buildings, etc., nonsense."

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV2-StGUcMw&feature=plcp

First, some kind of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang themed car that looks like a model. Then, the underwater car is definitely a Volvo 122/Amazon. Then the tunnel car shows what looks like a Miura with a rear extension - but the people are in a BMW E9 coupe. Then we see the new Azera (haven't seen a real life one yet), some overstyling but a quantum leap from the literally invisible previous model. When will Hyundai do a heritage themed ad? :shades:"
2389	May 14, 2012 9:03AM	lemko	"I think the commercial would've been better if they used clips from the real ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" movie, the television show ""My Mother the Car."" ""Christine,"" and ""Knight Rider."""
2390	May 14, 2012 9:24AM	robr2	"Licensing all those clips was probably cost prohibitive so imitating is the next best thing.

BTW - I've seen the Azera in the flesh and it's much more restrained than the Sonata. IMHO, even thought the Sonata is only 2 years old, the styling hasn't aged well."
2391	May 14, 2012 10:42AM	fintail	"Funny to me that the ad makes telematics as some kind of future dream. Hyundai has some innovation but this is nothing new.

I wholeheartedly agree about the Sonata. It is going to look very dated and overdone as time moves on."

I guess if the AMG ML dates back to 2000 or so, and the X5M isn't new either, Lexus needs to make a pretend-sporty trophy wife sled too."
2395	May 23, 2012 1:40PM	ateixeira	"Total oxymoron.

Sport model of their luxury soft roader.

Probably should not exist, but then again, I bet it sells well even though it's not truly sport.

Actually, probably not as bad as a really stiff X6 with gigantic wheels. Break a wheel over the first speed bump."
2396	May 23, 2012 7:09PM	fintail	"I think some top Lexus brass are really on a sport kick, and want it applied elsewhere. They finally learned the isotank ideal doesn't sell to all markets or all consumers. It will sell, and now the huge sunglasses set can pretend to be sporty while driving with a latte in one hand, iphone in the other.

I think an X6 is at least made with the pretense of sport - X5 will be softer. Remember, the X6 [non-permissible content removed]-container is a ""SAV"", while a new X5 will cart affluent suburbanites from the Whole Foods to the botox center to the over-leveraged mcmansion...hey wait, that's what the X6 does too :shades:

I just saw the BMW ad that touts its email reading abilities - nice to see it was in front of an ordinary looking house, maybe BMW is trying to appeal to a broader market, or not incite bad feelings."
2397	May 24, 2012 7:43AM	ateixeira	"I never liked the X6, from the get-go. Can't believe it sells so well.

If you want a sporty 5 door, start with something light. And the X6 isn't even roomy inside. Imagine how well it would perform if they put those same engines in something like a 3-er wagon.

BMW will soon have tie-ups with Infiniti, sharing engines. I'm afraid soon all the character will be extracted out of these vehicles, whatever's left anyway.

Reads e-mails, yeah, that's how it will stand out. LOL"
2398	May 24, 2012 8:07AM	fintail	"X6 is just ugly. Although at times when I want to drive like a jerk, I can see how it would come in handy - people would expect it from you. Same for driving a Range Rover or G Wagen - you can drive arrogantly and it won't surprise anyone. X6 in particular is all about (the pretense of) style over substance. A way to flaunt that you have more money than sense.

I like to be in a car to get away from emails."

So maybe a Cross Cabrio pulling a trailer, but that's about it. And who would want to drive that?

Perhaps the Forester is the exception, as many crossovers go in the X6's direction. The original CR-V and Escape were also boxy, with great cargo space and visibility. Less so now."
2482	June 20, 2012 8:14AM	fintail	"Most crossovers have, as a segment, become less practical and more obese than the wagons they replaced. Your Forester is an anomaly which is aped by virtually no competitors, and it is not the most modern design either.

Style over substance pretty much defines the class.

Speaking of dumb commercials, the Acura ILX ""office"" commercial is lame, mostly because the car is lame."
2483	June 20, 2012 8:22AM	ateixeira	"That's a more recent trend.

The Forester was a lot roomier than the Impreza wagon.

The CR-V was a lot bigger than the Civic Wag-o-van it essentially replaced.

The Focus wagon may have been bigger than the Escape, though, not sure.

The RAV4 is a lot bigger than the Corolla wagon (Fielder overseas).

Only the wagons based on bigger cars offered more room (Accord and Camry wagon for instance).

Even then, you could argue the Pilot and Highlander replaced those, and they're far bigger as well.

The trend is toward style, a la Evoque, but not all crossovers are impractical."
2484	June 20, 2012 8:32AM	fintail	"Did those really replace the wagons you mention though, or just wagons in general? In this market, those you list either have many year gaps between the wagon and higher riding estrogen infused mommymobile, or even concurrent sales.

They offer greater profit margins, which is why the marketing side embraced them, giving them the masquerade of style to people who think a Corolla is nifty. Not all crossovers are impractical, but most require sacrifices that are not worth the gain unless you just have to sit a little higher and pretend to be rugged and capable."
2485	June 20, 2012 8:40AM	ateixeira	"Most of those were introduced right around the time the wagons were phased out. The Civic Wag-o-van even had the Real-Time 4WD logo on it.

Subaru dropped the Loyale wagon. The Impreza ""wagon"" was really a 5 door hatch, the Forester was essentially the wagon. It grew taller over the years.

I know you dislike the class overall, but the fact is many are quite practical, roomy, have great visibility, and offer a high vantage point which probably appeals to the often female demographic that buys them.

Just because they don't serve you doesn't mean they don't serve a purpose to someone else. It's much easier to fit a child seat in a CR-V than in a low Civic or Accord. The AWD is for honest all-season use, not off road use.

To me that's better than pitching XTerras to soccer moms with extreme rock climbing commercials. They were buying the wrong type of vehicle for them. Crossovers are better suited to their needs than 4x4s ever were.

Would you really rather see soccer moms driving Jeeps and XTerras? Not me."

Honest all season use in sunnier climes - it's not about the ability, it's the image. Child seats are kind of a stretch too - how many of them are actually fitted with these? People like to pretend to be rough and adventurous. Line that up with the potential for high profit margins, and a new fad is born.

Is that the vehicle's fault?

Conversely, wouldn't you rather have that person in a car with good visibility, AWD, and slower acceleration than a wagon would have? Sure the prices are higher but they all got stability control well before wagons did (the class pioneered that feature).

The CUV is very easy to drive, much easier to park. It's also my foul weather choice.

For me they serve different needs. I guess you could compare a Forester to a Mazda5 if they brought the AWD model here, but they don't, or the Focus C Max.

Forester is shorter than a Chevy Cobalt but offers 114 cubic feet of interior space, so it's small outside, medium-sized inside.

Stick - The Expedition was bought in late '98, so the kids were 10 and 12 at the time. Before that, she had an Escort sedan (that the aforementioned Tempo was traded in on). The kids are now 25 and 23 - and the 23 year old is still at home, so there will often be three of us in the CX-7.

Does AWD make everyone overconfident? Another generalization. At least provide some evidence to support the theory. Sure you've observed a few 4x4s in ditches, but isn't that likely because they're the only ones out there in those conditions?

If crossovers are so dangerous, why is the Highlander one of the cheapest cars to insure? Cheaper than any subcompact that costs half.

I'd argue that a ""Sport"" mode button in the center console would have far more of an effect at creating overconfidence than an out-of-sight, out-of-mind feature like AWD.

People press the button and think they're an Andretti all of the sudden. Have 700hp on tap probably hurts, too.

It's a very cool place. The engine building room isn't entirely ""by hand"" like the marketers want people to believe - it is modular, but all of the component assembly is by hand.

Nowadays I think the powertrains are made there and shipped to Bremen or something to be put in cars - back in the day gutted cars were sent to Affalterbach for final assembly, my W210 was made that way. AMG has made a number of promo videos over the years, here is a period one for the W210: http://youtu.be/c3TzxYzB6J4"

Had one of our vehicles in to the dealer for an oil change during last winter. Dealer does ""free"" inspection of things such as brake pad thickness, tire tread depth, etc. Marks the data on a form attached to the receipt.

Had snow tires (on dedicated wheels) on the car during oil change. I am the one who puts on, takes off snow tires, puts on summer tires. Have used torque wrenches for many years to tighten lugs to spec. So, in early March, found that lug nuts on snow-tired wheels on one side of car way, way over-torqued. Had to use an 18 inch bar with socket AND an extension water pipe to break.

Went to dealer. Have known the Service Manager for many years. Talked to him. First asked how they check brake pads. He said they look at wheels on one side. Ah hah. Told him what I found. He apologized and said they ONLY use torque wrenches, do by hand. Showed me torque wrenches at various mechanic work stations.

Of course, too-tight lugs will cause warped rotors, pulsating, perhaps customer going back to dealer and THEN service people saying some kind of brake job is needed."

2578	June 27, 2012 8:31AM	fintail	I suspect quality is pretty much uniform, and there is not a huge amount of room for error in the modular assembly. Germany is a first world country (unlike much of this one) with apprenticeship programs and vocational training - many of the workers there were actually fairly young, starting off in a specialized facility from the beginning, trained right out of school, with a job progression supported by their employers even though the costs are high. Funny how that can work under the right leadership. No doubt the bar is higher to get in there, but maybe they don't want those set in ways learned in a normal factory - as it isn't one.

That melody is burned into the memory of all who watch it over the years. There is no other car commercial series and standard melody that is so well known.

A while ago I said the Countryman should just have been the BMW X1.

But if an X1 increases sales enough, it could still make a greater profit than X3. Probably cheaper to build.

It's not even that tall. We were almost at eye level in my mom's Honda Fit."

We bought my wife's 2004 CPO X3 in December of 2005. We paid less than the cost of a new Escape or Liberty and the X3 had a longer warranty.

IMHO the GS and CT look best with the spindle. The LS is OK to me. The new ES is the least attractive application of the spindle grille.

It's selling, though. ES was up 43% last month. RX was up 47%. That's with zero powertrain upgrades, and neither is truly all new.

The GS was up 452.3%. Woke up from the dead basically.

The scorecards:

CT 1,499 +4.6%
ILX 1,410; hybrid 110

Looks like the take rate on Acura hybrids is quite low. The CT crushes the A3 TDI if we compare luxury brand fuel sippers.

IS 2,296 +7.9%
TSX 1,980 -7.3%; wagon 316 +37.5%
Regal 1,784 -49.4%
A3 651 +49.3%
1series 379 -42.9%

Small segment, but that's where you hope to snag young buyers.

3series 7,653 -11.4%
G 6,078 +88.8%; coupe 1,287 +1.3%
Cclass 5,663 +24.4% (includes coupe)
CTS 4,743 +6.6%
LaCrosse 4,001 -33%
ES 3,759 +42.9%
A4 3,449 +51.7%
TL 2,358 -7.7%
MKX 1,724 -10%

I didn't realize the ES had faded back that far. Price overlaps a bit with the IS, so Lexus sort of takes a 2 car approach to this segment. New C is putting a dent on 3 series sales though.

5series 5,700 +32%
Eclass 5,089 -.5%
XTS 1,739
A6 1,691 +66.8%
GS 1,662 +452.3%
MKS 878 -19.7%
M 652 -6.5%
RL 40 -38.1%

XTS had a strong launch. GS is at least on the radar now. Acura should just throw in the towel.

7series 1,696 +158.9%
Sclass 852 -3.9%
LS 536 -7.2%
A8 401 -10.9%
Equus 362

The 7 is totally dominating. Equus is doing a lot better than the VW Phaeton did at this point of its life (closest competitor being a flagship sedan from a non-luxury brand).

RX 7,357 +45.7%
RDX 2,664 +162.4%
X3 2,311 +4.7%
Q5 2,090 10%
GLK 1,880 +15.5%
EX 215 -61.6%

Your favorite vehicle POWNS in your favorite class of vehicles.

XC60 is not listed but I could not find a press release from Volvo to add it manually. It's very low volume, though, well behind the Q5.

RDX shoppers seem to love the big V6. Surprise, it outsold the new X3.

SRX 4,911 +18.8%
Enclave 4,360 -29%
MDX 4,288 +35.1%
X5 2,283 -31.4%
JX 1,999
Mclass 1,790 -35.6%
Q7 891 +12.8%
GX 813 +6.1%
FX 498 -23%

Surprise, a Caddy on top. Infiniti is finally on the map with the JX.

X6 259 -55.4%
ZDX 85 -9.7%

Kill them both with fire."

I haven't even seen a new ES yet. Maybe those are old ones being blown out in sweetheart leases?

I am not surprised about the 7er - it is newer and cheaper than the S, and less risky and seemingly better value than a comparably equipped A8. Looks like the S is still walking on the LS too, and the now 3 year old E is handily beating the GS."

2710	August 10, 2012 6:53AM	ateixeira	"Absolutely, and you have no kids...

I liked the W211 sedan, but the W212 sedan doesn't look as nice as the coupe.

The Benz that would interest me most is either the SLK (as my daily) or the B class (as a downsized family vanlet), the latter a Bluetec. SLK's top looks complex so I wouldn't touch one that wasn't CPO, though.

Guy across the street is an old school Benz fanatic and it shopping for an SLK, though not actively. He's an older guy, 70s, just had knee replacement surgery, much younger wife.

Don't know why, though. They use a car service most of the time, and their W123 E class stays parked while the wife drives (of all things) a Ford Escort station wagon. I never got that. They used to have a pair of W123s.

He used to own a couple of old Fintails, IIRC. When I was a kid, I knew the previous owner of the house I live in now, I was friends with their son (still am). He did a photography project where I was the subject, playing soccer in his front yard. The funny thing is his 2 Benzes are in the back ground.

I'll have to dig that up and scan it and post online, maybe for the guess-what-car thread."

I sat in a SLK55 once and I just didn't fit right - head too close to the top of the windshield, and I couldn't find a seating position to remedy that. I also sat in the back of an E90 yesterday, and my head virtually touched the ceiling...I need something with headroom. I could practically wear a fedora while driving in the fintail, without touching anything.

Mazda3 is about as fun as you can get in its class, keep in mind we're talking about Cruze, Civic, Corolla here. Mazda3 is downright exciting even with a slushbox.

The SkyActiv model is the most fun you can have in the 40mpg club, per Autoweek, an enthusiast leaning magazine with expensive tastes. They cruised at over 70mph and still managed over 40mpg, too, so real world mileage and fun.

2801	September 5, 2012 11:22AM	robr2	With Brady doing these Dodge commercials, I wonder if he will not longer drive the A8 that is loaned to him by Audi through Best Buddies - a non-profit he is associated with.
2802	September 5, 2012 11:26AM	ateixeira	"They stopped making those.

The new 6 wagon looks interesting, and even comes in diesel.

Wonder how they'll market that. Mazda is odd in that its small cars sell best."
2803	September 5, 2012 12:28PM	fintail	"Just stopped, to finally be replaced by a less bland model. I don't know if many private buyers bought them at all after 09.

2804	September 5, 2012 1:02PM	ateixeira	"The outgoing one was a huge flop. It was enormous, but the back seat had no headroom, and you'd bang your head getting in if you didn't duck.

2807	September 6, 2012 7:33AM	fintail	Saw/heard the Camry ad twice last night. Really, does someone think that ad will make a random viewer want the car?
2808	September 6, 2012 10:39AM	ateixeira	"Not sure who that ads targets, maybe Nascar Dads? Saw it and yeah it's lame.

The one for the FR-S is really good, though, a heritage ad. Let me see if I can find it..."

I liked the Mark II turbo MR2."
2815	September 6, 2012 12:19PM	fintail	Celicas since 1990-ish - boring. Last MR2 turbo was made in what, 1993? The later one was boring too. Supra was cool but was a low volume high price choice.
2816	September 6, 2012 12:40PM	ateixeira	The GT-S or whatever it was called revved to something like 17,000 rpm. Not my cup of tea (surely not yours), but certainly not boring.
2817	September 6, 2012 1:11PM	fintail	17000rpm? Uh....it's not a hyper sportbike or a Chrysler turbine car :shades: . Are you talking about the early 2000s one that was an engine with a goofy power band and a bunch of bolt on knicknacks? Yeah, not for me.
2818	September 7, 2012 8:50AM	ateixeira	"Sorry, my mom told me a million times not to exaggerate. :shades:

If anything, that Celica's hot tempered engine was not boring enough for people who walk in to a Toyota dealership.

Some models (Corolla IIRC) got the torquier 2.4l engine to replace it."
2819	September 7, 2012 9:46AM	fintail	"Or not boring enough for the typical Celica buyer in ca. 2002, who was usually either a middle aged woman or a young woman. Thing became a Camry coupe with an anime-inspired body.

I don't know if torque = boring, my E55 begs to differ :shades: If I want to rev the living hell out of something to get it to move, I'll ride a small displacement bike. Most cars with that personality haven't fared well on the market."
2820	September 7, 2012 10:53AM	lemko	"The name ""Celica"" even sounds feminine, so I'm not surprised it was popular among women. ""Supra"" sounds masculine. I believe the Mitsubishi Eclipse was the popular choice of doting Dads for their princess daughters."
2821	September 7, 2012 11:19AM	ateixeira	"Didn't mean to imply that torque was boring, only that 2.4l was an engine more suited to people who don't want to rev the daylights out of it, i.e. a boring driving style.

Camry coupe? Nah, Camrys are big, the Solara served that niche. Celica was much smaller and probably lighter."
2822	September 7, 2012 12:15PM	fintail	"I like an engine that can rev, but doesn't have to in order to keep up with traffic. Like a tuned larger displacement engine.

OK, Corolla coupe then."

2825	September 7, 2012 1:40PM	ateixeira	"Not the original, I meant the one in the ad, 99 and newer.

By then the Camry had gone ""big"".

Wiki says T230 platform, looks like it was unique, not Camry or Corolla-based."
2826	September 7, 2012 1:51PM	fintail	"It just filled the Corolla coupe role. Especially with a slushbox, which I'd wager a fair amount of them were saddled with.

Wheelbarrows of money? Only suckers buy new :shades:

2827	September 7, 2012 6:29PM	xrunner2	Commercials. Dumb BMW with low flying military tanker? Dope driver in C Class sliding around on gravel in a make-believe Hollywood setup town.? Mercedes or BMW vehicles sliding around or busting up beaches? Yes. We need more of these intelligent commercials.

2832	September 10, 2012 8:18AM	fintail	"Who buys cars to help a manufacturer?

The luxury residual issue is caused by leasing policies - at 24-39 months, the market becomes flooded. CPO can do only so much.

You don't have to be a millionaire to afford a 3 year old MB, even if the average punter on the street can't tell it from a new one. I am surprised Lexus doesn't have similar ads featuring the stepford wives who like their AWD/SUV vehicles.

Saw the Acura ""elegance in its most aggressive form"" slogan last night, still kills me as the TL is neither elegant nor aggressive."

The previous TL was a fairly elegant design - even though it was pretty much a fancy Accord when in base trim."
2840	September 10, 2012 10:31AM	fintail	"Could be a 39 month lease bought at the end of 2010 - so she's still in it for a bit. Lots of the Lexus IS lease demographic here fits that stereotype.

2842	September 10, 2012 10:37AM	fintail	I never said it wasn't nice. But to me, nice and elegant aren't the same thing. A leather lined Camry would be nice enough for a long road trip too.
2843	September 10, 2012 11:59AM	ateixeira	Elegant ... that's a slippery slope. I think of car that try too hard, like the Range Rover Evoque.
2844	September 10, 2012 12:24PM	fintail	"Tell that to the Acura ad writers, not me. Would you call the current TL ""elegant"", even when de-beaked? It's a nice car, but not some kind of design standard.

No Range Rover is really elegant to me. The big boy is dignified in its own way, but all are kind of brash and ostentatious. Cars for should-be-hanged FIRE industry crooks, lobbyists, showy lawyers (and the glorified concubine other halves of those), and then they trickle down to pretenders when they get old and depreciate like week old bread."
2845	September 10, 2012 1:11PM	ateixeira	TL peaked a generation or two ago when it comes to styling. That's true for a lot of cars in that segment, though.
2846	September 10, 2012 1:36PM	fintail	"The 04-08 one was certainly the high water mark.

What else is in that segment, really? Is it all FWD? While TL isn't ""aggressive"", it is sportier than anything in the same desired target market and price range."
2847	September 10, 2012 1:57PM	ateixeira	It's like Acura - the middle man, neither here nor there. Upscale, but not really luxury. Sporty, but not quite a sports sedan.
2848	September 11, 2012 7:15AM	xrunner2	"The 04-08 one was certainly the high water mark.

Wife and I each have one of these. Handling is good for a front driver AND driving responsibly on public roads. On the latest TL, drove a 2012 FWD loaner and it is definitely not as lithe, responsive. Seems cumbersome with relation to 04-08. Steering and on-center was a problem for me just as many car magazine testers have reported. Styling still a problem. If Acura does not correct in next gen (2014?), will look elsewhere."
2849	September 11, 2012 7:24AM	xrunner2	Saw a commercial recently for Audi in big city street scene. There is an armored truck somehow weaved into the story line. Man waiting in Audi car is joined by a woman bringing coffee. Audi joins BMW and Mercedes in making commercials for teen age boys. These companies need to get some decent ad agencies. Maybe those that do the 2013 Mustang street scene, some of the Range Rover spots.
2850	September 11, 2012 10:27AM	fintail	"I have no idea, but I wouldn't doubt that the newer model is a bit heavier.

Not very ""aggressive"" or ""elegant"" either, I really have to wonder what they were thinking with that commercial - especially as it then advertises a lease deal for a base car."
2851	September 11, 2012 4:13PM	explorerx4	My favorite commercial right now is the kind of creepy one for Heineken with Amy Winehouse. It does have a gated stick shift in it.
2852	September 11, 2012 5:11PM	ab348	"That is not the late Ms. Winehouse. It is Clairy Browne and the Bangin&#146; Rackettes. The entire commercial is actually better than the shortened version that is far more frequently shown. See the full version here:

So maybe they were trying to steal a part of the 2013 Mustang commercial in a street scene that changes colors. But, the Mustangs did not have to drive through a wall.

Apparently, Mercedes is making commercials for kids and teen age boys. They enjoy commercials with cars sliding sideways in sand or gravel, ripping up beaches, sliding sideways on a beach front by the ocean, latest driving through a wall."
2868	September 17, 2012 9:17PM	fintail	There was a previous G-Wagen spot where they were crash testing it into a wall, and it broke through the wall, unscathed. I bet that would really irk you, unrealistic!
2869	September 19, 2012 10:25AM	ateixeira	Reminds me of recent Dodge advertising, going after men's men, almost neanderthal-ish.

2871	September 19, 2012 11:23AM	xrunner2	Saw a commercial for Lexus ES in city street scene. When camera is shooting from behind the car, it seems there is a small dent in trunk just above right tail light. Slo-mo'd it. Possibly shadowing, or a dent?

I guess that depends on how they position the new IS.

Here's the Paris concept that previews it:

http://www.autoblog.com/2012/09/17/lexus-previews-lf-cc-concept-ahead-of-paris-d- - - ebut/

Looks CGI-ish so let's see what it looks like in the flesh.

I'd like to see them overlap the IS and ES in price, and just target a different buyer. They may not do that and instead make F Sport models to target them.

That Morgan show was probably the most interesting episode so far. The end result ended up costing more than their restored Elise, though, and I'd prefer the Lotus.

2888	September 20, 2012 11:31AM	ateixeira	"ES costs a bit more. Truecar says base is about $4-5 grand higher, street price, and that was the outgoing model.

If I were planning I'd make the ES soft, the IS sporty, and let the CT serve entry level buyers.

They'll probably do a whole mish-mash of ES S Sports, soft ISs, etc.

That CGI sedan in the Hyundai video seemed more inspired by the Maserati Quattroporte, if anything."
2889	September 20, 2012 12:05PM	fintail	"Not much to add to a payment or lease. But, they sell to different demographics, that's the difference. ES does not sell to under 40 year old men, unlike as shown in the commercial.

Your plan is the most logical, and maybe move the soft IS buyers into the ES. Other ways dilute model credibility.

So the Kia K9 is a BMW, and the new Genesis will be a Maserati."

Not seeing much conservative - conservative in that design mindset is just copying an older car instead of a newer one (see the first Equus). It is possible to have an overdone copy too, like with the poor mans CLS. No need to defend it, not a real underdog anymore than a fresh MBA grad with a Romney sized trust fund behind him is really starting out on his own.

I don't doubt that it's a bit staged, but in the end, he sells a real car for real money.

Interestingly, last night he ended up selling the Moggie to a dealer and not a private party - partly because he was trying to sell it in the middle of winter in the UK.

But, as noted, I like that they ""rescue"" these cars and give them a new lease on life.

Well, they shot the second episode right here in town. They have us bring some of my musical instruments over and say we'll negotiate it for $1,600 and handed me 16 $100 bills. We poked around and several people got interested in these instruments and had to get steered away.

As the commercial progressed, the wires came off and the mustard yellow skin came off to reveal another color. Cannot believe that these types of commercials are running for what is considered a world class car manufacturer. Would the excellent CEO Alan Mullally of Ford allow this type of commercial? He or one of his staff did foul up once by making a commercial of a Taurus stupidly sliding around. But, just one. Not a cavalcade of sillyness.

2902	September 22, 2012 6:37AM	ab348	I saw that same commercial. Obviously done by the same agency that did the one with the chains that ripped off the back doors of a sedan to make it into a coupe. Just awful concepts. This is the downside of commonplace and cheap CGI technology - agencies can do all kinds of stuff in commercials now that should never be done. It is like every Nissan ad ever made over the last few years, all of which are dumb CGI-fests. The Mercedes ads are really terrible these days and they need to fire their agency or their marketing execs who approve this stuff.
2903	September 22, 2012 7:44AM	benjaminh	"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3dr8XFQr4k

Imho this is a good commercial. It's corny, yes, but it works. It practically reduced my wife to tears and made her hug me and the dog.

I think you can see why it's good by comparing and contrasting it with an ad for the new Nissan Altima that I've seen a lot. The Altima ad is good enough. It shows the car in a blank white room being digitally exploded and re-imagined and rebuilt as a better car. Fine. But what does that say about how we actually live with and use a car in daily life? Not much.

The Honda Accord ad shows how cars are part of the fabric of our daily lives. Life is good but at the same time sometimes complicated and messy. The wet dog may shake off on the back seat. You might use the car for a nap at some point when you're really tired. You want the car to protect you and your loved ones, etc. But it's much more about real life than most car ads. Life isn't perfect, but in the middle of that you can rely on your Accord like a rock. I think it's one of the best car ads I've seen in a while. Is there a chance it's a little too corny and emotional, esp. for men? Yeah, maybe. But I think it breaks through the clutter and actually makes you pay attention. The length&#151;at 1.5 minutes&#151;is also daring. But interestingly Honda has also made 30 second and even 15 second ads with the same cast of characters that also work well.

Clearly Honda's ad company worked to bring their A game to this ad....At least imho. Your results will vary."
2904	September 22, 2012 8:30AM	fintail	"Not a bad ad, really, although clearly aimed at the fairer set.

People in that world sure keep their cars clean, and will that key fob die if exposed to a wet dog? Where are the LLCers and blind turners though? Also nice to see the Accord has sprouted LEDs, and the more I look at this new one, I get a slight nuance of BMW."

1974 was the year that BMW actually got a foothold in the US, and got noticed by the Big Three, thanks mainly to the oil embargo. That year, they sold about 40,000, compared to maybe 160,000 Cadillacs. But, nobody considered them to be a luxury car

'10 Mazda CX-7

Note the progression from pure boxes to something a bit more stylish. However, we didn't lose any functionality when we went from the VUE to the CX-7, since the Mazda is slightly bigger in all dimensions.

Higher roofs allow for a taller, more upright interior, which in turn is very practical.

The Forester isn't significantly longer or wider than an Impreza Sport but it has tons more cargo room.

(OTOH if you compare an Impreza XV to an Impreza Sport, the 3"" of lift does nothing because the shape is still the same.)

Similarly, RAV4 is much bigger than a Corolla Fielder station wagon.

The 2002 wasn't a glitzy chrome-laden boat with a marshmallow ride, true- but its only real weakness was the lack of a decent fresh air ventilation/air conditioning system(the heater will pump out hot air down to @-15F). Aside from that I can't see how any American iron was superior in any way save raw horsepower. The '02 had comfortable reclining seats, a carpeted trunk, and a SOHC engine- and no domestic possessed a better balance of ride and handling. Even today I would just as soon drive my '02 as anything else in my garage- as long as the temperature is below 80F. The only '70s vintage US car I'd seriously consider owning is a 1970-1974 Z28 RS.

The Forester can (has) fit large appliances, including oversized clothes washers. That's $50 off the delivery charge each time, plus no waiting.

My Golf bag carrier fits inside without having to dismantle it each time.

Bikes will fit in there, though I prefer to use a rack since the mountain bikes get messy (that's the whole point). :shades:

Picked up the family at the airport and the van carried 8 people, so the Forester hauled most of the luggage. We couldn't get 3 suitcases in our previous midsize sedan (which was longer).

What do you get at big box stores? Big boxes. Check.

Add all those instances up and it's fairly often that we use that capacity.

The best part is the overall length is shorter than a Chevy Cobalt coupe. So no big size penalty.

Pick the right crossover (some are *not* practical) and they are right-sized. Small outside, capacious inside.

New Forester pics are leaking and the new one is still under 181"" inches long and will have another 10% cargo capacity. They know what their customers want!"

I don't mind big cars so long as I don't have to drive it in the city. Long wheelbase is actually good for long highway drives, smooths out the ride. In the city, though, the smaller the better, for me at least.

You sacrifice 26% of the cargo space to go from an E wagon to the CLS wagon.

And how practical are crossovers? The much smaller GLK actually matches the 54.7 cubic foot capacity exactly. Coincidence.

The shape is different, a box basically, rather than a long floor with a low ceiling, but you can always stack boxes.

I'm not even a fan of the GLK, but you see how practical a small crossover can be. It is more than 16 inches (!) shorter overall than the CLS wagon yet matches the capacity, which supports my ""crossovers are practical"" theory quite well. :shades:"

My NC has 17""s, overkill for these roads. The sport suspension package added Bilsteins and summer tires, so in an odd way you end up with too much grip. Limits are higher but it's less fun, and they don't break away progressively like the old one.

Not sure but I may swap or sell these and go to 16""s, which still fit over the brakes.

I know the Chevy gets (got?) most of the credit back then, and the B-O-P and Cadillacs were very neat that year too, but I think the '77 Caprice was just perfect packaging. In fact, out my window today I saw (again) a very clean, gold (ick but factory-correct) '77 Caprice Classic sedan blow down our street, sitting perfectly at all four corners, no visible rust, no visible smoke, and looking about like a two-year old car. To me, that styling has stood the test of time way better than anything else '77.

To this day, I'd love a '77 Caprice coupe, scooped-out spoke wheel covers, F41 suspension with pinstripe whitewall Goodyear tires, 350 engine and Custom interior (Buick-level). Trouble is, there doesn't seem to be any really nice ones out there."

It was a 77 and it was loaded with all options. Wife and I bought it used and had it for many years until we moved up to a Suburban that served us very well. These vehicles served very well for the utility aspect we needed. However, there were issues with both of these vehicles that we lived with. We had Chevrolets side by side along with our Hondas and Acuras for about 19 years. The superiority of engineering, reliability and quality of the Honda/Acura brand over GM/Chevrolet was very evident to us."

How could a German car maker make a commercial without all of these stupid backdrops? A commercial that actually mimics how vast majority of Americans ACTUALLY use cars.

I would like for BMW to arrange for me to get a coffee refill on a nearby long straight rural road with a military tanker plane flying low with a boom filling up my coffee cup through the stupid sun roof opening I never use that is mandatory on all models of the car brand that I buy.

Shouldn't we stand up for what's happening to German cars now, then?

You shop CPO so for you the effect is delayed, but ..

* steering feel is going
* throttle responsiveness is lost
* they park themselves now, too
* they virtually drive themselves (lanes, cruise, braking)
* they've retreated upscale (price, weight, content)
* wheels are bling
* auto start and shake violently stop

Yet I hear no protest from you, the enthusiast. I bet we'll hear in in 2015, when the 2012s go to the CPO market.

MB: moderate steering feel, not sporty - historical standard. Always had a heavy throttle too. No self parking that I have seen. All cars are heavier and loaded. Generally boring wheels. No auto start/stop. So nothing for me to complain about other than weight and bulk (and price). In 2015, I'll probably have my current car, unless I find a huge deal."

On MB, it is throttle weight as much as travel. Going from the fintail to a W126 many years ago was a different world. The old car has a light pedal, as it has a revvy engine, and needs to rev to get moving. The tank though - like there was a brick under the pedal. E55 is kind of like that too. But - in a car like the E55 where passing 2K rpm makes you go too fast, it is kind of a mellow driving aid. I prefer it to a too light pedal. I remember my grandma had an Olds with a pedal that would shoot you forward with a cm of travel - then in typical 80s GM 6cyl fashion would run out of breath around 50mph.

MB had the poorly thought out (and now seem to be gone) commercials that pretty much said ""I was dumb and my car saved me""...but isn't as loud about it as others. And I don't want to hear about empty FWD suits so long as the ES Supercamry exists Maybe with potential future FWD cars, MB is chasing the boring retiree market that is soon to be a much larger part of sales."

That's for you, fushigi. :shades:

Now we see where Range Rover drew inspiration for its new head and tail lights (kidding of course, but Mitsu was first).

In the video you catch a quick glimpse of torque vectoring.

Overall a departure from the current model, but at least that remains."
3048	October 2, 2012 12:38PM	fushigi	"Thanks. I've been too busy to really keep up with the auto show circuit and other developments.

The video is a bit light on details but a cruising range of 880 kms (550 miles) would be nice. I hope for the NA market they move the plug to the driver front area; that would be more convenient for the average person who pulls into a garage.

Granted it's all CG but if the shape is accurate it looks like Mitsu went over the design with an eye towards aero efficiency; surfaces seem a bit smoother than the current models. And the grill area is reminiscent of the pre-2010 design.

It looks like the electrics will drive the front & rear wheels while the ICE will drive just the fronts. That should keep AWD complexity down on the hardware side (without really making the software that much more complex).

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMEuG2dhE_o&feature=relmfu has a few more details including some hints at the revised interior. Looks like they've kept the 3rd row but revised it. Also made the second row fold flat v. flip forward so cargo space should be improved.

Plus it scrapes bottom with a dusting of snow.

I did attend a M-B event that had an AWD demo drive. They had a wet tarp and let you go out in a diesel RWD, then an E350 4Matic.

The diesel exaggerated the traction problem because after a little lag the power comes on strong, and breaks traction easily. The result was jerky, like the car had hiccups, traction control cutting in.

The AWD model was a smoother V6, back then pre-DI with less than 270hp, but linear power delivery. No problem on the slick tarp."

The Miata is ultra responsive. I can control speeds in tiny increments, even ""brake"" by reducing throttle position. Makes it very easy to position the car exactly where you want it.

Hills are the downfall of RWD in snow, especially if not equipped with winter/snow tires.

Last winter a friend came over to our house after a 2 inch snowfall and we had not cleared it yet and it was not a ""wet"" snow. He has a recent 3 series coupe with all-seasons on it. He struggled up our uphill winding paved driveway many times sliding off. He was persistent, kept backing up trying over and over, finally got to the top.

On the other hand, we have no problem getting up our driveway in winter with our front drivers and snow tires mounted. Of course do not even try going up the driveway if fresh snowfall is higher than our vehicles' ground clearance."

RWD would actually work better than FWD if there's weight on the rear axle."
3125	October 16, 2012 10:36AM	fintail	My normally aspirated car isn't like that. It just requires more pressure than a normal car. But the response is like any other high torque engine - the more you press, the more you get. There's no point like in a VTEC car where it explodes after a certain RPM, or like a low tech V6 where it runs out of breath after 4500. It just keeps going and going - 100-120-140 and so on.

Agreed. And still today in 2012.

Our State allowed studded snows for a handful of years. Put them on our RWD cars at 4 corners and the traction and handling in snow and ice was amazing compared to just plain snows. Of course, the studs ripped up the pavement and the State then banned use of these.

Downside to studded snows was on dry pavement at speed on interstate. Handling and feel was compromised quite a bit and with sustained speed, studs tended to fly out after some thousands of miles on the tires.

Ultimate setup, if still allowed in any State, would be studded snows at 4 corners on an AWD such as Subaru or Audi."
3129	October 16, 2012 10:50AM	xrunner2	"Few people out here even own snow tires. I learned my lesson. Unless conditions look pretty ideal, I will just stay home.

Think that is true here in northern Illinois.

If one can work from home on snowy days, then can get along with just all-season tires. Highway depts here are pretty good at scraping down and plowing roads soon after any snow.

But, we prefer to always be prepared, Have 3 vehicles, each with its own set of snow tires mounted to dedicated rims (Tire Rack)."
3130	October 16, 2012 11:02AM	stever	Can still do that in Alaska. But the studs mostly paid off in the city starting from a standing start at the black ice intersections. Helped with stopping at red lights too, but I remember sliding out into a few of them even so.
3131	October 16, 2012 11:08AM	fintail	"In those, meaning my car? It is insanely easy to drive in a mellow fashion, especially for such a powerful car. But I have driven it for so long now, I know all the shift points by memory, and how to maxinmize smoothness. Some cars aren't built for it, via design or driver.

Where in an old V6 GM car, I remember the smallest touch of throttle would shoot it off the line, where in a VTEC Civic it is like some motorcycles - you have to wring it a bit to get moving, and when you hit a certain point, it takes off like a normal car."
3132	October 16, 2012 11:10AM	fintail	"Road works departments here aren't so great when it snows - as it doesn't snow much, the infrastructure isn't there. I don't want to daily drive an SUV or switch tires, so I am happy with what I do. On snow days, my office is usually barren, as it should be. Overpaid ""leadership"" will always call in, so should everyone else."
3133	October 16, 2012 11:51AM	ateixeira	"Yes, AMG. I figured it would be.

In the late 80s I used to valet park for beer money. Those GM V6s would *jump* off the line, then wheeze and run out of breath. Totally on/off throttle control. Terrible."
3134	October 16, 2012 3:52PM	fintail	"Most MB had the feature of selectable 2nd gear start, which can make things even smoother. I seldom use it in my car, only in snow. I had it out on the highway today too - cruises like a dream, yet had enough reserve power on tap to stroll to the 155mph governor without breathing hard. And I averaged 25.1mpg.

My grandma had an Olds like that. I remember the first time I drove it, I shot forward (I was inexperienced, and used to driving a fussy carb'd 66 Ford which also had a heavy throttle). I can't see how a little old lady drove it smoothly."
3135	October 16, 2012 4:45PM	explorerx4	"The only time I didn't make it to work due to snow, it was because I was too tired after 4 hours of snow removal, to make a lane to get out of the driveway.
It was another 2+ hours to clear enough snow for my '02 Explorer to get out.
Last February, we went Indiana to visit one of the kids at school.
Took the then less than a year old Explorer, which I had never driven in snow.
Hit the snow about 20 miles from home and couldn't see anything for about 45 minutes.
Completely forgot it has 'snow mode' and despite all season tires, never slipped up other than almost going off the road a couple of times.
Good think for those rumble strips they build into the side of the highway.
Little did we know we were leaving 11 days without power behind us."

Even in the rain, we switch it to 4WD to keep from spinning the tires off the line. We get some good snowstorms here in Wisconsin, I've always had a rear-drive car (T-Bird, Lincoln LS, now a 2012 Mustang,) if the weathers bad, one of us will call in and the other will take the 4WD.

Per wikipedia:

In Europe, requirements for snow tires vary by country: in Austria, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Norway, Romania, Slovenia and Sweden, the use of snow tires is a legal requirement during winter months (usually November to mid-April) or if snow or slush is present on road surfaces: failure to comply can result in on-the-spot fines from the police."

Now I just have a winter car."

The last car on which I performed this ritual was my 1989 Mercury Grand Marquis and that was in November 1997. I still had a set of studded snow tires with nice wide whitewalls I bought in 1989. These snow tires lasted a long time because I worked locally and they were on the car a short time each year. PA state law mandated studded tires couldn't be on a car earlier than November 15th or later than April 15th."
3148	October 19, 2012 7:50AM	fintail	"Even here at many times of the winter in the mountains, it is ""traction tires required"" (or sometimes more) - if you crash and lack said tires, you get a ticket."

The guy from dirty jobs cable show is interviewing a woman employee at a Ford dealership asking her questions. They are obviously inside a building, Ford dealership, and he has his baseball type cap on while the lady, Fiorina, has not a cap or hat. There is no sun or rain and the guy has a cap. This is disrespectful of women. Wearing a cap in their presence.
3151	October 19, 2012 7:37PM	roadburner	"So, what kind of tires do you use when you go on the road rallies in Alaska?


In 2000 we ran studded Pirelli Scorpios S/Ts; back then there were only a few 18"" tires that were even remotely suitable. We managed to fit 100 studs per tire, but some of our competitors were running tires with a much higher stud count."

I suspect this G will end like the E90 3er, with a lot of unsold stock at the end of the last model year. Current one goes back to the 07 model year, one of the oldest designs still on the market. There will be some lease bargains no doubt. The unseen G25 will be even cheaper.

Now Toyota - maybe only in Canada, I don't know - is doing the exact same thing in an ad for the Tundra. Only in this case it's a mechanic-type guy, and he stretches the crankshaft, the brake rotors and calipers, and the body.

Any how, I guess the Audi Christmas lights ad appealed to the demographic and M-B had to respond, get pretty lights on its face, too.

Since we now have an Explorer in addition to the Odyssey, I can say that the van has more efficient packaging than the CUV. Yes CUV's are sold partly on image but then again so are luxury/performance cars. Driving an E63 AMG as a daily commuter in stop and go traffic is no different than doing the same thing in a Tahoe. 99% of those vehicles will never be used for what they are intended. They are bought and driven to convey an image."

Doesn't block view, is much less likely to kill people in a normal car if the driver runs a light, doesn't suck down as much fuel, isn't a problem in parking garages, etc. A far greater percentage of performance cars are sunny day drivers rather than commuter grinders too, no doubt. I'd rather drive on roads full of high performance cars (or minivans, or penalty box cheap cars, eyc) than on roads full of tall ""utility"" vehicles.

Ideally, the really big models would require license endorsements."

Wife and I helped move some relatives at two different times using both the ODY and Suburban taking loads. The ODY very clearly has the greater hauling capacity. It also rides and handles better than the Suburban."

Yeah, the gauges would take some getting used to.

The Sonic I drove was an LT model and stickered for exactly $17K. With discounts and rebates, figure another grand or so off.

I prefer the LTZ trim level myself, which starts to nudge $20K.

With the average vehicle transaction now in excess of $30K, you could get a pretty decent car and a bike for that amount.

I'm hoping the Fiesta ST comes in with a sticker in the low 20's."

3333	December 20, 2012 9:36AM	ateixeira	"Many modern 4cyls can outperform old 6cyl cars, if not V8s

In some ways better, but there are trade offs.

Fuel efficiency and torque are definitely there, but most give up smoothness and responsiveness, particularly in the case of BMW going from a silky inline six to a shaky 2.0T. Start/stop on that thing shakes the whole car.

We may be a generation or so away from then tuning in more smoothness, but even then the instant throttle response won't quite be there. I just remember a short autocross course in a 330i and how you could use the throttle to accelerate and even slow gradually (engine compression) to get through the course, with a RIGHT-NOW response to that throttle that you just can't get from the new engine.

When big engines are gone we'll still be nostalgic for larger displacement engines.

We'll also miss hydraulic power steering when they're all electric. Heck, Miata owners complain that the no power assist option is gone!"
3334	December 20, 2012 9:37AM	ateixeira	"GM put DI on all the engines, plus they got modern transmissions, too.

I think it's the styling that seems too similar to many folks."
3335	December 20, 2012 9:45AM	fintail	The start/stop can be disabled though. And make those engines diesel, and get enough torque to smooth things out a bit. There's no complete replacement for displacement, but the writing is on the wall. Even the highlines are moving downward in size.

3355	December 26, 2012 11:13AM	ateixeira	The SUVs maybe, but the G sedan and coupe have aged well. I like the original M better than the updated ones, though. It was more of a muscle sedan.

The styling needs refinement. The front, while not as edgy as Lexus, is still kind of off and derpy."
3357	December 26, 2012 11:41AM	ateixeira	"Hard to sell an FX for more money than the JX when it's much smaller inside. Infiniti's crossovers strategy had failed big until the JX.

3358	December 26, 2012 12:01PM	fintail	"FX was something special when it was introduced, but it got old, and the new style one isn't a nice design. JX seems to be a useful vehicle, and isn't too odd to look at.

Pointless can sell, though, just look at the X6."

X6 has other things going for it - huge price and ostentation factor, which is prized in this new gilded age. Looking like a clueless [non-permissible content removed] seems to be a competitive sport for many of the mysteriously monied, today."
3361	December 26, 2012 3:32PM	toomanyfumes	They really need some new models here, but what they really need is a competitive mid-size.

Such as showing a Benz on a Hollywood movie set with a car/driver sliding on gravel in that make believe street scene. Not too smart. Or a 5 series with a guy driving with his coffee cup empty and his sunroof open and a military type plane flies low with a boom extending to fill up his coffee cup that he is holding up through his sunroof. Or another commercial for a BMW sliding around on beach, ripping it up and throwing up sand. Or a Benz commercial having its suv crash through a wall.

This might all be OK if you were selling something to dopey teenagers who like this nonsense. But, that is not who buy these kind of vehicles."

3366	December 27, 2012 7:54PM	fintail	I've never seen anyone in advertising rave about those old non-car commercials. And then the old Q itself was easily trounced by the LS in sales, one reason being nobody had heard of it due to weird ads. I think that ad got the company off on the wrong foot. Since, it is seen as something nice, but odd.
3367	December 27, 2012 7:56PM	fintail	"Dopey commercials, record sales. That's all that matters. I'd rather see both brands do more heritage themed spots, but they already seem to know what sells. Cash talks, something else walks.

EX V6 AWD, plus Premium and Limited packages, so you have Pano, heated leather, Navi, backup cam, and I'm at $35,850 with freight.

You'll probably deal down to around $32k if you have any negotiating skills at all. Edit: $31,891 per TrueCar, and that's just an average deal.

MD tax is 6%, so I'm out of there still nicely loaded for under $34k. Still room to buy 2 iPads so each kid has one, and I'm still under $35k with rear seat entertainment.

In a Pathfinder that number would start with a 4.

Ody Touring Elite is $45 grand.

That's true, prices have inched upward but for that you're getting a bigger moonroof, a bigger Nav screen, a longer warranty, and basically equivalent everything else (competitors become more and more alike). Heck, most non-lux competitors don't have DI yet, even Pilot and Highlander.

So you're still getting more for less."

Edmunds analyzed Internet traffic during the Super Bowl to gauge which ads resulted in large traffic spikes during the broadcast. The consideration lifts are measured against the average of the previous four Sundays on Edmunds.com. The analysis quantifies how well the Super Bowl ads resonated with viewers.

The only way you could get more granular is to break it out by different trim lines or zip codes or something like that.

If I see a new Genesis in traffic and turn my head to look at it, I am not necessarily ""considering"" it.

Still don't buy the ""consideration"" term. ""Curiosity"" might be more accurate - but it sounds less severe and would gain less money from the accountants.

Regarding the pricing, there's a lot of ego and prestige in having a product aired during that game, too. It might trump logical decisions."

One very dear friend of mine was raised on a cattle farm in Montana and another in Colorado. Both were treated with full military honors upon their return home with a ""real"" American flag draped over their caskets. Both of them joined the military following the attack on ""real"" Americans, September 11, 2001. They were two farm raised country boy ""real"" Americans fighting for their homeland.

The woman does not need a cap or hat but a guy, maybe a macho guy, needs a cap. A cap for what? So, maybe Ford can defend this by saying the guy was not wearing his cap backwards. The commercial loses legitimacy by a guy wearing a cap and disrespecting a woman. Is this guy bald and trying to protect his image while disrespecting women?

OTOH, if the viewer finds the commercial offensive, VW can clearly demonstrate its not supported by the company and would prefer to have it removed, but due to the complexity of the Internet, free speech laws, etc., its been unable to do so.

I've got it set up on my DVR and have watched a few episodes so far.

Been interesting that of the 3 episodes I've seen, 2 were for independent used car lots and the 3rd was for a Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep dealer in NJ.

While I'm sure the problems portrayed on the show are real, some of the filmed interactions with salespeople and customers seems a bit staged.

Tom is a big fan of training - whether it's staff or management, he's able to get to the heart of the problem.

And, like both ""Restaurant: Impossible"" and ""Bar Rescue"", I'm sure that there will be times when the lessons Tom leaves them with won't be fully implemented."

I do, however, think its a good show for salespeople to watch. There are some decent tips relayed each show. I think one of my favorites was just called past customers to say happy bday. That's brilliant, IMHO. Keeps your name top of mind with your customers and, as long as you don't mention business during such a call, reinforces that a call from you is NOT a call that needs to be avoided."

I bet a good negotiator could land a loaded V6 Genesis for that advertised price even without loyalty and military and grad etc rebates, just to move one along.

Car Pros sells for less, C-A-R-P-R-O-S"
189	March 16, 2013 7:41AM	ateixeira	"Does anything non-Korean sell for near MSRP?

There is a glut of capacity, so besides a few exotics with wait lists, every car is discounted today."
190	March 16, 2013 8:29AM	fintail	I don't know of many 44K cars that can be had for 33K, no matter their origin. That's a greater percentage and raw numbers both discount than I got on an outgoing MB that is already known to be discounted.
191	March 16, 2013 12:30PM	ateixeira	"You sure he didn't trade a $5k car in that deal?

I looked at Fitzmall and the discounts here are about half as much, $5k or so off list.

They're asking $35k around here and thats with some incentives i would not qualify for (loyalty).

Still no profit in that price, though."
196	March 17, 2013 2:22PM	fintail	I saw the ad again last night - it was 44K MSRP, 34K screamer offer, there actually wasn't any fine print - that was just the price. When's the new one due? Maybe there's a glut, as I doubt the fleets want the high model. I bet a base can be had for 25K now easy.
197	March 17, 2013 3:02PM	ateixeira	"I think this is the last model year. Don't quote me but we may get a preview at the NY show in April.

I bet they spoil it by over styling it and raising the price. The current one is a sleeper and a bargain. I haven't seen prices below 30 and I do look every once in a while.

Before the DI V6 arrived I did see $27,900 specials, though."
198	March 17, 2013 3:06PM	fintail	Oh yeah, they will overstyle it. It might even be a reaction to the current somewhat understyled E60-derived design - and I am not saying understyled is bad. Raising the price could be a dangerous game, but it might also finally empty a slot for the Azera, which is in a tough position right now.
199	March 17, 2013 3:13PM	ateixeira	Azera is in no mans land, so they will likely move the Genesis upscale.
200	March 17, 2013 3:20PM	fintail	"Which is a risky thing too - although maybe the US market is big enough to support it. Price the Genesis in German territory, and most of the developed world won't go for it.

Is there an Azera commercial airing now? I've seen a few new ones on the road."
201	March 17, 2013 3:26PM	stickguy	"the Azera really serves a different purpose (market niche) even though it is similar in size and price. I look at it as similar to Lexus with the ES and GS.

I remember when the genny was coming out, my friend that works for corporate (so I got to see all the new models 3-4 months before they were in the dealers) had one, and he told me that he preferred the Azera, because it was a more cushy ride. So, appealing to the older (Buick/Avalon) set instead of the younger, ""euro"" crowd."
202	March 17, 2013 3:33PM	ab348	Well, it's cheap. It may be no bargain though. Long-term quality in Hyundais still seems to be a crapshoot.
203	March 17, 2013 5:08PM	ateixeira	"Azera is in the 30s I think, but it only comes loaded. Edit: 29.5 to 35 or so.

There's still plenty of room below the E and 5. They can find a sweet spot in the 40-45k range."
204	March 17, 2013 6:18PM	fintail	"I'd wager 95% of Genesis transaction prices are no more than in the 30s, and Sonata can creep up close when loaded. Lots of product in that range, and you step into legitimate premium badges without much more increase.

New one will need to be something of a revelation.

Just saw the commercial again. Clearing out inventory no doubt."
205	March 18, 2013 8:20AM	ateixeira	"Took a peek, there's way too much overlap. Pretty much starts at a grand more than the Azera, and median price is about where the Azera leaves off, so 50% overlap. The 5l V8 peeks in to the low 40s. 10% of them were in the 40s (you were close).

Drop the base V6, make the premium package standard, and they would not overlap.

No way no how I'd ever pick an Azera over a Genesis.

The only Sonatas in the $30s are the hybrids, so that model is about where it should be. If we exclude the hybrid it doesn't overlap with the Azera at all.

When the new Genny comes out the lineup should be sorted out in terms of price, with little/no overlap."

209	April 4, 2013 8:19AM	fintail	A couple commercials being aired a lot right now are kind of annoying. Any Honda ad with whistling style music in the background - seems to be a dorky ploy put people at ease, as if a car is so worrisome and stressful. Whistling makes troubles go away! And VW commercials featuring annoying early 30-somethings - guy has to have faux scruff (the last gasp of masculinity his owner allows) and a collared shirt with a sweater or similar. I think the ad copy business is ran by hipsters.
210	April 4, 2013 9:27AM	xrunner2	Would have thought VW would move on from their silly commercial of 3 guys out for a ride in a VW beetle convertible on a cold day with top down. The driver goes into a store and scares people with his mask on. Too many commercials apparently written by teen-age boys and for teen-age boys who don't have money or job to buy a new car.
211	April 4, 2013 9:46AM	ateixeira	Creepy ad, doesn't make you want to buy any car at all.
212	April 4, 2013 11:03AM	fintail	A lot of middle aged guys are just teenaged boys who haven't moved on. When their leash-holding wife or daughter makes them buy that Beetle, the commercial will make them think it's something other than what it is.

TL is kind of apples to oranges - not the top model, and the 04-08 was a clean design with usually reasonable prices. This new age RL looks like a 5:4 scale Accord, has enough headlights for 6 cars, a beak - and costs as much as the Germans. It has some interesting tech, but I don't know if they are going about this the best way."

Yeah, but when your sugar comes in little brown cubes roughly the color of my 2000 Park Ave, instead of a a ten-pound bag that says ""Kirkland"" or ""Richfood"" on it...THAT's luxury! :P

Funny thing is, I have a friend who's somewhat like that...with one exception. He's anything BUT car-conscious. He won't balk at paying $1,000 for a bike (my last bike came from WalMart about 14 years ago), and I doubt if it was $100), $100 for a dress shirt (I don't even know how much a dress shirt is ""supposed"" to cost, as I always get a few from my Mom and stepdad for Christmas, and she'll always buy them throughout the year, on sale, and then give them to me), buy the latest and greatest electronic crap on a whim, and so on. And, I don't know if it's ""luxury"", but I think his coffee maker was around $100 or so. We always buy the $20-25 model and when it breaks, to quote Eazy-E, say oh brutha, throw it in da gutter, and go buy anotha'. But, he doesn't even own a car.

You can sort of get away with no car in DC though. Heck, you could get away with it out here once upon a time, but they shut our branch of the WB&A down back in 1935, pulled up all the track in 1939, and sold it to the Japanese.

CLA is an A-class econohatch with a trunk. CLS is an E with a racy body and a 50% markup. It can work for many cars.
I think Jag and Maserati will go for flamboyant ads, they are looking to attract for attention as they play an underdog role in the market. Ads for the big 3 Germans are usually pretty subtle.

One problem with that.... Modern diesel engines barely make a whisp of smoke. Heck, one could sit in a closed garage wih an idling disel and NOT get CO poisoning. (Even a modern gasoline engine will kill you) The last diesel I saw 'belching' was a 1960's era bulldozer.

Diesel tech may be doing great on the new Mercedes' lot with all the Ad Blue stuff, but we're years away from the new tech trickling down to the older fleet of pickup trucks and bigger rigs out there.
So yeah, other than good mileage and towing grunt, I don't see much to admire about diesels. And diesel fumes happen to be an asthma trigger for my wife.

I found the commercial funny, and in an apparent effort to differentiate an Audi buyer from your typical German car-buying demographic.

I don't really find German car drivers to be bad though, my higher than usual ratio of bad driver offenders come from Toyotas. Toyota drivers seem to be a menace in the streets. Not all of course, but a higher number than usual. Maybe it is because Toyotas are so popular in CA."
517	April 26, 2015 7:07PM	fushigi	It's because Toyota became the brand of choice for former Saturn owners. Basically Toyota drivers are the ones who seek appliance vehicles. They don't have any passion for the act of driving. They're also the reason that Toyota doesn't have to have class-leading vehicles to get segment-leading (or nearly so) sales.

519	April 26, 2015 7:16PM	fintail	"Toyota drivers have more bad drivers because there are more Toyotas in many areas than other cars - if x% of drivers are bad, more of them will be in Toyotas. Combine that with the brand appealing to those who don't care about driving, the lowest common denominator regressing to a mean, and there we go. Whenever I am stuck behind a Prius or Corolla, I pay extra attention, and usually catch something dumb or just slow.

In Canada, I see there is a new set of Toyota ads featuring real owners, and they are as painful as the ones from the US a few years ago (Canada always seems to be following in some areas). Doesn't make me want to buy one, I will say that. Cars for people who don't like cars, or driving, or paying attention.

In my area, definitely a minority of BMWs are sold with the turn signal option package, and I think the local Audi dealer also deletes that option when ordering their fleet, too.

To be fair they did earn a reputation and perception of flawless or near flawless 6 figure mileage runners that wouldn't require any fixings for a long, long time. Cheap to own, cheap to maintain, or in other words, easy to maintain. They also are typically comfy, soft, quiet, and cushy.

Overall they're cheap enough to operate & reliable enough that a significant percentage of Chicago taxis are Camry Hybrids & Priuseseses. My point, though, is more about the average Toyota buyer, the demographics they attract, than the vehicles.

To be honest I don't put much stock in the 100K figure. Since the mid-80s I've only had 2 cars that didn't sail past 100K miles. A Mercury Topaz (comfortable but horribly unreliable) and a Camry.(AT failed at 62K miles). Even the Renault Alliance my dad gave me made it to 137K (though it was falling apart by then)."

That may be true in general, but as the (former) owner of 4 Saturns, Toyota was never on our radar when we moved on to a newer car.

I've bought a total of one vehicle from a Toyota dealer and that was because the used car sales manager was a friend of mine (well, he still is a friend; he just doesn't work there anymore). We had our choice of black Camrys (Camries?). Same year one was a lower mileage SE and the other a higher mileage XLE. If I'd pulled my ""hear, dear you'll love this"" we'd have bought the SE but instead I did the ""well, you'll be driving it; pick what you like."" Oh, well.

On Buick. There's a certain irony with me and Buick. For years they wanted to lower their buyers age and I'd have loved to find one that spun my chair.

When the ""Free Lease"" was up, you could turn it back in and the teen would now have 2 years of payments built up and could use that on the purchase of a new vehicle on their own.

Anthony Michael hall didn't reprise his role in the 3 sequels so why should he be in this movie? Besides, AMH isn't relevant to today's audiences. Ed Helms plays Rusty and Christina Applegate is his wife.

Nissan commercials have been awful for years. Aside from what you described about their agency, which I have no doiubt is true, I think they must be allied with a CGI shop because all of their ads use it in the most obnoxious ways and have for years.

I remember one ad where a hipster guy in the background didn't say anything, but had a look on his face like ""I can't believe this stuff, I'm embarrassed"".

746	April 2, 2016 3:29PM	Mr_Shiftright	Here's an interesting commercial from Russia. No video tricks--it's the real deal. I think the ad is actually for a driving school. The cars I'm not sure of, maybe some kind of Mitsubishi and a Citroen?
747	April 2, 2016 3:53PM	stickguy	the white one is a Mitsu. and that was some pretty impressive driving.

Judging by dashcam videos, I didn't know such car control was possible in Russia, I assumed some kind of magnetic waves made it all go random"
749	April 3, 2016 12:00PM	toomanyfumes	Outlander looks just like mine.

Just passed 52K miles Saturday. Weather was rain then sleet then snow then hail then sunny all with winds of 20+ MPH with 50 MPH gusts."
752	April 5, 2016 1:08AM	toomanyfumes	Yup, same weather up here. (I'm about 90 miles North of Chicago. ) I remember when that body style came out in 2007, seeing the commercials and thinking it looked pretty sharp. We like to think we aren't influenced by advertising, but those commercials made me look at a lesser known brand like Mitsubishi. Yeah, iluv, it's been trouble free in 95k other than tie-rod ends.

Yeah, the rats gotta eat too..."
758	April 5, 2016 6:48PM	berri	I'm sure that epoxy on concrete is nice in your dry climate. But for anyone in a damp climate, you may want to spot check it before applying it. While better on concrete than paint, that epoxy application can sometimes be a problem over time in wetter climates or the Midwest. We've had several neighbors that applied it in the Midwest and they all to reapply it every year or two. But it does look nice when it's fresh.

762	April 5, 2016 7:05PM	stever	"Just closer to town. Probably.

No offers yet, just a second walk-through today, three months after the first one. But two hot leads from a simple ""make me sell"" blurb on Zillow is pretty good (had two or three realtors email wanting a listing, but we aren't actively putting it on the market).

We wanna be closer to town, where the TV reception is better so the commercials will come in more clearly (better net bandwidth would be nice....)."
763	April 6, 2016 1:03AM	iluvmysephia1	Closer to Mesilla Mall, perhaps? And/or NMSU.
764	April 6, 2016 5:54AM	stever	Living in/near Mesilla would be great, very walkable/bikeable. The college not so much. Downtown is kind of funky but that's possible too.
765	April 6, 2016 8:05AM	Mr_Shiftright	Oh, no, don't ever live too too close to a college.
766	April 6, 2016 10:02AM	PF_Flyer	"Too late, I've been living too close to a college since 1974! Speaking of the 70's, just saw a movie I hadn't seen since it was first out in 1976, The Man Who Fell To Earth. Weird flick with David Bowie, Buck Henry, Rip Torn, but in one scene there was a car commercial on a TV, and sure enough, YouTube comes through. Sort of presages ""hypermiling"""
767	April 6, 2016 7:41PM	iluvmysephia1	You saw it, PF, excellent. I watched it on one of our DirecTV movie channels while we were in Moses Lake, WA, would've been about a year ago. Strange movie, for sure. Liked the NM setting, around Artesia, NM, for the scenes where David was living in the hotel.

What's odd about the first time I saw it was that it wasn't in a theater, but in my dorm area commons in 1976. That's the year it came out, so maybe there was a promotional push of the film on college campuses. But I hadn't seen it anywhere in the 40 years since, until yesterday"

Whether it be the power tool one or the debaged Malibu being mistaken for a BMW/Audi/Lexus, it's loathsome. Maybe in good company with most Nissan ads over the past decade, and sappy Subaru ads."

786	May 15, 2016 11:15AM	roadburner	"I remember a few Ford and Chrysler campaigns in the '80s that compared their cars to BMWs. And, like the Granada campaign, 30-40 years on, which cars are remembered as classics? A Granada with a fancy ""Euro"" trim package?"
787	May 15, 2016 3:06PM	Mr_Shiftright	Well you could tell the difference once you opened the door and closed it. Ka-CHUNK versus THWANG!
788	May 15, 2016 6:43PM	berri	Well guys, they talk about those ad's while laughing!
789	May 16, 2016 7:49AM	sda	A friend of mine in high school had a 76 Granada with the 250 six. It seemed to be a nice car at the time, however it had no power, and you had to saw at the wheel to keep it in the lane. True to Fords at the time, it was quiet, soft riding and had a cold a/c. He wrecked it when he entered a curve too quickly and plowed some trees. Did I mention poor handling?? No injuries, Granada totaled.
790	May 16, 2016 8:52AM	ab348	"Well, the Granada was (I believe) the last variant of the old Falcon/Maverick/original Mustang platform to be produced by Ford. So it had the typical Ford slow, numb power steering, wallowy handling, terminal understeer, and poor chassis dynamics that most of those vehicles had back then. The ""saw at the wheel to keep it in the lane"" comment above was exactly true of our Maverick as well - any speed over 50-55mph felt decidedly unstable."
791	May 16, 2016 8:03PM	berri	I remember having several first gen Granada/Monarch rentals and recall them being overly firm and stiff to drive. Not very comfortable at all. Never experienced the latter models though.
792	May 18, 2016 2:24PM	toomanyfumes	A friend of mine had a low mileage Granada in the early 90's. I remembered the Mercedes comparison ads, he looked them up in the library or somewhere. (Pre-Internet.) We always called it the Mercedes after that, it was a burgundy two-door in really nice shape, totalled when someone turned in front of him. He actually got a decent settlement after fighting with the insurance company, he had spent a lot on repairs.
793	May 18, 2016 5:15PM	ab348	This commercial is running in Canada for the Hyundai Tucson - not sure if it also airing in the US. The music is different and I quite like it!

I don't recall any stories of him having any problems with it, and the Seattle climate is easy on those cars. I think it replaced an earlier Corolla.

It'll be interesting to see how Ford counters. Chevy car ads are still pretty awful, this isn't much different.

Most trucks I see will never have more than a case of pop thrown in the back.
I'd like to see all the still alive former and current CEO's of Ford get into an F150 and all the former and current CEO's of GM get into a Silverado and go at each other head on and collide at 25 MPH each for a healthy 50 MPH collision.

Being able to ride over railroad tracks at 100 MPH without spilling a drop of liquid from a cup filled to the rim.
Getting excellent MPG's
Saving money over the life of the car from low maintenance and repair costs.
Pretty good resale value.
Quiet interiors
Really no reason marketing has to pretend they are still selling a bunch of Supras."
951	December 21, 2016 12:11PM	fintail	"I think some freshly cloned MBA types got together with a focus group and decided that boring isn't good, even if it still sells (Toyota could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot someone and not lose customers). There's an old adage that you can sell an old man a young man's car, but you can't sell a young man an old man's car. Even though much of the buying demographic is far from young, it's an ego thing. Nobody wants to admit they are buying boring but reliable.

The recent Toyolex styling direction is the same thing. For the most part, the vehicles still drive the same, but they now feature gobs of aggressive styling. Bold, I tell ya!"
952	December 21, 2016 1:06PM	berri	Selling sporty is kind of a young person pitch, but age and responsibilities such as family can change perspectives. There is a market danger I think if Toyota pushes sporty too much. The sell a lot of Camry's, so are people really wanting sporty and aggressive?

Judging by the amount of Camry's SE's and Corolla S's they sell, I suppose the answer is a resounding yes. At least, if a bigger tire/wheel and lower body moldings make a car sportier to some. Some people like to be ""pretenders."""

I hate it also, but if they are trying to appeal to young folks, it might be effective.   A lot of youngsters have never had to negotiate anything in their life - their parents always did it for them.  So, an easy buy process that doesn't suck might just make them use this place."

The ""law of the land"" rebuttal against Audi's point is tenuous, something being law doesn't mean it is actually practiced, or punished when broken. No doubt Audi is shamelessly pandering to a demographic, but I would rather call out that bit alone. Right now, I see some offended just as much as the snowflake set.

For Chevy, I suspect maybe they paid the ad agency a substantial fortune up front, and don't want to lose out on their initial investment, no matter how the product is mocked. I have yet to see any positive impressions of that ad campaign. Limited editions are always a bad sign, hinting at sales desperation or an outgoing model.

1082	April 2, 2017 4:44PM	ab348	I think the reason you see those weekly payment ads up here is because leases seem to be ridiculously expensive compared to the US market.

On a commercial communication related note, I received a flyer yesterday from a Cadillac dealer - closer inspection shows it from a Cadillac dealer from a notoriously screamer high volume outfit in Idaho, with special deals (but not so great) on 2016 models. They seem to be roughly 15-20% off MSRP, which IMO is too high for a prior year model in late May of the following year.

1256	January 3, 2018 8:33AM	ab348	"I get it that you hate them and agree they aren't great ads but hardly the worst. The ""sporty Camry"" grounded to the ground ad was arguably far worse.

Pretty much any Nissan horror movie ad would be near the top. Several Honda ads spike the annoyance charts. The list goes on."
1257	January 3, 2018 8:34AM	Mr_Shiftright	"As H.L. Mencken said: ""Never underestimate the intelligence of the American people"". So if the ads sell cars, that's all that counts. Bottom line, baby.

It's interesting to read car ads from 100 years ago. Back then, they were still into the utility of the car, not the image so much (a bit of it appears in the really expensive cars). But even with all the ""class"" of those vintage ads, they still lied like rugs. Things like ""Climbs the tallest mountains effortlessly, with smooth quiet power, effortless shifting, and unparalleled reliability"". In 1918? I don't think so."
1258	January 3, 2018 8:42AM	fintail	"Nah, the Malibu one is a farce, and the spots pandering to millennials or hipster types are up there too. The Malibu one where a ""not actor"" thinks it costs 80K, and is compared to something like a BMW-Tesla hybrid is just inexcusable. Are ""real people"" like this?

I actually thought the hamsters were creative - those spots didn't irk me. The Toyota hyperbolic platitudes are more irritating - ""sporty"" Camry, ""stylish"" Corolla and Prius, ""aggressively sophisticated"" Highlander, LOL. Next they will be the most bigly bestest cars ever, believe me.

80K Malibu LOL, MMakes me think of this"
1259	January 3, 2018 8:48AM	ab348	Many, maybe even most, people in the age group they feature are oblivious to cars. They may know brand names and have preconceptions about them but could not ID one if their life depended on it. In part that is what these ads try to get at - not saying a Malibu is as good as a Lexus or Audi or whatever, but that their preconceptions about how one might be designed and equipped weren't correct. I'm not sure why that offends you so.
1260	January 3, 2018 8:51AM	fintail	"Judging by the comments all over the web, not just on the Zebra Corner parodies, but virtually everywhere the ad campaign has been mentioned, it isn't just me who rolls their eyes to the point of being audible. I think the ads annoy anyone with basic knowledge of the market. 80K Malibu? Maybe for a member of one of the ""lost tribes"" who has been forced into this civilization and is just learning cars.

I am not sure why the Youtube videos mocking the dopey GM spots offend some others so"
1261	January 3, 2018 9:11AM	ab348	Simple. Because the parodies crossed the line of trying to be witty and funny a while ago and now are just crude and nasty.

Gutter is the sign of the times, look at the leadership"
1265	January 3, 2018 6:45PM	Mr_Shiftright	Yeah, but some of them are really disgusting. They are so gratuitously obscene that it makes you cringe.

I think the fact that GM continues with the lame ""Real People, not Actors"" campaign for so long and for so many attempts excuses the parodies from continuing to exist for so long and for so many attempts.

I think your right. I heard in the past NASA or others would just use concrete blocks or something similar as a ""test"" payload. Musk apparently found that boring and came up with the idea to put a Tesla in Space.

You're right about modern bumpers. The Alltrack damage estimate is a tad over $1,000, or a tad under if I leave the right rear taillight as-is. The small stress crack is not really a crack, but a stress mark, opinion is that it'll never expand or leak unless something else hits it again. Smooth to the fingernail test."

A PDR guy worked it over, and I can't tell where it was now.

If the crack is what I'm picturing from your description, I'd suggest using a little super glue that will wick into the crack and seal it. Wipe the superglue off IMMEDIATELY. You might test superglue on the plastic if there's a hidden corner to be sure it doesn't do something damaging quickly.

I'm assuming there actually is a crack to the outside. What you might be describing is a crack on the underlayer of plastic that doesn't exhibit at the surface. You might try a fine needle to see if there is a crack that your fingernail doesn't catch as it rubs over it."

Really, your dealership is that honest? It has nothing to do with Kias not having the hype/demand demand (few cars do) to justify an ADM? Sounds great.

I suspect there are many households here where two vehicles are an SUV and pickup or two pickups.

I think the Country/Rock & Roll ad is to grab attention from both types of music lovers, who may represent different age groups.

I want to comment too that ads are intended to be different or grate a little bit as a way of making it memorable. Not ""memorable"" as in ""great commercial"" but memorable as in people think about it and remember it. Seeing as how the ""actors, not real people"" ads got people talking about them, I think they served their purpose.

We've had car dealers who advertise in awful advertisements but get remembered when it's time to go shop. Same for a local carpet store guy hawking carpets. Even when he left the ad business, his replacement acts and appears to be similar in the ads for the company."

Honda provides engines for both Indy Car and Formula One, and Civics have raced successfully in the British Touring Car series for many years. If Chevy had done the same thing with one of their cars, you would not have an issue with it. Nor would I, since Corvettes race very successfully in IMSA and they provide engines for Indy Car and NASCAR."

If they were peddling Corvettes or Camaros, likely not: those are racing associated in my mind. But peddling a sedan using racing,that was based on the Civic platform according to the stories leading its showing, I take umbrage with.

Perhaps a BMW or Audi might get away with using a transformer race car into an up level chassis of one of those...

We've suffered all the folks complaining about certain GM topics in the ads about real people's responses, so I'm allowed to have my opinion of some of these other brands. It reminds me of the art appreciation class at BSU taught by Dr Goldman about how things should look like what they are.

I recall the ""Camry people"" (or similar) spots were widely mocked, a theme which featured random apparent Camry owners and made them look like dorks - one family with all of the kids driving Camrys was especially mockable (and I am saying this while my mom drives a Camry that I greenlighted). I remember a Scion ad late in the brand's run was mocked at pandering to youth a little too hard. Brand wasn't behind it, lame advertising made it happen.

""Real people"" was even worse though, as it made people who appeared to be wowed by Chevy look like morons. Do you want to be like those ""real people""? Maybe the only upside is that a lot of money was made by creative types (who could probably do better than GM's ad agency) from Youtube parodies.

Chevy Trailblazer
Buick Rainer
Olds Bravada
Izuzu Ascender
Saab 9X or something like that.
GMC Envoy

That just wasn't sustainable and the cuts were made. What I guess I'm trying to say is I don't think the product killed Olds, but the environment. GM did try and make Olds more like the imports, but the savvy buyers knew they were copies of everything else GM.

If you take the Intrigue for example, it certainly was the best of the W bodies in most ways but the public never really saw it that way and bought Camrys and Accords. Impalas and Grand Prix's got dumped into fleets and the Regal was bought by the traditional Buick demographic.

IMO if GMC didn't need something to sell at the dealers and the Enclave hadn't been as popular Buick may be gone as well."

The only time I might watch now is if the Leafs somehow pull a miracle and contend for Lord Stanley's battered old basin, so probably not much chance of that.

1540	February 3, 2020 5:55PM	fintail	"The NHL game certainly isn't what it used to be, hockey development at all levels is much different than even when I was young. I am happy when we see a flash of 90s style NHL play now and then - the Oilers/Flames game Saturday night is what passes for ""old time hockey"" in 2020, and it was a pretty fun game, reminded me of things 25 years ago. 1967 redux lol, keep hoping, those fans can be a punching bag, and I'd hate to play there. Yeah, the only thing like TSN/Sportsnet here if one subscribes to the NHL TV package, which if I completely cut the cable cord, I just might do. Without CBC, I'd get maybe a monthly US network broadcast, likely of teams irrelevant to my interests, and now and then one of the small affiliate stations here will carry a local WHL game, which in some ways is more fun than the show anyway.

I used to be a hockey fan when I was younger but when places like Columbus, Tampa and Phoenix got teams I lost interest. The only time I might watch now is if the Leafs somehow pull a miracle and contend for Lord Stanley's battered old basin, so probably not much chance of that. The hockey you see on CBC is limited compared to what the Canadian sports cable channels carry. They really are hockey-crazed, much like much of the country's populace is. Even in July and August the nightly Sportscentre broadcast on TSN usually leads with Leafs or other hockey news."

Ah... thanks."
1542	February 3, 2020 7:20PM	stickguy	not quite sure how long that is. 3 row? Could be on the G70 platform, maybe stretched a bit, is my guess.

Or, even off the G80?"
1544	February 3, 2020 8:56PM	stickguy	possible. I assumed the G70 since I think that was a fresh design, not a shrunken G80. but probably not a heck of a lot of difference once scaled up to CUV duty.
1545	February 4, 2020 5:49AM	tjc78	From what I have read, it’s based off the G80
1546	February 4, 2020 3:00PM	fintail	Groundhog Day themed Jeep ad was probably the best of the Superbowl. Porsche was cool too, trying to recognize the scenery, but as that movie is relevant to my interests, I got it.
1547	February 4, 2020 3:13PM	stickguy	I missed some of the game and never saw the Porsche commercial.
1548	February 4, 2020 3:41PM	andres3	If 6-year old girls was Audi's target market for the E-Tron ad, they succeeded.
1549	February 4, 2020 3:46PM	fintail	I saw that e-tron spot on another site. Atrocious.
1550	February 4, 2020 3:54PM	explorerx4	"A friend of mine who owns a couple of 911's, sent me a link to the commercial a few days ahead of the Super Bowl.
We both thought 'mildly entertaining', but not in the BMW Films ballpark."
1551	February 4, 2020 4:12PM	stickguy	yeah, that Audi spot was a bit odd.

The majority of people seem to ""get"" ads based on past movies, for either good or bad. Since I do not see very many of those though, the appeal is lost on me."
1553	February 5, 2020 10:44AM	fintail	"Groundhog Day is nearly 30 years old now, to my eyes kind of a classic with that 80s-90s comedy that just doesn't exist in new movies. As it featured other characters from the movie (the mayor - Brian Doyle Murray, and Ned Ryerson), it worked.

Yeah, that's the kind of guy that should have been canned as part of the ""bailout"" deal. Get rid of the old weight, bring in some better blood."

I have a stinking suspicion the suits are so full of themselves that they think it is a good theme, and will continue to run with it. At least the replacement is a complete lifer."

This aired a lot when I was a kid, and this bit always cracked me up. Still pretty amusing."

Several good lines - ""two tone rust"", ""absolutely no charge whatsoever except for parts, labor, and towing"", etc."

There has to be a case for a false advertising claim on this, right?"

Unfortunately stylish and fun are subjective terms with relativity at play. I remember a woman praising the Murano as like a ""sports car"" in the twisties to Enterprise upon return, as no doubt she was used to something that handled even worse.

I've driven the Murano; it was OK, and has a dreaded CVT."
