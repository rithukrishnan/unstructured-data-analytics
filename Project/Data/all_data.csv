It is spacious, isolated, nestled in tall trees, and provides a serene escape from the modern world. Inside, discover a well-equipped kitchen, a dining table with plenty of seating for mealtimes or game nights, and two comfortably-furnished living areas. Outside, dine al fresco in the gazebo or check out the view from the upper balcony. You can often see deer, foxes, eagles, and a variety of other birds just looking out of the window. In the garage game room, you'll find a Ping-Pong table for when you're craving a little friendly competition.

Shelter Cove offers breathtaking natural beauty that only the most undeveloped parts of the California coastline can provide. It is a perfect place for those looking to walk the rugged shorelines, enjoy peaceful beaches like the Black Sands Beach, explore the rich tide pools next to the lighthouse, hike the Kings Range’s steep mountain trails, or simply relax in nature. For food, we recommend the delicious, locally caught fish at Mi Mochima or the Deli’s unforgettable fish and chips. Gyppo Ale Mill also offers locally brewed beer and a good variety of seasonal entrees. You may also get live Dungeness crabs and fish from local fishermen.

The house is newly constructed and finished in Jan of 2020.  The architectural style is unique, in that it is built almost entirely of concrete with 12-inch walls and stamped concrete radiant heated floors. The house has four levels and 3350ft2. We are about 300 feet above sea level, and 1/2 mile from the water, which is just far enough from the water to have a safe place for kids to play and you get better weather (more sun, less wind, and fog), but you can still hear the sounds of the waves below. You are surrounded by a beautiful view of fir trees and lush green vegetation from the wetland that extends in the back of the property.  As you pull up to the house, you will see the entrance and a patio to the right. Some stairs take you to the main level and front door. You can also enter the house on the 4th level, which is a Movie theatre/game room. Here is a favorite spot to hang out and enjoy a game of ping pong or throw darts. Also, a floor to ceiling chalkboard is super fun for the kids. The movie theatre screen is 130 inches 3D /HD, and you have fantastic immersive surround sound. We have an assortment of 3D and regular blue rays movies. The system is also connected to DirectTV. There is a second 65 inch TV so that you can watch two games at the same time!You can bring your gaming system and easily connect to either TV with extra HDMI cables.This room can also serve as a 5th bedroom and has a queen futon, and we have two queen air mattresses. This room can sleep 4-6. If used as a bedroom, you can use the front door at the primary level to enter the house. Let’s continue the tour-You enter the central part of the house and descend several stairs to the 3rd level. The house has an open concept, so you are looking down into the great room and see the five massive windows that provide views of the forest and wetland. Overlooking the great room is the desk that is custom made from a slab of Walnut. You will have access to the 27inch mac for any work that you need to do during your stay. You will see many accents, railings, and shelves that are custom made from local hardwoods.  Also, you will see the 25-foot walls in the great room, clad with shiplap. The room has an open, light, and grand feel to it. Going past the desk leads you into the Master Bedroom. Here there are windows with shutters that open to the great room below. Also, a balcony off the master bedroom overlooks the backyard 20 feet below. You can listen to the waves from Black Sands Beach and watch the stars that are fantastically bright on the Lost Coast. The room has a king-size bed and a couch that opens into a queen bed. There is a 55 inch TV, and the room sleeps 4 comfortably. The bathroom ensuite in the master is very lovely with a soaker tub, his and her sinks and a large walk-in shower with a multi soaker shower.The stairs lead down to the main level of the house (level 2). Here you will see the Great Room that features power reclining couches and a 75 inch 4k TV with seven-speaker surround sound. We love to watch movies or listen to music. The sound system is connected to Alexa for voice commands, ""Hey Alexa Play Johny Cash."" The Kitchen extends the great room and has a massive island that is a favorite spot to watch the chefs cook the fresh catch of the day. The kitchen has all the amenities to cook a great meal. Also the great room as 2 kitchen tables, seating 7-8 at the main and six at the smaller. The total sitting spots, including the coach and island, is over 20. The dining area has a slider that leads to a covered balcony where you will find the BBQ and views of the forest. A spiral staircase just off the side patio will lead you to the back yard and 1st level. Back through the great room leads you past the front door and entryway to the guest room and second bathroom. The bathroom is clad with shiplap and has a bathtub and shower. The guest room has a queen bed with a view of the forest. There is a 55 inch TV. The room has a reading nook that can also serve as a twin bed and can sleep 3. Just to the right of the guest rooms is the linen closet, and adjacent to this is a walk-in pantry. We have a refrigerator here, where we keep our food. The  Kitchen has a pantry and pantry that will be empty for guests. From the main level, you go down to the first floor. There is a small art room where you can get your creative juices flowing. You can paint rocks, a picture, or make a shell board. Right next to the art room is the bunk room. A large barn door separates this bedroom and is an excellent spot for the kids or a family. The room has 2 bunk beds (full on the bottom and twin of the top). There is an entertainment system to watch TV or play movies on a  55 inch TV. The room has a super comfy carpet and a chalkboard on the wall. The sliding door leads you to the backyard witch we will go over in a few. This room sleeps 6.The room next to the bunk room is the 4th bedroom and has a queen bed and another reading nook that can serve as a twin bed. This room also has a 55-inch tv. The sliding door provides excellent views of the backyard and forest. The bathroom on the first level has a shower with multi-panel massage jets. The room adjacent to this is the boiler room. Here is the system that heats the house. The heating system wouldn't usually be something to mention in a rental, but this system is pretty cool. There is over a mile of pex tubing that runs under the stamped concrete floors. There are four zones in the house, each controlled with a Nest thermostat. The feeling of warm floors under your feet is lovely after coming back from a day at the beach. You can control the temperature of the house from the nest app or Alexa. We can remotely turn on the heat to your desired temperature before your arrival. The backyard has a covered stamped concrete patio with a hot tub to relax after a day at the tide pools. Also, a 600 FT2 turf lawn is a great place to enjoy a game of corn hole and is perfect for kids to play around on, without getting dirty. You don’t have the worries of being too close to the water if you have little kids. The grass is enclosed by a fence and is about 4 feet above the wetland. Here are some top things to do in Shelter Cove1. Visit the redwoods. If you are driving from the Bay Area, you can make a stop in Leggett, which has the drive-through tree. Just past Garberville is the Avenue of the Giants. There is also a small grove just past Redway on the way to Shelter Cove. This would be the closest grove to the house, which is about 20 miles; 35-40 min.2. Black Sand Beach- a great place to walk and watch the sunset. Not a swimming beach.3. Shelter Cove Beach- you can drive on this beach at low tide. A recommendation is to check the tides each day and plan accordingly. There are two low tides each day, with one being smaller than the other. We time our beach arrival or tide pools for low tide. This is an excellent beach for swimming, paddleboard, and kayaking. 4. Malcolm Park- this is is the area with the Lighthouse. We like to picnic here, and there is a huge picnic table that can seat 12 people. Take the stairs down to a small beach and tide pools, but check the tides so that you can time your arrival, and you are fortunate is you go on a negative tide. The tide pools extend from Molcoms and north for about 1/2 mile to Abalone point. The tide pools have amazing creatures and seals are all over the place. You can find some tremendous Abalone shells (don’t take live ones); also, you can pull mussels off the rocks and boil with white wine and butter.5. Golf- there is a nine-hole golf course around the runway. There are a couple of sets of old golf clubs that you can use. They are under the stairs. 6. Biking- Paradise Park is Mountain bike park that is about 5 miles up Shelter Cove road. This has single track trails and a bike park with obstacles. You can also ride bikes on the street in front of the house. 7. ATV- people like riding motorcycles and ATVs throughout the town and on the beach. You will see this more on holiday weekends and not so much during a typical week.  If you’ve got one, bring it, and you will enjoy it. 8. Fishing- Shelter cove is a well-known fishing spot. There is room to park a boat in front of the house. You can also charter a fishing boat from a couple of local operators. We have a fishing pole you can use with the kayak. 9. Whale Watching- Whale watching in Shelter Cove peaks in April and May during the grey whale’s migration down the Pacific Coast to warmer waters. You can charter a boat or watch the spouts from any number of picnic spots along the cove.10. Watch the planes land- Shelter Cove has a small runway.  There is no tower, and it’s not monitored. Private pilots will fly to Shelter Cove, which must be awesome. 11. Gyppos- this is our local brewery and restaurant. It overlooks the runway and golf course. They have an outside gas fire pit that is a favorite spot for a cold beer. They have live music and a helpful website that feature the activities for the week. They have corn hole and other games, and the kids can play on the grass around the golf course. 12. Fish Bowl- This is the local coffee shop, and a must-see on your trip. It’s located at the Inn of the Lost Coast. Great coffee and I love the salmon bagel with the works. The owners are super friendly and will give you tips or can connect you with charters or anything else. Autumn knows everyone and knows everything about the cove.13.Delgato Pizza- this is also located at the hotel. You can order a take out pizza from here, or they have a couple of tables outside. They also have baked goods. 14. Sky’s- this is the newest restaurant in the cove. Great tai food and incredible views. This is also a BYOB establishment so that you can save some $$ on your alcohol bill.15. Mi Mochimo- this is a cool Venezuela restaurant that is across from the Hotel. Great deck and unique dishes.",Garden view**__**Mountain view**__**Beach access**__**Kitchen**__**Wifi,,[],"['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/d1772310-ef76-4496-9fc8-b1888d778672.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/16251cdc-ad4d-4961-981e-0cc46be818b7.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/4f24b1fb-be1f-465a-8e6b-739ed022570b.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-39468275/original/55a74166-d594-449a-88fd-ea212debc110.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/d14f1092-3f5d-4ea6-a7e9-78fd479c97d5.jpg']",host data is not there

She was dark and dramatic and left home as soon as she could, living with her musical cousins in Petrolia and performing for guests at the Petrolia hotel. When the family decided to buy the ranch, Jessie and her husband Harold pitched in with all the dirty work, driving tractors, burning bushes, digging trenches. She assisted in the kitchen, at the Front Desk, cleaned rooms, washed laundry, and worked with the seamstresses.

Near VT's premier skiing, hiking, & outdoor adventures w/ 180+ view of VT's most majestic mountains. Perfect for summer vacations, stunning autumn foliage & ski retreats.The spaceLuxuriate in the serene elegance of Above the Clouds I -- relax in the travertine showers (one with 5 shower heads!), 2-person jacuzzi, or outdoor hot tub that faces west across the Mad River Valley; prepare a gourmet meal in a true cook’s kitchen outfitted with every appliance imaginable or use the Traeger wood pellet grill on the side patio; pamper yourself in the massage chair and hammock chair while watching a fire in the fireplace or woodstove (or both!); stroll through the extensive gardens; take a nap in the hammock; eat blueberries fresh off the bush; relax on the deck at sunset while sipping wine and watching hummingbirds wiz by... Though Above the Clouds is close to many of Vermont’s premier tourist destinations, there’s so much deliciousness here that there’s no need to go anywhere else!Located at the end of a quarter-mile-long driveway that passes through birch and hemlock woods you'll find yourself perched at the top of the world overlooking a glorious 180+degree mountain vista. Other than the adjacent guesthouse (located nearby but placed so both homes have privacy), the only signs of life are lights twinkling across the valley at night and the wildlife that shares the land and soars over the valley. Or, if you’re looking for accommodations for a larger party, rent both homes and sleep up to 13 people (click my host picture to see my other listing or see the listing for Above the Clouds II and Above the Clouds Retreat).Huge windows with amazing views grace every room in this 2500+ s.f. house and make the boundaries between the glorious outdoors and sumptuous indoors hard detect. With two sleeping wings (each with an en-suite, luxurious bathroom), two couples or a family of five can visit by day yet have complete privacy at night. Two more people can sleep in the cozy upper living room on a queen bed that pulls out of the leather sofa. Every room in the house is enhanced by original artwork, and all the fixings are the finest (cherry bedroom furnishings, sheepskin rugs and accents, TempurPedic mattresses, luxurious throws, leather furnishings, down blankets and pillows, etc.). The kitchen is a gourmet chef’s dream with a gas range, huge pantry decked out with every appliance imaginable (plus some more!), generous granite counters, a giant array of spices, and a Traeger wood pellet grill/smoker on the adjacent patio. The delectables you create can be eaten on the patio table that seats up to 8, in the dining room on the table that can seat up to 12, or in the cozy octagonal breakfast nook. Perhaps the best part is that there is an amazing view from every seat in the house. For your entertainment, the 65"" Samsung The Frame smart TV displays photos (most of which are nature shots that were taken by Bob) when not in use has access to most major streaming services as well as Samsung's television channels. There is a Bose bluetooth speaker for your digital music. For some old-fashioned fun, there is a generous store of books, puzzles, and board and lawn games. The gardens are as glorious as the inside of the house. If you can extract yourself from the cedar deck and patio furniture or 6-person hot tub, you'll want to wander and enjoy the extensive perennial gardens, relax by the water garden with fountain, play games on the lawns, or head off to hike on our 20 acres and adjacent trails. Seasonally, a dozen mature blueberry bushes and organic veggie and herb gardens can round out your dining selection.

Near VT's premier skiing, hiking, outdoor adventures. Sunset views, breathtaking vistas, calming atmosphere, artful aesthetic, attention to detail. Sumptuous deck furniture, outdoor shower, fire pit, & garden patio extend the summer experience. Fireplace, sheepskin rugs & indoor ski storage are perfect for ski retreats. COMPLETE COVID-19 CLEANING & SELF-CHECK-IN.The spaceAbove the Clouds, a stand-alone guesthouse with private entrance, was built with attention to every detail and a commitment to creating a peaceful, uplifting environment. While you're likely to travel to Vermont to partake in its natural beauty and outdoor adventures it's so lovely here that you may never want to leave.Located at the end of a quarter-mile-long driveway that passes through birch and hemlock woods you'll find yourself perched at the top of the world overlooking a 180+degree mountain vista. Other than the adjacent main house (located nearby but placed so both houses have privacy), the only signs of life are lights twinkling across the valley at night and the wildlife that shares the land and soars over the valley.The 1000+ square foot open-concept second story can sleep up to four, while the 250+ sf main room downstairs can sleep another two. Upstairs the hand-crafted wooden headboard, made from local maple, is a one-of-a-kind work of art that creates privacy for the queen-size master bed. It is situated so it has incredible views of the surrounding mountains and enjoys morning sunrises and evening sunsets. At the opposite end of the room, the reading nook has a sheepskin-covered daybed that can be separated into two twins or turned into a king-sized bed at night. The couch in the lower living room converts into a comfortable queen-size bed (plus a memory foam topper for those who want it). Though the room downstairs is only separated by the staircase, the downstairs sleeping area is private because of the layout of the house. All bed linens, towels, and pillows are hotel quality with both down and non-down options.Our spa-like bathroom has a shower large enough for two with both rainfall and hand-held showerheads, plus a pebble floor to massage your feet. The sink is made from a hand-carved boulder and sits atop a spalted maple live-edge counter held up by a birch tree base harvested from our property. The skylight overlooking the adjacent forest top fills the room with light. The live-edge wood sliding door is so beautiful you'll want to hug it. You have to experience it to understand... For those who want to bathe in the midst of Vermont's great outdoors, there is an outdoor shower that affords complete privacy and absolutely amazing views. The kitchen, with Euro-fridge and dishwasher, is equipped with gourmet appliances, including a fondue pot for a leisurely dining treat. There are incredible views from every window and a beautiful granite counter surrounded by comfortable leather bar stools.The living room, with views in every direction, adjoins an 8'x20' deck with clear walls, providing an amazing place for outdoor living high up in the trees. During warm weather, sleep under the stars on the sumptuous deck furniture; BBQ, dine, and use the firepit on the garden patio.  For your entertainment, the TV is hooked up to DirecTV and has a Roku and DVD player. There is a high-quality Bluetooth speaker for your digital music. For some old-fashioned fun, there is a generous store of board games, books, and puzzles.Both houses are powered by the sun and have high-speed fiber-optic internet (500 mbps up and down). We offer a complimentary Level 2 EV charging station.Note: On a limited basis, the main house -- Above the Clouds I -- can also be rented on a stand-alone basis or you can rent both homes to use for larger groups. For more information about the main house or renting both homes see the Airbnb listings linked with my profile. Please note, that while we rarely rent the houses to two unrelated parties at the same time, we may occasionally do this. When this happens, we introduce the families to each other and do our best to make sure everyone understands the need to respect each others' privacy and the importance of keeping it peaceful here. The houses are oriented in different directions, so this is an easy thing to do.",Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**TV with standard cable**__**EV charger,Entire home hosted by Marianne,"['Bathroom\nHair dryer\nCleaning products\nShampoo\nEO conditioner\nEO body soap\nOutdoor shower\nHot water\nShower gel', 'Bedroom and laundry\nFree dryer – In unit\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nExtra pillows and blankets\nRoom-darkening shades\nIron\nDrying rack for clothing\nClothing storage: dresser and wardrobe', 'Entertainment\nEthernet connection\nTV with standard cable\nBose Bluetooth sound system\nBooks and reading material', 'Family\nPack ’n play/Travel crib\nBaby bath\nChildren’s dinnerware\nFireplace guards\nOutlet covers\nBoard games\nBaby safety gates\nTable corner guards\nBabysitter recommendations', 'Heating and cooling\nIndoor fireplace\nCeiling fan\nPortable fans\nHeating', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nFire extinguisher\nFirst aid kit', 'Internet and office\nWifi\nPocket wifi', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nCooking basics\nPots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nMini fridge\nFreezer\nDishwasher\nStove\nOven\nHot water kettle\nCoffee maker\nWine glasses\nToaster\nBlender\nBarbecue utensils\nGrill, charcoal, bamboo skewers/iron skewers, etc.\nCoffee\nDining table', 'Location features\nPrivate entrance\nSeparate street or building entrance', 'Outdoor\nPrivate patio or balcony\nPrivate backyard – Not fully fenced\nAn open space on the property usually covered in grass\nFire pit\nOutdoor furniture\nHammock\nOutdoor dining area\nBBQ grill', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises\nFree street parking\nEV charger\nGuests can charge their electric vehicles on the property.', ""Services\nLuggage dropoff allowed\nFor guests' convenience when they have early arrival or late departure\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more\nHost greets you\nCleaning available during stay"", 'Not included\nUnavailable: Washer\nWasher\nUnavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning']","['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/8fbcf5b5-6a85-46dd-939a-e3ddfe56fc7d.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/2a7ab8d1-67ac-4d27-83c6-7d339726a399.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/e1cb2e38-2a5c-42f7-92b9-7889b3eb8555.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/412c4cb6-85b3-4e2d-b568-d4e9e606e774.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/ff4bdb29-a742-48fd-8851-f4f63f72a7c1.jpg']","Hosted by Marianne

This two bedroom unit has great mountain views and is centrally located between Waterbury and Stowe.  It is an ideal base camp for beer geeks, skiers, mountain bikers or anyone looking to experience the best Vermont has to offer.  It is located above Zenbarn - a very hip farm to table restaurant with lots of live music and an amazing Vermont Beer tap list and cocktails featuring the best Vermont distillers.The spaceDISCLAIMER:  At the risk of sounding rude please remember I don't need you to book this place.  I've been doing airbnb for almost a decade.  Ive found cool laid back travelers with a sense of adventure absolutely love my place and this accounts for 95% of my guests.  My life has become increasingly busy(2 business', two toddlers, multiple airbnbs) and help increasingly hard to find and my tolerance for nit picky guests who are gonna freak out over a stray hair, a tattered corner on a sheet or some other minor inconvenience is pretty much gone.   If you have an issue when you arrive by all means let me know and I will bend over backwards to resolve it but I'd love to find a way to get rid of the needy/whiney guest who ends up stressing me out and making me wish I didn't do Airbnb.  Remember this whole thing started with a guy renting out his couch in San Francisco for a few extra bucks.  If you love walking in to a hotel room and getting exactly what you expect I reccomend staying at one of the many awesome local hotels that would love your business.  If your just looking for a dope pad to crash and experience our cool little town come drink some beers and catch an awesome show or two  then please book with  me!  Location, location, location.  Easily access Stowe, Burlington and the Mad River Valley as well as all of Waterbury's great destinations like Ben and Jerry's, Cider Mill, and our great food scene.  The Apartment is tastefully decorated with really nice furniture, a full Kitchen with all the basics and cool decorations including an old Pinball Machine and Jukebox (sadly both our currently out of order).  There is another two bedroom apartment upstairs and the whole place can be combined into a 5 bedroom apartment.DISCLAIMER: The apartment - especially one of the bedrooms shares a wall with the restaurant so when there is live music it can be very loud.  Most of our shows are Thurs, Fri or Saturday and often over by midnight but shows can go later.  I provide ear plugs and no guarantees beyond that.  I have had hundreds of people stay in the apartment over the past couple years (I have it listed as a five bedroom space utilizing both floors as well) and only a few have complained about the noise.  So I'll leave it up to you to decide if you can live with it or not :)",Mountain view**__**Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**TV,Entire rental unit hosted by Ari,"['Scenic views\nMountain view', 'Bathroom\nHair dryer\nShampoo\nHot water', 'Bedroom and laundry\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nIron', 'Entertainment\nTV', 'Heating and cooling\nHeating', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nFire extinguisher', 'Internet and office\nWifi', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nCooking basics\nPots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nFreezer\nDishwasher\nStove\nOven\nHot water kettle\nCoffee maker\nWine glasses\nToaster\nBlender\nDining table', 'Location features\nPrivate entrance\nSeparate street or building entrance', 'Outdoor\nShared patio or balcony\nShared backyard – Not fully fenced\nAn open space on the property usually covered in grass\nBBQ grill', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises\nFree street parking', 'Services\nSelf check-in\nKeypad\nCheck yourself into the home with a door code', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Washer\nWasher\nUnavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning']","['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-11190144/original/5045cab7-5073-4c4d-a741-b2ca26c9fc1b.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-11190144/original/613811d1-48d8-4f7e-b548-2f50786b412c.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-11190144/original/8f59dc5f-a150-4da0-a833-3906bedb018e.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-11190144/original/9d233fb7-71c7-432c-811e-ef2524343873.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-11190144/original/b4af01cd-6055-4cb2-a60b-6951e18daef8.jpeg']","Hosted by Ari

You can't get more centrally located to everything Vermont has to offer.  5 minutes to downtown Waterbury, 10 minutes to Stowe, Half an hour to Burlington or Mad River.  There is a shared hallway entry with the downstairs apartment but only the one exterior door in common.The spaceDISCLAIMER:  At the risk of sounding rude please remember I don't need you to book this place.  I've been doing airbnb for almost a decade.  Ive found cool laid back travelers with a sense of adventure absolutely love my place and this accounts for 95% of my guests.  My life has become increasingly busy(2 business', two toddlers, multiple airbnbs) and help increasingly hard to find and my tolerance for nit picky guests who are gonna freak out over a stray hair, a tattered corner on a sheet or some other minor inconvenience is pretty much gone.   If you have an issue when you arrive by all means let me know and I will bend over backwards to resolve it but I'd love to find a way to get rid of the needy/whiney guest who ends up stressing me out and making me wish I didn't do Airbnb.  Remember this whole thing started with a guy renting out his couch in San Francisco for a few extra bucks.  If you love walking in to a hotel room and getting exactly what you expect I reccomend staying at one of the many awesome local hotels that would love your business.  If your just looking for a dope pad to crash and experience our cool little town come drink some beers and catch an awesome show or two  then please book with  me!  This iconic barn was once a working Dairy barn that was converted into a wooden toy factory in the 60's. It then became an iconic ski restaurant in the 70's and operated with acclaim for 40 years. I purchased and started renovating the space in 2015. Everyone is blown away by how spacious this place is. 2 Huge bedrooms with high quality queen size beds. Each room feature sky lights and all have spacious closets. There is a large living room  with a apt size fridge, 20” range and stainless counter and sink for preparing meals.  There is  flat screen TV for streaming your favorite shows. The small balcony has great views of sunrise and the Worcester  mountains.  We have a restaurant and yoga/wellness studio under the apartment and you get a discount to both if you mention you are an Airbnb guest. Noise can be an issue but ear plugs are an easy solution if music bothers you at night and we work hard to accommodate everyone to ensure a wonderful stay and during covid we have nothing planned besides occasional solo artists. The property is adjacent to one of the top golf courses in the state and you can walk along the community path to down town Waterbury. Takes about 25 minutes. I keep a few nice mowed trails on my property which is part of an important wild life corridor. You can explore the beautiful thatcher brook and may even be able to pull out a fish or two. In the winter you can put on your xc skis and head right out the door.",Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**TV**__**Bathtub,Entire rental unit hosted by Ari,"['Bathroom\nBathtub\nHair dryer\nCleaning products\nShampoo\nConditioner\nBody soap\nHot water', 'Bedroom and laundry\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nIron\nClothing storage: closet', 'Entertainment\nTV', 'Heating and cooling\nCeiling fan\nPortable fans\nHeating', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nFire extinguisher\nFirst aid kit', 'Internet and office\nWifi', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nCooking basics\nPots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nMini fridge\nFreezer\nGas stove\nOven\nCoffee maker\nWine glasses\nDining table', 'Location features\nPrivate entrance\nSeparate street or building entrance\nLaundromat nearby', 'Outdoor\nShared patio or balcony\nShared backyard – Not fully fenced\nAn open space on the property usually covered in grass\nBBQ grill', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises', 'Services\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more\nSelf check-in\nKeypad\nCheck yourself into the home with a door code\nCleaning available during stay', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Washer\nWasher\nUnavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning']","['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-11191103/original/3bb31e37-395b-4b9a-8d16-ae0aa1bc8270.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-11191103/original/0c008ff4-c2e8-40dd-85ab-881d9b1658a3.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-11191103/original/9df94a6a-5023-4524-91be-b9cd6f84fcce.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-11191103/original/72c887a4-982d-4f9d-b724-4cc80ec98c0a.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-11191103/original/6c4a2d5f-de26-44dd-beb1-23e01314f6de.jpeg']","Hosted by Ari

This is our primary residence, and being empty-nesters, we stay in a self-contained apartment attached to the home when we have guests (unless we are travelling ourselves).  The apartment and the main home are separate so our paths will not typically cross.

The stairs to the second floor are steeper (and maybe a little creakier) than usual and take you to the landing which all bedrooms are accessed from. The rustic floorboards lead you to either a Queen room (x2) or the Master with a King bed and walk in closet. There is a brand new full bath off the landing. The backyard offers a stone patio to enjoy summer meals under the stars. There is a 'stream' that runs through the property which adds peaceful background noise in addition to the many other sounds of nature you'll find here. The home backs up to 100's of acres of protected land further supporting the  remote feel of the cottage.During snow/mud season in Vermont we recommend AWD or 4WD.",Mountain view**__**Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**HDTV with Roku,Entire cottage hosted by Tom,[],"['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-54314928/original/854b128d-6afb-411b-b3ea-bc67abc978f0.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-54314928/original/d037e9b6-49b4-425c-bf2c-8fc43958342e.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-54314928/original/04178c4e-8b8b-4b1e-860f-124f570da367.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-54314928/original/265c72f4-856b-45e9-9ef5-0857ef981145.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-54314928/original/fe8fc4d5-4af7-446a-9fa4-ededd675d3b9.jpeg']","Hosted by Tom

Private, with Stunning views this was built by ""The Tree House Guys"" a local Vermont company whom can be found having a season on the DIY network.  Tons of detail, while keeping the design natural and simple.  Unbelievable views of Camels hump State park. A loft with one queen bed and downstairs has a queen bed with three sides of the bed having windows facing the views.  Hiking offered right from the cabin. An awesome getaway!The spaceLilla Rustica cabin in the trees has a beautiful nestled in feel with incredible views from all windows.  One of the highlights is the downstairs queen bed.  Surrounded on three sides by windows you can look at the stars while lying in bed, or perhaps hear deer walk under the cabin while sleeping.  Feel far from it all while still close to route 100 in Vermont which has Ben and Jerry's, Prohibition Pig, Stowe, Sugar Bush and the Mad River Valley, Lawsons and The Alchemist breweries, Lot of swimming holes and tons of hiking and mountain biking.Internet is provided as well as a small refrigerator, and luxurious sheets and pillows.  Stay warm and cozy inside the treehouse with a propane fireplace.Water is limited up in the trees, but you will be provided with all you need of some of the best Spring water you may have ever tasted.  There is not a shower at this point in Lilla Rustica.  We hope in the future build an outdoor shower, but for longer stays there are swimming holes, gyms and spas close by.  The toilet for the cabin is located just at the end of ramp from the front door.  About a 5 second walk.  It is private for those staying in Lilla Rustica.  It is a porta pottty built to look like an outhouse.  The advantage to this is that is rarely used and only by those guests of the cabin as well as fully cleaned and emptied very often.  Having a toilet up in the trees is difficult.  We know how important a clean bathroom is to guests and we think you will be pleasantly surprised with the experience.  Beautiful cups and dishes are provided, dish towels, sheets, water, a way to make coffee and a small single burner gas stove.  This cabin is super cozy and perhaps best for a couple.  However, groups of four out having adventures during the day will love to come back to the cabin and enjoy its cozy feel in the evening.

Close to I-5 and Hwy 99, within 20 minutes you could be in downtown Seattle, hiking a forest trail, or taking a ferry ride across the Puget Sound. Ferry Ride Room is your beautiful, private room with private bath, mini-fridge, Keurig, iron/board, wi-fi, queen-size bed, and a repurposed 1920's armoire to die for. An incredible value compared to listings in downtown.The spacePassage House is our family home that we love sharing. Our main goal is for you to feel at home in this space by being, not a place to escape real life, but a place to feel peaceful and safe in the midst of real life. This means you'll experience the ambiance of the Ferry Ride Room, representing a peaceful passage across the Sound on a foggy morning, but you'll also hear the bumping and giggling (and sometimes crying) of our four kids throughout the house. The shared entrance leads straight into the hallway with your private room & bath. Everything is ready to make you feel welcome and at home.The space includes (but is not limited to):+ queen bed+ private bathroom with bath/shower that'll make you want to bring pink tubs back!+ mini-fridge+keurig+plates, cups, cutlery, paper towels, etc.+ wood floors + ecologically friendly all LED lighting+ highspeed wifi+closet with hangers, iron & ironing board+central heating (though the control panel is in a different area of the house so you won't have access to temperature control)+portable fan/heaterNote: Your safety and security is my concern. To this end, there are smoke & carbon monoxide detectors, fire extinguishers, and a first aid kit.Note: Your room is next to the only stairwell up to our part of the house. We try to not use this very often, however, you will occasionally see us heading up to the upstairs of the house. If you're new to Seattle, I'm happy to assist you in planning and getting around. Once rented, I have a strict policy of not entering your space unless there is an absolute and critical emergency.The nearest shopping plaza a mile away has all your needs, including: supermarket, Trader Joes, Starbucks, Orange Theory gym, drugstore, post office, a few restaurants (including pizza and frozen yogurt), etc. There are several parks within a short walking distance.We do not have a driveway to park in, however there is always plenty of free street parking (enough that you won't have to parallel park if you don't want to :)",Fast wifi – 535 Mbps**__**Free street parking**__**Bathtub**__**Luggage dropoff allowed**__**Hair dryer,Private room in home hosted by Laura,"['Bathroom\nBathtub\nHair dryer\nShampoo\nConditioner\nBody soap\nHot water', 'Bedroom and laundry\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nIron\nClothing storage: closet', 'Entertainment\nBooks and reading material', 'Heating and cooling\nPortable fans\nCentral heating\nPortable heater', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nFire extinguisher\nLock on bedroom door\nPrivate room can be locked for safety and privacy\nFirst aid kit', 'Internet and office\nFast wifi – 535 Mbps\nVerified by speed test.

I'm a Seattle native and, yes, I love this city to bits. I read a ton, and wish I could finish more novels than I do. I enjoy live music, theater and ballet. And I'm a fan of modern board games. I'm more a city guy than an outdoors dude.

While it is clean and fully furnished, there is general wear and tear in the apartment. I rent out my space when I am out of town for work, so I lock the bedroom closet but provide a clothes rail with storage and hangers for guests.

You'll love my place because of the central location, free parking, delicious local restaurants, and easy commute to anywhere in the city. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travel, and families with kids. This is a new listing for the same unit I've been hosting for 4 years. Please click on my name and read all my reviews for this space!The spaceHello travelers! Welcome to our home in the city. This is a 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom space with an attic loft. There is a queen bed in the bedroom, and two twin beds in the loft. This is a second floor unit located on Western Ave., so there is some noise from the street. It does quiet down at night and the bedroom is towards the rear of the apartment so if you're looking for a city apartment that's minutes from it all, this is the one!There is free street parking on Western Ave. The Blue Line Western stop is just a few blocks south. This is the train that runs from O'hare Airport all the way downtown. If you're driving, the Kennedy Expressway 94 is just 2 blocks north, off the Fullerton exit.There is a secure lock box with 2 keys for easy check-in. We have exterior security cameras for additional security. This also means we can see how many people come in and out of the apartment so please be honest when making your booking as any unapproved guests will be charged the additional guest fee. Any unapproved parties or gatherings will be charged the full security deposit. My husband and I designed and built this unit.

No need for a pool - literally step right outside take a dip in warm ocean or sunbathe on the beach in front of the cottage.  Need a beverage? Just 10 steps back into the house and roll a cooler to the beach out front. The property grounds are grassy and expansive with over 270’ft of ocean frontage, one of the largest ocean frontages in Haena / Hanalei.

Warning: You may see turtles and humpback whales swimming by and/or oversized rainbows forming over the ocean while you’re on your zoom calls which may cause co-worker envy.  Located in the idyllic town of Haena, the home is just a 5 minute walk to our local restaurant (Opakapaka Bar and Grill) and coffee shop or a quick drive to Hanalei town for ample delicious restaurant options, grocery stores and shopping.  Tunnels beach is a quick bike ride or drive with some of Kauai’s best snorkeling and highest chance of swimming with our local resident Sea Turtles ‘Honus’. Haena is also home to a few celebrities (Pierce Brosnan (007), Anthony Kiedis, etc.) drawn in by the serenity and beauty of this north shore surf town. Another mile down the road you will enter Haena State Park and Ke’e Beach and the start of the Na Pali trail, Kauai’s most epic hiking trail.

Outside is a private shower with a spectacular view of the jungle, private deck, barbecue, tiki torches to enjoy the evening, and all the style of old Hawaii. Located just 100 steps to one of Kauai's most secluded North Shore beaches! If you are seeking a Honeymoon hideaway or romantic getaway, look no further :)The spaceIpo Cottage is the manifestation of our dream of living nestled in between the lush, verdant Kauai jungle and the beautiful turquoise ocean.  Experience the incredible beauty of the north shore from our beach cottage just 100 steps to the tropical Pacific Ocean.  Directly behind the cottage is a lush jungle hillside that borders thousands of acres of private nature conservancy land tucked into a secluded, kamani tree lined cul-de-sac.  The sun rises directly in front of the cottage over the ocean and you can walk down the private drive to put your toes in the sand or snorkel right in front of the house on a calm summer day at Kepuhi point with one of the most beautiful coves on the North shore just in front of the cottage to the right (east).  The North Shore of Kauai feels like “heaven on earth”  attracting a consciousness and reverence for the awe-inspiring nature, combining raw stunning beauty in a mesmerizing array of impossible mountain scapes, endless beaches, lush tropical jungles, adventure opportunities, beach charm and a laid back surfer-vibe beach charm. Haena beaches offer some of Hawaii's best surfing, shelling, sunning, and snorkeling. The home is a just under 3 miles (5 min drive) to Ke’e Beach and the entrance of the legendary Kalalau trail which runs along the picturesque Na Pali Coast. A quick 10 minute drive to Hanalei town will bring you to a variety of restaurants and charming boutiques. Here you will also find Hanalei Bay, a two-mile white sand crescent beach, which is ideal for surfing, stand up paddle boarding, kayaking, fishing, and good old fashioned swimming. Princeville is just up the road and provides activities such as golf, zip-lining, and horseback riding.  Or just take the beach chairs and walk the steps to the beach out front.  Beach gear is provided including beach chairs, cooler, umbrella, boogie boards. As the owners are in health and wellness there is a  concerted effort to add healing touches such as a Biomat and diffusers for essential oils to the home to make it nourishing as well as comfortable.  We use all natural products and reduce our impact on the environment as we strive to offer an eco-friendly home, featuring efficient appliances, lighting, recycling.  Our tap water is supplied from the local purified rainwater so there is no need to bring bottled water.  Please be sure to use Reef-safe sunblock during your stay in Kauai as well. We hope you love Kauai as much as we do and will make an effort to join us in these simple measures to protect this beautiful land. Located in the idyllic town of Haena, the home is just a 5 minute walk to our local restaurant (Opakapaka Bar and Grill) and coffee shop or a quick drive to Hanalei town for ample delicious restaurant options, grocery stores and shopping.  Tunnels beach is a quick bike ride or drive with some of Kauai’s best snorkeling and highest chance of swimming with our local resident Sea Turtles ‘Honus’. Please note - you are visiting the tropics and anywhere you stay in Hawaii you will likely see more insects than you do on the mainland. They are part of the eco-system and thankfully none are harmful.

It is located right next to the parking lot.  Most units at Hanalei Bay Resort require a use of a personal shuttle bus to reach their destination.SPECIAL Note:  (1) Does Kauai Have A Night Scene? Not really ... If you are looking for nightlife, you should probably stay in Honolulu.(2) Not suitable for guests that need extreme quietness.  When lanai doors are open, noise may be heard from guest shuttle service, resort vendor ect…(Closing lanai doors will remedy this concern).(3) Correction: NO snorkeling gear/beach blanket provided but instead 2 boogie boards, igloo, beach umbrella, 2 beach chairs and 2 rain umbrellas are provided under beach amenities.(4) Bathroom is design as a wet shower area which allows for the floors to get wet outside the shower area.

You will be mesmerized by the impossibly turquoise waters, dramatic cloud formations and never ending horizons!The spaceWe welcome you with sincere Aloha to our home on Kauai, Hale Kamapua'a ( kah-mah-poo-AH-ah). Named for the Hawaiian pig-god known for his awesome power and magical ability to appear in different forms, he was transformed by love and is known as the protector of the verdant forests of Hawaii. The North Shore of Kauai is one of the most special and beautiful places on Earth. Our goal is to offer a home that is as Green and Eco friendly as possible. To that end we respectfully ask that you not bring single use plastic water bottles into our home. We provide ample stainless steel, reusable water bottles for your use while staying at Hale Kamapua'a. Luckily, Kauai is blessed with excellent drinking water directly from the tap. Reef-safe sunblock is the law in Hawaii. Please don't bring sunblock purchased on the mainland unless you are certain it is rated as ""reef-safe"". We provide a large can of quality reef-safe sunblock to get you started. All appliances, the air conditioning system, and water heater are recently purchased and chosen for their energy efficiency. In an effort to reduce the packaging waste in our home, we provide bulk purchased compostable trash bags, ample supplies of detergent, laundry soap, paper towels and toilet tissue.  Each of the three bathrooms is also supplied with large bottles of shampoo and large bars of soap. We ask you to join us in our efforts by separating recyclables, cleaning them and placing them in the blue bins provided. We have contracted to have the recycling picked up weekly. We hope you love Kauai as much as we do and will make the effort to join us in these simple measures to protect her.The house includes a master bedroom upstairs with king sized bed, bathroom, large flat screened TV, walk-in closet and ample comfortable seating. There is also a private lanai with a corner view of the ocean and full view of the jungle cascading down the cliff face in the back with seating that includes an outdoor easy chair, the perfect place to sit back and watch the formations of tropical birds flying overhead or to enjoy a passing tropical rain shower.There is also a loft upstairs with a magnificent ocean view, a sitting area and a daybed(punei). It's the perfect place to enjoy a good book or an afternoon nap. There are two bedrooms downstairs, both with queen sized beds, bathrooms, closets and flat screened TVs. One bedroomis nestled in the back of the house and offers a private, quiet solitude and is the favorite room of one of the owners: AKA ""The Man-Cave"". The other bedroom is on the side of the house with views of the ocean and sliding glass door that opens on to the wrap around lanai.All three bedrooms feature recently purchased quality mattresses. The bedding and linens and towels are all better quality, including an ample supply of extra large beach towels.The owners are retired from the San Francisco restaurant scene, a fact which is reflected in the generously appointed kitchen. Ample quality dinnerware, utensils and cookware are provided. All appliances are new or recently purchased. There is a new gas BBQ grill on the lanai.After a day at the beach, there are two convenient foot washing stations with hoses at the base of each of the two staircases leading up to the lanai to help keep sand off your feet and out of the house. There is also a luxurious, warm water, private outdoor shower.The house is fully air conditioned with separate wall units serving each bedroom and the downstairs living room. Each room has its own remote control and individual rooms may be closed off and air conditioned or left open to the breezes and sound of the ocean with the AC turned off.",Beach access – Beachfront**__**Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**TV with standard cable,Entire home hosted by Paul,"['Bathroom\nBathtub\nHair dryer\nShampoo\nHot water', 'Bedroom and laundry\nWasher\nDryer\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nExtra pillows and blankets\nIron', 'Entertainment\nTV with standard cable', 'Heating and cooling\nAir conditioning', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nFire extinguisher\nFirst aid kit', 'Internet and office\nWifi', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nCoffee maker', 'Location features\nBeach access – Beachfront\nGuests can enjoy a nearby beach\nPrivate entrance\nSeparate street or building entrance', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises', 'Services\nSelf check-in\nLockbox\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Heating\nHeating']","['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/83ed1fd7-f670-4c1a-ab5a-1e05b27e9bbe.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/9f3e63f5-ba68-453c-918d-0df39248e779.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/5db6e2dc-a2d8-47de-8c76-89b5133062a9.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/2f5bf91d-397f-4be1-987f-a8e8d8d29a07.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/e1fd1d5b-4b53-43c3-8c24-ade11f37d877.jpg']","Hosted by Paul

Includes full kitchen, washer/dryer, cable tv with DVD player, free wifi. Two full bathrooms, both with tub and shower, one upstairs and one downstairs.  Since this is an upstairs condo, there is nobody above you!Our Kauai vacation rentals at Sealodge Kauai are located at the end of a small quiet side road, with no through traffic, that ends at a dramatic ocean bluff.  These Princeville condos face the ocean on their lanai side.  A short hike brings you to the secluded Sealodge Beach. The jungle trail crosses a small stream then descends to a secluded sandy cove.  The ocean at Sealodge Beach is shallow and protected by a reef, making it ideal for snorkeling and swimming.The Sealodge condos were built so you can see the rolling white water waves from the living room windows, the bedroom windows, and the lanai.  From all three of these locations you can hear the surf, watch for whales, spinner dolphins, and exotic birds. There is a pool and BBQ area (grills are charcoal and you must bring your own briquettes). Sealodge is comfortable, quiet, island casual, and ocean-breeze cooled (no AC).Update 11/9/22 (*Please note that the Sealodge swimming pool is undergoing repairs and is expected to be out of service until March 2023*) As with most homes on Kauai, this vacation rental is NOT air conditioned.It is very difficult to get around Kauai without a rental car. Rental cars may be in limited supply, please book your transportation needs early.Although this home has internet, the speed and reliability cannot be guaranteed due to the remote location and the service being provided by a third-party.

Your vacation home is set up with years of experience in guest hosting. As mentioned in all of my reviews, the space is extremely clean, and fully equipped so you’ll enjoy returning home after a day of adventure. Cook home made meals in a full kitchen stocked with everything you'd expect at your own home. Use your own washer/dryer, sleep in a new memory foam king bed with 6 pillows, high thread count sheets and cotton Tommy Bahama bedding. Sip your morning coffee on a private lanai with a glimpse of the Mamalahoa Mountain Range peaks and surrounding jungle before taking a stroll on the 2 mile path just outside your front door. The sunset view from an ocean front cliff is spectacular, and just a couple of minutes walk down the path.Hale Moi is a condominium complex of both residents and vacationers. *Quiet hours at Hale Moi are observed from 9pm to 8am.Your unit is in the 1st building of the complex on ground level, with a common wall on one side and golf course acreage on the other which provides a unique private setting. However, you may still hear sounds of nearby neighbors or from the road, or even from wild chickens during the day. They are most active in the morning so if you are a late sleeper, I recommend ear plugs. This is the case anywhere you stay on Kauai.*Your unit has designated parking very close to front door! *BBQ (complex shared picnic area) is conveniently located in the middle of property grounds. No BBQ equipment permitted at your unit. No open fires permitted anywhere on property. *Complimentary guest starter supplies provided in unit: Coffee and filter, paper towels, new dish sponge, dish soap and dishwasher detergent, laundry detergent, garbage bags, shampoo/conditioner, body soap, hand soap, and 2 toilet paper rolls. In addition: 2 bath towel sets (body/hand/face) per guest and 2 beach towels, (1 per guest). For your convenience,  we also provide a cooler, a beach umbrella and beach chairs. We do not provide snorkel gear due to Covid. Please note that we do not have AC. It really helps that this is a downstairs unit, so the space is a lot cooler than the other units on property. There are ceiling fans in every room, plus area fans to help cool you down. With the windows open, the Tradewinds are enough to circulate air inside your condo. *Note: We also have another unit right next door if you have more than 2 in your party and want to stay close-by each other.

However, you may still hear sounds of nearby neighbors or from the road, or even from wild chickens during the day. They are most active in the morning so if you are a late sleeper, I recommend ear plugs. This is the case anywhere you stay on Kauai.*Your unit has designated parking very close to front door! *BBQ (complex shared picnic area) is conveniently located in the middle of property grounds. No BBQ equipment permitted at your unit. No open fires permitted anywhere on property. *Complimentary guest starter supplies provided in unit: Coffee and filter, paper towels, new dish sponge, dish soap and dishwasher detergent, laundry detergent, garbage bags, shampoo/conditioner, body soap, hand soap, and 2 toilet paper rolls. In addition: 2 bath towel sets (body/hand/face) per guest and 2 beach towels, (1 per guest). For your convenience,  we also provide a cooler, a beach umbrella and beach chairs. We do not provide snorkel gear due to Covid. Please note that we do not have AC. It really helps that this is a downstairs unit, so the space is a lot cooler than the other units on property. There are ceiling fans in every room, plus area fans to help cool you down.

Please note I cannot accept early check-in or late checkout requests at this time for the safety and health of our cleaning crew and guests. The studio has a kitchenette (small fridge & freezer, single burner with frying pan and saucepan, toaster, coffee maker). I also supply the unit with utensils to use at the BBQ at the pool area. Has large TV with DVD player. I also provide shampoo, conditioner, and body wash for the shower. Comes also with linens, towels, and hair dryer. THERE IS NO A/C in the unit and it can warm up during the summer months, but usually cools down in the night.There are no laundry facilities in the complex. Closest laundromat - Laundromat Express - is located in Kapaa which is 35 min away.I follow Airbnb’s enhanced cleaning protocol, which was developed with expert guidance. Here are a few highlights:I sanitize high-touch surfaces, down to the doorknobI use cleaners and disinfectants approved by global health agencies, and I wear protective gear to help prevent cross-contaminationI clean each room using extensive cleaning checklistsI provide extra cleaning supplies, so you can clean as you stayI comply with local laws, including any additional safety or cleaning guidelines",Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**Shared pool**__**Shared hot tub,Entire rental unit hosted by Juliana,"['Bathroom\nHair dryer\nCleaning products\nShampoo\nConditioner\nBody soap\nHot water', 'Bedroom and laundry\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nIron\nDrying rack for clothing', 'Entertainment\nTV with Amazon Prime Video, Netflix', 'Heating and cooling\nCeiling fan\nPortable fans', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm', 'Internet and office\nWifi', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nCooking basics\nPots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nMini fridge\nFreezer\nStove\nCoffee maker: Keurig coffee machine\nToaster\nDining table', 'Location features\nPrivate entrance\nSeparate street or building entrance', 'Outdoor\nPrivate patio or balcony\nShared backyard – Not fully fenced\nAn open space on the property usually covered in grass\nOutdoor furniture\nBBQ grill\nBeach essentials\nBeach towels, umbrella, beach blanket, snorkeling gear', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises\nShared pool\nShared hot tub', 'Services\nSelf check-in\nKeypad\nCheck yourself into the home with a door code', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property\nUnavailable: Washer\nWasher\nUnavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning\nUnavailable: Heating\nHeating']","['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/3a0acd45-d05a-41a7-952e-67c0f188297f.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/d28af5bc-26d2-44a4-b86f-5b9d8e9afd30.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/2881fe01-3b44-4c69-92e6-9a2358329010.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/1a01326d-88dc-48a4-a15c-af83a4a0a728.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/8a7909d6-48d0-4a16-b12f-a0374b288e7f.jpg']","Hosted by Juliana

These Hanalei vacation rentals are directly on the beach...no path to follow, just take a few steps and you're on the sand.  And I1 is the closest building, directly on the beach.  You can also take advantage of the restaurant and spa onsite, or prepare your own food in your apartment's full kitchen or on the gas grills provided.  Pool, jacuzzi and barbecue are conveniently close.This condo has a large shady lanai that puts you 10 steps from the sand.  There are two bedrooms, one with a king bed and the other with two twin beds.  For privacy, the bedrooms can be closed off from the rest of the unit with sliding shoji screens, which still allow air flow to keep you cool at night.  The living and dining areas are comfortably furnished and there are spectacular beach views from the large picture windows.  There's a full bath and a half bath.  While there are no televisions or cable television service in the complex, wifi is provided so you won't be completely cut off from the modern world.  (Only as cut off as you want to be.)In addition to Hanalei Colony Resort I1's beautiful interior and views, and the beach just in front,  guests can enjoy the swimming pool, jacuzzi, barbecue grills, and guest laundry room.  You can walk next door to the Opakapaka Bar and Grill. Also located just across the parking lot is the Hanalei Day Spa. Just ten minutes past the charming town of Hanalei, you'll find that shopping and dining options are conveniently close.  It's the perfect Kauai vacation rental for proposals, honeymoons, anniversaries, and other romantic occasions.As with most homes on Kauai, this vacation rental is NOT air conditioned.It is very difficult to get around Kauai without a rental car.

Casual tropical interior includes perfect work-from-home space gazing directly out at the beach!The spaceOur Haena vacation rentals at the Hanalei Colony Resort are mere steps from the beach.  These highly desirable north shore Kauai rentals offer spectacular and unspoiled ocean scenery with incredible whitewater views from your private lanai.  Hanalei Colony Resort J3 takes full advantage of the trade winds, and the large shady lanai also helps keep it cool inside.  If the trade winds die down, multiple high-speed fans provide plenty of breeze as well.  And because this unit has a convenient desk area (facing one of the picture windows with its spectacular oceanfront views), it is also perfect for those who need to mix a little work with their wave-watching!  If you want to get out and enjoy a walk along the beach, you can walk all the way along the beach for literally hours before reaching the “end of the road” at Kee Beach – a walk that will take you past world-famous Tunnels Beach as well. Hanalei Colony Resort is perfect for a romantic couple's getaway...but there's also plenty of room for you to bring the kids.  The master bedroom is furnished with a king bed, and can be closed off from the living area with sliding shoji-style doors.  The shoji doors' slatted construction provide visual privacy while still allowing air flow so you'll sleep cool at night.  The second bedroom has a full size sleeper sofa and a twin day bed.  If you're not using it as sleeping space, it makes a perfect office, or comfy additional hang-out space.  The second bedroom also can be closed off from the living area with sliding louver doors.  You'll find a comfortably furnished living room, with another sleeper sofa, and a dining area that can seat 5 people.  The full kitchen is equipped with everything you need to prepare simple meals at home...which you can enjoy on the lanai while listening to the sound of the waves!  Enjoy the resort amenities including swimming pool, jacuzzi, barbecue grills, and guest laundry room.  Please note that as a guest in a privately managed unit, you won't be able to ride the resort shuttle.As with most homes on Kauai, this vacation rental is NOT air conditioned.It is very difficult to get around Kauai without a rental car.

Relax on the punee (that’s a window seat in the living room  - twin bed size, so a great place for a child to sleep) and enjoy the cooling breeze as you listen to the sounds of the surf and admire the sight of a sunrise over the ocean.  The bedroom is furnished with a queen bed.  There is an accordion door that slides shut to provide privacy in the bedroom.  Smart television and free wifi are included.  Full kitchen.  Coin operated washer and dryer in the next building.      Our Kauai vacation rentals at Sealodge are located at the end of a small quiet side road, with no through traffic, that ends at a dramatic ocean bluff.  These Princeville condos face the ocean on their lanai side.  A short hike brings you to the secluded Sealodge Beach. The jungle trail crosses a small stream then descends to a secluded sandy cove.  The ocean at Sealodge Beach is shallow and protected by a reef, making it ideal for snorkeling and swimming. The Sealodge condos were built so you can see the rolling white water waves from the living room windows, the bedroom windows, and the lanai.  From all three of these locations you can hear the surf, watch for whales, spinner dolphins, and exotic birds. There is a pool and BBQ area (grills are charcoal and you must bring your own briquettes). Sealodge is comfortable, quiet, and island casual, a more private and secluded alternative to Kauai hotels. Update 11/9/22 (*Please note that the Sealodge swimming pool is undergoing repairs and is expected to be out of service until March 2023*) As with most homes on Kauai, this vacation rental is NOT air conditioned.It is very difficult to get around Kauai without a rental car.

Compact but well-designed & charming. Comfy pillowtop queen mattress, luxurious bamboo sheets, 32"" HDTV, small fridge, Keurig coffee maker, tea kettle, microwave, ample beach gear, dresser, a safe, and fast internet. Perfectly located in a quiet complex minutes to the shops at Princeville Ctr, quaint Hanalei town, Queen's Bath, many lovely beaches and hiking.The spaceIki helu'ai means ""little gem"" in Hawaiian and I think the guest's area is exactly that. The bedroom itself is a pretty compact space--12.5 feet x 11 feet or 140 square feet--but I think my guests find it charming, well designed and comfortable. Our condo complex is in an excellent location in the lovely and safe community of Princeville.. It is well away from the main road (Ka Haku) so it's very peaceful and quiet and full of beautiful mature trees and plants. You mostly only hear birds singing (unless it's grounds maintenance day but even then it's only a few minutes of noise!). And the newly retiled complex pool and complimentary parking are just steps away. My unit is located on the 12th hole of the gorgeous Makai golf course as well and guests can enjoy strolling out on the paths in the mornings before golf is played or evenings when it's done to enjoy the incredible ocean views and  bird life, even a nesting albatross for part of the year (Nov-June)..Humpback whales can also be observed between Dec-April...The guest's space can be entered/exited via the lanai without disturbing us in the main part of the residence. The guest's hallway, bedroom and bath are on the ground level within our home but both drapes and sliding wood, barn-style door clearly defines and separates the space from the rest of the home and provides ample privacy. Additionally, the bedroom itself has its own internal locking door as well, so I believe my goal of providing guests with comfort and privacy has been achieved. The bedroom and patio are east facing--it's a lovely spot to have your morning coffee-- is shaded by a pretty tree and does not bake in the afternoon sun--or evening cocktail ! I look forward to welcoming my guests to magnificent Kauai and always do my utmost to ensure a wonderful stay!Note: The nightly rate includes taxes so it's a great value!",Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**Pool**__**TV**__**Private patio or balcony**__**Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarmCarbon monoxide alarm,Private room in condo hosted by Andie,[],"['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-21764477/original/4962c046-d92b-428c-97c0-3c47337bb140.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-21764477/original/58c1bc9c-4b69-4a85-8ffe-740e47c78e57.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-21764477/original/ee642f73-c6a3-4483-bf0e-7eb406b9260a.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-21764477/original/d818d25b-e82a-4237-867f-872a3a521976.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-21764477/original/7c6c00d9-c5ec-4679-8f8d-a7768ca43719.jpeg']","Hosted by Andie

This condo is the perfect romantic getaway for a couple on a budget. Includes cable TV and wifi.The spaceSealodge E8: This affordable one bedroom Sealodge Kauai condo offers an amazing oceanfront view.  Relax on the punee (that’s a window seat in the living room  - twin bed size, so a great place for a child to sleep) and enjoy the cooling breeze as you listen to the sounds of the surf and admire the sight of a sunrise over the ocean.  The bedroom is furnished with a queen bed.  There is an accordion door that slides shut to provide privacy in the bedroom.  Smart television and free wifi are included.  Full kitchen.  Coin operated washer and dryer in the next building.      Our Kauai vacation rentals at Sealodge are located at the end of a small quiet side road, with no through traffic, that ends at a dramatic ocean bluff.  These Princeville condos face the ocean on their lanai side.  A short hike brings you to the secluded Sealodge Beach. The jungle trail crosses a small stream then descends to a secluded sandy cove.  The ocean at Sealodge Beach is shallow and protected by a reef, making it ideal for snorkeling and swimming. The Sealodge condos were built so you can see the rolling white water waves from the living room windows, the bedroom windows, and the lanai.  From all three of these locations you can hear the surf, watch for whales, spinner dolphins, and exotic birds. There is a pool and BBQ area (grills are charcoal and you must bring your own briquettes). Sealodge is comfortable, quiet, and island casual, a more private and secluded alternative to Kauai hotels. Update 11/9/22 (*Please note that the Sealodge swimming pool is undergoing repairs and is expected to be out of service until March 2023*) As with most homes on Kauai, this vacation rental is NOT air conditioned.It is very difficult to get around Kauai without a rental car. Rental cars may be in limited supply, please book your transportation needs early.Although this home has internet, the speed and reliability cannot be guaranteed due to the remote location and the service being provided by a third-party.Hawaii Vacation Rental Registration Number TA-013-019-1360-01",Ocean view**__**Sea view**__**Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarmCarbon monoxide alarm,Entire condo hosted by Kauai Kahuna,"['Scenic views\nOcean view\nSea view', 'Bathroom\nHair dryer\nHot water', 'Bedroom and laundry\nWasher\nDryer\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers', 'Entertainment\nTV', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm', 'Internet and office\nWifi', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nCooking basics\nPots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nCoffee maker', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises\nPool', 'Services\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more\nSelf check-in\nLockbox', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning\nUnavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nThere is no carbon monoxide detector on the property.\nUnavailable: Shampoo\nShampoo\nUnavailable: Private entrance\nPrivate entrance\nUnavailable: Heating\nHeating']","['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/0dfb4916-8449-4a80-9d11-b4344cfc0013.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/c6070190-9a39-4621-9327-55cb67b5c630.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/d5a47f65-28d8-475d-9f5c-b408f077b293.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/ff1cab81-453f-4269-ab3c-0a79aecbfc5d.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/e2f7b61b-7b74-40bc-818b-4c1144a7e1de.jpg']","Hosted by Kauai Kahuna

There's a punae in the living room (basically a Hawaiian daybed built into the window alcove) which is a perfect spot to relax and read while enjoying the view and the cool ocean breeze.  Bedding is provided, so if you're traveling with a child, they'll have their own sleeping space.

Private, romantic, yet just 15 minutes from shopping and dining in Hanalei.The spaceHanalei Colony Resort I2 is unique among north shore Kauai condo resorts.  These Hanalei vacation rentals are directly on the beach...no path to follow, just take a few steps and you're on the sand.  And I2 is literally just a few steps to the beach, with absolutely amazing sea views from every room.  The only way you could be any closer to the water is if you were actually on a boat!  You can also take advantage of the restaurant and spa onsite, or prepare your own food in your apartment's full kitchen or on the gas grills provided.  Pool, jacuzzi, guest laundry room, and barbecue are conveniently close.Hanalei Colony Resort I2 is completely updated inside with a prime oceanfront location at north shore Kauai's only true beachfront resort.  You can see the beach from your living room and bedroom windows, and once you step out onto the shady lanai, it's only a couple more steps and you're right there on the secluded sandy beach that fronts the property!Inside, you'll find a full kitchen, beautifully updated with subway tile backsplash and custom cabinetry.  There are two full bathrooms, also recently updated.  The first bedroom is furnished with a king bed, and the guest bedroom has a queen size bed.  Both bedrooms can be closed off from the shared living areas with wooden louver doors that preserve the refreshing airflow while providing visual privacy.  Note that sound will still carry, so if you're streaming a late-night movie, be sure to keep the volume low.  The living room and dining area each comfortably accommodate 4 people.  Your private (furnished) lanai is absolutely perfect for enjoying a morning cup of coffee or evening glass of wine while relaxing to the sounds of the surf and enjoying the cool breeze.  While there are no televisions in the apartments, wifi is provided so you won't be completely cut off from the modern world.  (Only as cut off as you wish to be.)In addition to Hanalei Colony Resort I2's beautiful interior and perfect sea views of the beach just in front,  guests can enjoy the swimming pool, jacuzzi, barbecue grills, and guest laundry room.  You can walk next door to the Opakapaka Bar and Grill. Also located just across the parking lot is the Hanalei Day Spa. Just ten minutes past the charming town of Hanalei, you'll find that shopping and dining options are conveniently close.  It's the perfect Kauai vacation rental for proposals, honeymoons, anniversaries, and other romantic occasions.As with most homes on Kauai, this vacation rental is NOT air conditioned.It is very difficult to get around Kauai without a rental car. Rental cars may be in limited supply, please book your transportation needs early.Although this home has internet, the speed and reliability cannot be guaranteed due to the remote location and the service being provided by a third-party.Hawaiian Vacation Rental ID: TA-111-089-5104-02",Bay view**__**Ocean view**__**Public or shared beach access – Beachfront**__**Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarmCarbon monoxide alarm,Entire condo hosted by Kauai Kahuna,"['Scenic views\nBay view\nBeach view\nOcean view\nSea view', 'Bathroom\nHair dryer', 'Bedroom and laundry\nPaid washer\nPaid dryer\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nExtra pillows and blankets\nIron\nClothing storage: closet', 'Entertainment\n43"" TV', 'Heating and cooling\nCeiling fan\nPortable fans', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm', 'Internet and office\nWifi', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nCooking basics\nPots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nStove\nOven\nCoffee maker\nWine glasses\nToaster\nBlender\nRice maker\nDining table', 'Location features\nPublic or shared beach access – Beachfront\nGuests can enjoy a nearby beach\nPrivate entrance\nSeparate street or building entrance\nFree resort access\nGuests can use nearby resort facilities', 'Outdoor\nPrivate patio or balcony\nBackyard\nAn open space on the property usually covered in grass\nOutdoor furniture\nShared outdoor kitchen\nBBQ grill: gas\nBeach essentials\nBeach towels, umbrella, beach blanket, snorkeling gear', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises\nShared pool\nShared hot tub - available all year', 'Services\nSelf check-in\nKeypad\nCheck yourself into the home with a door code\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property\nUnavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning\nUnavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nThis place may not have a carbon monoxide detector.

You can't go wrong with this charming Sealodge condo.The spaceYou'll love the ocean views, charmingly updated interior, and accessible ground floor location of Sealodge F1.  The sliding glass doors and picture windows face the water, which means in addition to a nice ocean view, you'll catch the tradewinds and stay cool.  During those occasional times when the tradewinds die down, ceiling fans and floor fans will keep you comfortable.  A Hawaiian punee (twin bed built into a living room alcove like a daybed ) provides cool breezes and ocean views, a perfect spot for reading or napping.  The bedroom is furnished with a queen size bed  and you'll be able to enjoy watching the waves without even having to get out of bed, because the bedroom window also has a view!  The modern (remodeled) kitchen provides enough space and amenities that you'll enjoy preparing simple meals at home and dining al fresco on your private ocean view lanai.  Inside, there's seating for 4 in the dining area.  And the lovely updated bathroom has a walk in shower and plenty of counter space to share.  The guest laundry room is in the same building, and the swimming pool is nearby - just on the other side of the building - without being too close.Our Kauai vacation rentals at Sealodge are located at the end of a small quiet side road, with no through traffic, that ends at a dramatic ocean bluff.  These Princeville condos face the ocean on their lanai side.  A short hike from these budget friendly Kauai condos brings you to the secluded north shore Sealodge Beach. The jungle trail crosses a small stream then descends to a secluded sandy cove, where the ocean is shallow and protected by a reef, making it ideal for snorkeling and swimming.The Sealodge condos were built so you can see the rolling white water waves from the living room windows, the bedroom windows, and the lanai.  From all three of these locations you can hear the surf, watch for whales, spinner dolphins, and exotic birds. There is a pool and BBQ area (grills are charcoal and you must bring your own briquettes). Sealodge is comfortable, quiet, and island casual.Update 11/9/22 (*Please note that the Sealodge swimming pool is undergoing repairs and is expected to be out of service until March 2023*) As with most homes on Kauai, this vacation rental is NOT air conditioned.It is very difficult to get around Kauai without a rental car.

Newly remodeled and furnished, this condo offers breathtaking views of the mountains and private access to the exclusive Hideaways Beach. In addition, it features a new community pool and jacuzzi, smart key technology for a seamless check-in, blazing-fast wifi, and a spacious layout with two bedrooms and two bathrooms.The spaceExperiencing life in Pali Ke Kua is like nothing else on earth. This resort community is situated on the north shore of the picturesque island of Kauai, allowing you to enjoy the sweeping views of the Bali Hai Mountains while relaxing on your own outdoor lounge furniture surrounded by flowering tropical plants and trees. Be sure to keep an eye towards the mountains after a soaking rain. Kauai boasts some of the most magnificent waterfalls you can imagine!Living SpaceUpon your arrival, you’ll feel a sense of ease as you’re welcomed into the large living room with cathedral ceilings, plush couches, and large windows that allow you direct views of the surrounding scenery regardless of where you settle in. Kitchen & Dining AreaFeeling a little hungry? Look no further than the spacious kitchen that’s fit for a chef. This space has been perfectly laid out and equipped to make preparing and cooking meals a breeze with its large stainless steel fridge, oven, microwave, and toaster oven. There’s also plenty of counter space for laying out snacks, chopping up fresh fruit you picked up at the nearby market, or for mixing your favorite cocktails. But the biggest feature of the kitchen is that even while doing dishes, you’ll still be able to take in the views, so you never have to miss a sunset. The condo also has a dedicated dining room with seating for four, where you can enjoy a delicious breakfast or coffee while listening to the birds sing just outside the large picture windows. Bedrooms & BathroomsNo vacation or getaway is complete without having a restful sleep. For that reason, special attention has been paid to ensuring that each of the two primary bedrooms is furnished with supportive and comfortable beds, wrapped in quality linens, and decorated in light and airy neutral tones allowing for the view of the tropical trees through the windows to be the star of the show. Primary Suite - Main FloorThe first primary suite is found on the main floor and features a king-sized bed along with a spacious private en-suite that features a double vanity, walk-in shower, and a full-size stackable washer and dryer so your towels will always be dry, and you won't have to dread being overwhelmed with laundry when you return home. Second Guest Suite - Upstairs LoftThe second guest suite is located in the upstairs loft featuring a queen-sized bed. It also boasts its own private 4-piece ensuite with a single vanity, ample counter space, and a walk-in shower that makes getting ready each day a luxurious experience.Outdoor AmenitiesStaying at Pali Ke Kua is a decision to spend time in a true outdoor paradise. Guests swoon over the grounds and amenities where their biggest struggle each day is deciding whether to enjoy the beach the pool or head into town to explore. At Pali Ke Kua, we have a private, paved trail allowing you to walk directly to the Hideaways Beach if you're looking to experience the best of Hawaii on an uncrowded sandy beach. This area is known for its outstanding snorkeling in the calm summer months and surfing in the winter months; there’s also a chance to encounter turtles and spot schools of dolphins as they pass by.  If all that sun and fun have you feeling hungry, you’ll find the pizza restaurant on the property a fantastic option for satisfying your cravings. Don’t wait another minute! This tropical oasis is waiting to welcome you and give you the time and space to relax, unwind and fall in love with the aloha state of mind.",Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**Pool**__**TV**__**Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarmCarbon monoxide alarm,Entire condo hosted by Princeville Vacation Rentals,"['Bathroom\nHair dryer\nHot water', 'Bedroom and laundry\nWasher\nDryer\nHangers\nExtra pillows and blankets\nIron', 'Entertainment\nTV', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm', 'Internet and office\nWifi', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nCooking basics\nPots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nDishwasher\nStove\nOven\nCoffee maker', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises\nPool', 'Services\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning\nUnavailable: Essentials\nEssentials\nUnavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nThis place may not have a carbon monoxide detector.

Hanalei Bakery is a great spot for coffee and breakfast and the nearby Hanalei beach is the place to take in the ocean and mountain waterfall views or watch surfers and sailboats coast by.  After a day of adventuring in Hanalei, enjoy locally-inspired tapas at Bar Acuda or delicious ramen at Ama with views of the mountains. Tahiti Nui, featured in “The Descendants”, usually has live music and is a great place to grab a bite or an island drink. In the Princeville center, B's Kitchen is a perfect date night spot for pasta and pizzas with rustic ambiance and an enchanting open kitchen. For lunch or a quick dinner, there is an open air food court with Chinese and Thai food, sandwiches, delicious smoothies, and acai bowels.

If you’re looking to escape the crowds and enjoy your own piece of paradise overlooking one of Kauai’s most secluded North Shore beaches with turquoise blue water, you found it! We invite you to enjoy the perfect space to experience Kauai’s majestic North Shore.The spaceHale Aloha is the manifestation of the dream of living nestled in between the lush, verdant Kauai jungle and the beautiful turquoise ocean. Experience the incredible beauty of the north shore from our 4 bedroom, 2 bath, 2100 sq. ft. beach house. The upstairs living area wrap-around glass 270-degree view overlooks the tropical landscaping and the secluded beach just steps away. Directly behind the house is a lush jungle hillside that borders thousands of acres of private nature conservancy land tucked into a private, kamani tree-lined cul-de-sac.  Enjoy white water ocean views and the sound of the ocean waves from your spacious lanai or even as you cook from your granite countertop chef’s kitchen. The sun rises directly in front of the house over the ocean and you can walk down the private drive to put your toes in the sand or snorkel right in front of the house on a calm summer day at Kepuhi point with one of the most beautiful coves on the North shore just in front of the house to the right. This is the making of the Kauai experience that your soul has been longing for.A freshly painted large lanai with a grill hooked up to gas is perfect for outdoor dining and lounging to the stars and sounds of the ocean. The upstairs is an open concept design with glass on 3 sides which seamlessly flows from chef’s kitchen to dining room to living room to lanai to the ocean. Since the living space is upstairs there is a feeling of being up in the trees. There is excellent high speed internet, flatscreen with Netflix streaming, dining room, living room and lanai.Each room has lovely, stylish island decor. Upstairs is an airy king Bedroom with views of your private backyard and an ancient, sacred Rudraksha tree. Downstairs are 2 queen bedrooms and the master suite, with 4 poster hand carved teak King bed, walk-in closet, large bathtub, inside and outside showers and private lanai. There is a separate laundry area and carport. Beach gear is provided including beach chairs, cooler, umbrella, boogie boards, 2 soft top surfboards, a mid length surfboard and snorkel equipment. The North Shore of Kauai feels like “heaven on earth” attracting a consciousness and reverence for its awe-inspiring nature, combining raw stunning beauty in a mesmerizing array of impossible mountain scapes, endless beaches, lush tropical jungles and adventure opportunities with laid back surfer-vibe beach town charm. Haena beaches offer some of Hawaii's best surfing, shelling, sunning, and snorkeling. The home is just under 3 miles (5 min drive) to Ke’e Beach and the entrance of the legendary Kalalau trail which runs along the picturesque Na Pali Coast. A quick 10 minute drive to Hanalei town will bring you to a variety of restaurants and charming boutiques. Here you will also find Hanalei Bay, a two-mile white sand crescent beach, which is ideal for surfing, stand up paddle boarding, kayaking, fishing, and good old fashioned swimming. Princeville is just up the road and provides activities such as golf, zip-lining, and horseback riding. Or just take the beach chairs and walk down the drive to the beach out front.As the owners are in health and wellness, there is a concerted effort to add healing touches such as a Biomat Professional Model (heated far-infrared and negative ion mat which helps with jet-lag, increases immunity and soothes aches and pains) and a Bioaccoustic Mat (vibrational sound healing brain entrainment mat with sleep, relaxation, etc. settings) for guests to enjoy while relaxing in the living room; perfect for sore muscles after a long day of activity or for spa day treatment in your own home.A diffuser and set of Young Living essential oils make the home nourishing as well as comfortable. Yoga mats are provided as the spacious lanai deck is the perfect place to practice yoga with an ocean view.  A certified yoga teacher is available to teach at the house upon request (for an additional fee)Located in the idyllic town of Haena, the home is just a 5 minute walk to our local restaurant (Opakapaka Bar and Grill) and coffee shop or a quick drive to Hanalei town for ample delicious restaurant options, grocery stores and shopping.  Tunnels beach is a quick bike ride or drive with some of Kauai’s best snorkeling and highest chance of swimming with our local resident Sea Turtles ‘Honus’.  Please note - you are visiting the tropics and anywhere you stay in Hawaii you will likely see more insects than you do on the mainland. They are part of the eco-system and thankfully none are harmful. We feature Young Living Thieves brand all-natural soaps and cleaning products.   We use renewable bamboo paper products to reduce our impact on the environment as we strive to offer an eco-friendly home, featuring efficient appliances, lighting, recycling. Our tap water is supplied from the local purified rainwater so there is no need to bring bottled water. Please be sure to use Reef-safe sunblock during your stay in Kauai as well. We hope you love Kauai as much as we do and will make an effort to join us in these simple measures to protect this beautiful land.  Hale Aloha is locally family owned / managed so your stay will be supporting local residents here on the North Shore of Kauai. Our property manager lives just down the road in Haena and is available to ensure you have an unforgettable trip here on the Garden Isle.  Rates on Airbnb include all taxes / cleaning fees.
