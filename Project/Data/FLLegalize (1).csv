Also we voted to let ex convicts vote and they are stopping that. The people no longer have any say because of the Republicans.

It‚Äôs well past time to fully legalize marijuana in this country, but with the stranglehold that republicans have here and in Washington that‚Äôs probably not going to happen for a long time."
