You'll love my place because of the central location, free parking, delicious local restaurants, and easy commute to anywhere in the city. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travel, and families with kids. This is a new listing for the same unit I've been hosting for 4 years. Please click on my name and read all my reviews for this space!The spaceHello travelers! Welcome to our home in the city. This is a 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom space with an attic loft. There is a queen bed in the bedroom, and two twin beds in the loft. This is a second floor unit located on Western Ave., so there is some noise from the street. It does quiet down at night and the bedroom is towards the rear of the apartment so if you're looking for a city apartment that's minutes from it all, this is the one!There is free street parking on Western Ave. The Blue Line Western stop is just a few blocks south. This is the train that runs from O'hare Airport all the way downtown. If you're driving, the Kennedy Expressway 94 is just 2 blocks north, off the Fullerton exit.There is a secure lock box with 2 keys for easy check-in. We have exterior security cameras for additional security. This also means we can see how many people come in and out of the apartment so please be honest when making your booking as any unapproved guests will be charged the additional guest fee. Any unapproved parties or gatherings will be charged the full security deposit. My husband and I designed and built this unit. We hope you enjoy this simple, cozy, no fuss place that's so close to it all!",Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**TV**__**Washer**__**Central air conditioning**__**Hair dryer**__**Refrigerator**__**Security cameras on property,Entire rental unit hosted by Margaret,[],"['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-757256633941807830/original/b742e290-57a3-4945-a356-f1453e15c7b7.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-757256633941807830/original/1422e8f0-fd6a-43fd-bfdc-31665de1985d.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-757256633941807830/original/11a43003-d766-436a-9e8d-652e11b2e024.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-757256633941807830/original/6cf18331-9f85-411a-a71d-c7e4631a171e.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-757256633941807830/original/fc648f22-e58d-4f3a-a0ee-a34ddc6f6be5.jpeg']",host data is not there
