In close proximity to many of Chicago's great locations such as Wrigley Field, The United Center, White Sox Park, etc...Located in the Ukrainian Village it is a safe, welcoming neighborhood with plenty of history.The space*****We thoroughly clean between each guest with a mix of disinfecting alcohol mixed with cleaning solution. Bedding and towels are cleaned after each guest.  -----Like many places in Chicago it has some 100year old unique characters. This is a garden unit as we call it in Chicago which means its a couple steps down below outside grade. There are also plenty of modern details though like fast and reliable wi-fi connection and charging ports for phones/electronics. There is a office with a office desk/chair to work on. The bedroom has a queen sized bed with a dresser and closet. I provide two suit case stands. It has a large TV with Amazon Prime, Netflix and locals stations to watch. I provide some guide book information about the city. We put together a guide book of walk-able neighborhood suggestions. If you are long term traveling you have access to free washer and dryer.

Location is the best part of it. Many great restaurants and fun things to do around. One of the nicest areas in the City. We are literally next to Downtown! 15-20min to heart of Downtown by car or public transportation. Blue line train station close by( 24/7 working train). Going straight to the airport and Downtown. Fee parking on the street around.Other things to noteThe room is private but you will share common areas ( kitchen , living room, and the bathroom/s) with other Airbnb guests. Usually none of this get crowd because most of Airbnb guests are most of the time outside the house knowing the city, in concerts, interviews, etc, and they don’t spend much time in the house. A private apartment in the area usually cost over 120$ p/night plus taxes and fees which is in total almost 200$ p/night ! If you want save some money and being close to downtown, surrounding great public transportation and with free street parking this could be a great option for you! The room has one full size bed. If you want to add 3rd or 4th guest in the reservation I could add 1 extra air mattress with no extra fee if the reservation is set for 3 or 4. If the reservation is for 2 and you’d like to have an extra air mattress we charge $15p/night and we provide air mattress and linens for it. the room will become smaller for luggage becase you will have two beds on it. This is a good option if you want to save even more money otherwise you can book two rooms! As most houses in United States this is not made with concrete so you will hear people walking or outside sounds/noise. It doesn’t bother most of the guest but if you are a very light sleeper maybe you should choose an entire place. or have an earphone or something to block the sound. There will be security cameras ON in shared spaces only( living room, kitchen, hallways, entrance of the apartment, exits of the apartment).",Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Dedicated workspace**__**Air conditioning**__**Hair dryer,Private room in rental unit hosted by Aaron Emisael,"['Bathroom\nHair dryer\nShampoo\nHot water', 'Bedroom and laundry\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nIron', 'Heating and cooling\nAir conditioning', 'Home safety\nSecurity cameras on property\nSecurity cameras “ON” on common areas\nSmoke alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nFire extinguisher\nLock on bedroom door\nPrivate room can be locked for safety and privacy', 'Internet and office\nWifi\nDedicated workspace', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals', 'Services\nSelf check-in\nKeypad\nCheck yourself into the home with a door code\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more', 'Not included\nUnavailable: TV\nTV\nUnavailable: Washer\nWasher\nUnavailable: Private entrance\nPrivate entrance\nUnavailable: Heating\nHeating']","['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/55994c6a-8cec-4c9a-a125-81e5607b5e7a.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/a630806c-c347-42c3-9455-55d12fdbf77a.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/6b7a02cc-3dba-4730-847b-d6ca7f6a6f13.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/3ca759e9-4afc-4007-bcd5-cd5c69bd4936.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/151d69e3-9d4c-4ec9-a376-22cb786132e1.jpg']","Hosted by Aaron Emisael

Just west of Chicago’s hip Lake View neighborhood and steps from the Paulina-Lincoln/Roscoe L Station, our residential location is the perfect place to relax and recharge on any trip to vibrant Chicago. Here you’ll find cozy restaurants, low-key bars, eclectic boutiques, and all the essentials for a comfortable stay. There’s a Target just 5 minutes away on foot (home of things you never knew you needed), several banks, a Whole Foods Market, and a variety of exercise options including a YMCA, Pure Barre, and Core Power Yoga all within a couple of blocks. You’ll find a plethora of fantastic places to eat and drink just minutes away. Don’t miss the exquisite pastries from Loba Pastry + Coffee or the German delicacies from Dinkel's Bakery - both excellent ways to start the day.  In the mood for tacos? Head to Cafe El Tapatio for authentic Mexican eats. Or dig into some spicy curry or noodles at Thai Thank You (pro tip: it’s BYOB). And pizza never disappoints, especially when it’s from Pizzeria Serio. Wash it all down with a cold treat from Scooter's Frozen Custard or Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams, and you’ve got a memorable eating experience. Our place is just a 3-minute walk from Paulina-Lincoln/Roscoe Station, where you can catch the Brown Line train. The Brown Line will take you south to Downtown Chicago in just about 15 minutes, or you can head north to Uptown or Evanston when you transfer to the Red Line at Belmont Station.  Flying into Chicago? We’re a 20-minute drive from O’Hare when there is no traffic, but if there is traffic you may be better off taking public transit (and saving some $$ on the taxi or Uber fare).",Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Dedicated workspace**__**TV**__**Paid washer – In building**__**Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarmCarbon monoxide alarm,Entire rental unit hosted by Jaden,"['Bathroom\nHair dryer\nShampoo\nConditioner\nHot water\nShower gel', 'Bedroom and laundry\nPaid washer – In building\nPaid dryer – In building\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nIron\nClothing storage', 'Entertainment\nTV', 'Family\nPack ’n play/Travel crib - available upon request', 'Heating and cooling\nAir conditioning\nCeiling fan\nHeating', 'Home safety\nSecurity cameras on property\nCCTVs are installed in common areas.

Location is the best part of it. Many great restaurants and fun things to do around. One of the nicest areas in the City. We are literally next to Downtown! 15-20min to heart of Downtown by car or public transportation. Blue line train station close by( 24/7 working train). Going straight to the airport and Downtown. Fee parking on the street around.Other things to noteThe room is private but you will share common areas ( kitchen , living room, and the bathroom/s) with other Airbnb guests. Usually none of this get crowd because most of Airbnb guests are most of the time outside the house knowing the city, in concerts, interviews, etc, and they don’t spend much time in the house. A private apartment in the area usually cost over 120$ p/night plus taxes and fees which is in total almost 200$ p/night ! If you want save some money and being close to downtown, surrounding great public transportation and with free street parking this could be a great option for you! The room has one full size bed. If you want to add 3rd or 4th guest in the reservation I could add 1 extra air mattress with no extra fee if the reservation is set for 3 or 4. If the reservation is for 2 and you’d like to have an extra air mattress we charge $15p/night and we provide air mattress and linens for it. the room will become smaller for luggage becase you will have two beds on it. This is a good option if you want to save even more money otherwise you can book two rooms! As most houses in United States this is not made with concrete so you will hear people walking or outside sounds/noise. It doesn’t bother most of the guest but if you are a very light sleeper maybe you should choose an entire place. or have an earphone or something to block the sound. There will be security cameras ON in shared spaces only( living room, kitchen, hallways, entrance of the apartment, exits of the apartment).",Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Dedicated workspace**__**Air conditioning**__**Hair dryer,Private room in rental unit hosted by Aaron Emisael,"['Bathroom\nHair dryer\nShampoo\nHot water', 'Bedroom and laundry\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nIron', 'Heating and cooling\nAir conditioning', 'Home safety\nSecurity cameras on property\nSecurity cameras “ON” on common areas\nSmoke alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nFire extinguisher\nLock on bedroom door\nPrivate room can be locked for safety and privacy', 'Internet and office\nWifi\nDedicated workspace', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals', 'Services\nSelf check-in\nKeypad\nCheck yourself into the home with a door code\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more', 'Not included\nUnavailable: TV\nTV\nUnavailable: Washer\nWasher\nUnavailable: Private entrance\nPrivate entrance\nUnavailable: Heating\nHeating']","['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/55994c6a-8cec-4c9a-a125-81e5607b5e7a.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/a630806c-c347-42c3-9455-55d12fdbf77a.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/6b7a02cc-3dba-4730-847b-d6ca7f6a6f13.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/3ca759e9-4afc-4007-bcd5-cd5c69bd4936.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/151d69e3-9d4c-4ec9-a376-22cb786132e1.jpg']","Hosted by Aaron Emisael

My goal is to travel to different places besides Chicago and write about my experiences, while sharing my photos with friends and family. This will allow me to do one of the things that I love - traveling and exploring new places.

This place is located in a very safe neighborhood. Very close to the heart of downtown. 20-25min to Millenium park. Train is 7min walking. a lot of 24/7 free parking on the street. Right in the corner there is a huge super market. 24hours fast food, etc. We provide clean towels, shampoo, coffee, WiFi, hair dryer, etc. Pretty much everything you might need. Very well located in the city and close to the interstate highways.Other things to noteThe room is private but you will share common areas ( kitchen , living room, and the bathroom/s) with other Airbnb guests. Usually none of this get crowd because most of Airbnb guests are most of the time outside the house knowing the city, in concerts, interviews, etc, and they don’t spend much time in the house. A private apartment in the area usually cost over 120$ p/night plus taxes and fees which is in total almost 200$ p/night ! If you want save some money and being close to downtown, surrounding great public transportation and with free street parking this could be a great option for you! The room has one twin size bed and it’s for one guest only. You can book two rooms if you need more people! As most houses in United States this is not made with concrete so you will hear people walking or outside sounds. It doesn’t bother most of the guest but if you are a very light sleeper maybe you should choose an entire place. or have an earphone or something to block the sound. There will be security cameras ON in shared spaces only( living room, kitchen, hallways, entrance of the apartment, exits of the apartment).",Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Air conditioning**__**Long term stays allowed**__**Security cameras on property**__**Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarmCarbon monoxide alarm**__**Unavailable: Smoke alarmSmoke alarm,Private room in rental unit hosted by Mirko,[],"['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-592771654273240723/original/66612b17-d9ce-4d98-831b-7d1fb0d06039.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-592771654273240723/original/7e1c3e81-c76c-4b45-a64c-9122812d919d.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-592771654273240723/original/9273a403-a48e-4fb1-bddf-569817333d5f.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-592771654273240723/original/6c93fdc6-41c9-4bf3-a184-c281840a0a1d.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-592771654273240723/original/82274885-d817-43ed-9218-fa200336316c.jpeg']","Hosted by Mirko

Very well located in the city and close to the interstate highways.Other things to noteThe room is private but you will share common areas ( kitchen , living room, and the bathroom/s) with other Airbnb guests. Usually none of this get crowd because most of Airbnb guests are most of the time outside the house knowing the city, in concerts, interviews, etc, and they don’t spend much time in the house.

The room has one twin size bed and it’s for one guest only. You can book two rooms if you need more people! As most houses in United States this is not made with concrete so you will hear people walking or outside sounds. It doesn’t bother most of the guest but if you are a very light sleeper maybe you should choose an entire place. or have an earphone or something to block the sound.

My business requires me to travel a lot, and I love meeting new people and exploring new places.

I'm easygoing, laid-back, and happy to talk about anything you're interested in. I like music, art, architecture… whatever!

Traveling has always been something I'm passionate about. After exploring what Chicago has to offer, I find myself going to different places, that for me, have interesting cultures and history to discover. That alone makes me happiest.

This place is located in a very safe neighborhood. Very close to the heart of downtown. 20-25min to Millenium park. Train is 7min walking. a lot of 24/7 free parking on the street. Right in the corner there is a huge super market. 24hours fast food, etc. We provide clean towels, shampoo, coffee, WiFi, hair dryer, etc. Pretty much everything you might need. Very well located in the city and close to the interstate highways.Other things to noteThe room is private but you will share common areas ( kitchen , living room, and the bathroom/s) with other Airbnb guests. Usually none of this get crowd because most of Airbnb guests are most of the time outside the house knowing the city, in concerts, interviews, etc, and they don’t spend much time in the house. A private apartment in the area usually cost over 120$ p/night plus taxes and fees which is in total almost 200$ p/night ! If you want save some money and being close to downtown, surrounding great public transportation and with free street parking this could be a great option for you! The room has one twin size bed and it’s for one guest only. You can book two rooms if you need more people! As most houses in United States this is not made with concrete so you will hear people walking or outside sounds. It doesn’t bother most of the guest but if you are a very light sleeper maybe you should choose an entire place. or have an earphone or something to block the sound. There will be security cameras ON in shared spaces only( living room, kitchen, hallways, entrance of the apartment, exits of the apartment).",Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Air conditioning**__**Long term stays allowed**__**Security cameras on property**__**Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarmCarbon monoxide alarm**__**Unavailable: Smoke alarmSmoke alarm,Private room in rental unit hosted by Mirko,[],"['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-592771654273240723/original/66612b17-d9ce-4d98-831b-7d1fb0d06039.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-592771654273240723/original/7e1c3e81-c76c-4b45-a64c-9122812d919d.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-592771654273240723/original/9273a403-a48e-4fb1-bddf-569817333d5f.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-592771654273240723/original/6c93fdc6-41c9-4bf3-a184-c281840a0a1d.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-592771654273240723/original/82274885-d817-43ed-9218-fa200336316c.jpeg']","Hosted by Mirko

Such Alteration Requests may be to just change the booked room to a similar room, or upgrade a booked room to a nicer room. Sometimes the Alteration Request does not involve a room change, but simply just an alignment adjustment of our internal booking calendar. We reward your cooperation with a FREE UPGRADE in such circumstances.  In the event a room upgrade is not available, we may provide a significant room rate reduction. This allows us to accommodate needed guest extensions or necessary room adjustments due to various situations. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in accepting any Alteration Request as soon as possible. ReviewWe try our utmost to make your stay comfortable and satisfactory. It is most helpful if you notify us immediately of any issues that need attention, and we will give our best effort to rectify them. We also welcome you to provide direct comments or suggestions to the host as this is more timely and effective. On rare occasions, some guests like to serve as an inspector and write a lengthy but improper review in public without any communication with the host.  We have no choice but to spend time responding to such reviews on the same forum or contact Airbnb to address the review when warranted. We really do not want to waste our time on such matters. We appreciate the many wonderful reviews on our hosting service, and that is very rewarding to all people who are involved in making your stay comfortable.

Chicago is one of my favorite cities in the world, where I spent a summer studying at the University of Chicago. Visited major landmarks, neighborhoods, and beautiful gardens. I hope you can find my place as comfortable as you are at home.

Amazing Gold Coast/Streeterville location SECONDS from the LAKE and MAGNIFICENT MILE. Located on a quiet street, this apartment is tucked in between Michigan Ave and Lake Michigan. Steps away from the famous Drake Hotel, yet closer to the lake and Oak Street Beach. This spot is considered the best location in the city-- steps away from the best stores/restaurants in the world located on Michigan Ave (Mag Mile) and just north of Navy Pier.We look forward to hosting you!The spaceImplementing additional cleaning measures in response to the virus. Not only are we wiping down all the surfaces as we typically do, but we are utilizing ozone machines, making sure that all door handles, towel bars, and other surfaces like remote controls are also being fully cleaned and sanitized between stays. This is a quaint, boutique building (Harry Weese Historical Building) with only two units per floor.Take the elevator, and welcome yourself to this freshly renovated condo featuring:* Queen-Size bed with super comfy mattress* Full bathroom with towels & body wash, shampoo, conditioner* Full dining room set and utensils/pots/pans/dinnerware/glasses* Large, comfortable sectional sofa in Living Room * Chef's Kitchen stocked w/ all SS appliances and granite counter tops* East Facing Floor-to-Ceiling Windows with spectacular view of Lake Michigan in kitchen/dining room, and also from the edge of living room Other things to note about the space:Living/dining room has large SMART TV w/ cable provided through YouTube TV. Another SMART TV also in bedroom! DONE TO PERFECTION! CLOSE TO LAKE, SHOPPING, AND RESTAURANTS. Common rooftop deck with grill with even better views.Q: Is the neighborhood safe?A: Very much so. 24 hours a day.Q: PARKING?A: Sometimes upon request, we may have an available parking spot for you with in/out access for a below average price. Otherwise, we recommend apps like SpotAngel or SpotHero to find free or cheap parking. There are SpotHero spots near the building for your convenience, available on a first come, first serve basis. Q: Do I need to bring towels, a hair dryer, or linens?A: Nope! we provide all these things. You will have more than enough.Q: When can I check in or check out? A: Check in is 4pm and check out is 10am. Early check ins can be difficult if there are guests who checked out same day. We ask for an early check-in, or a late-check out fee, if you request either.Q: Can I come and go as I please?A: Yes. And we wouldn't trust any listing with which this isn't the case.Q: Is the place professionally cleaned between guests?A: Yes, and we take pride in providing a clean home for guests.Q: What's my total booking price? A: We honestly have no idea. With fees included, it only shows the guest how much they pay. This figure should be present after you enter your dates. Note that, pricing varies on a daily basis, and it actually uses some crazy algorithm to adjust it automatically, so we don't actually control this.Q: Are the beds comfortable?A: Some guests say they're the best they've ever slept on!",City skyline view**__**Lake view**__**Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Dedicated workspace,Entire condo hosted by Nicole And Matt,"['Scenic views\nCity skyline view\nLake view', 'Bathroom\nHair dryer\nCleaning products\nShampoo\nConditioner\nBody soap\nHot water', 'Bedroom and laundry\nWasher\nDryer\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nExtra pillows and blankets\nRoom-darkening shades\nIron\nClothing storage', 'Entertainment\nTV', 'Heating and cooling\nAir conditioning\nPortable fans\nHeating', 'Home safety\nSecurity cameras on property\nSecurity cameras in common areas of building/entrances/elevator\nSmoke alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nFire extinguisher', 'Internet and office\nWifi\nDedicated workspace', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nCooking basics\nPots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Services\nSelf check-in\nKeypad\nCheck yourself into the home with a door code\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Private entrance\nPrivate entrance']","['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-48103490/original/0670030e-a500-40eb-a5a6-5a1b44b8359c.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/5bb4f56c-0676-435d-a889-fc028f30abfe.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-48103490/original/22e75731-2469-411e-b7dc-96f299fe6c64.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-48103490/original/476fb3d9-20c2-4bbf-b5c1-34f3112abc88.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-48103490/original/e3c7d8da-331a-4cc0-bed6-97b83852e61f.jpeg']","Hosted by Nicole And Matt

This place is located in a safe neighborhood. Very close to the heart of downtown. 30-35min to Millenium park. Train is 15min walking. a lot of 24/7 free parking on the street. A few blocks around there is a huge super market. 24hours fast food, etc. We provide clean towels, shampoo, coffee, WiFi, hair dryer, etc. Pretty much everything you might need. Very well located in the city and close to the interstate highways.Other things to noteThe room is private but you will share common areas ( kitchen , living room, and the bathroom/s) with other Airbnb guests. Usually none of this get crowd because most of Airbnb guests are most of the time outside the house knowing the city, in concerts, interviews, etc, and they don’t spend much time in the house. A private apartment in the area usually cost over 120$ p/night plus taxes and fees which is in total almost 200$ p/night ! If you want save some money and being close to downtown, surrounding great public transportation and with free street parking this could be a great option for you! The room has one queen size bed. If you want to add 3rd or 4th guest in the reservation I could add 1 extra air mattress with no extra fee if the reservation is set for 3 or 4. If the reservation is for 2 and you’d like to have an extra air mattress we charge $15p/night and we provide air mattress and linens for it. the room will become smaller for luggage becase you will have two beds on it. This is a good option if you want to save even more money otherwise you can book two rooms! Smoking is not allowed. Neighbors smoke so common areas might have a strong smell of smoke. We do have diffusers and everything inside the apt. But if you have any condition, or can’t handle the common area smell, do not book as it won’t be refundable due to this matter.Neighbors could be noisy As most houses in United States this is not made with concrete so you will hear people walking or outside sounds. It doesn’t bother most of the guest but if you are a very light sleeper maybe you should choose an entire place or another place, or have an earphone or something to block the sound. There will be security cameras ON in shared spaces only( living room, kitchen, hallways, entrance of the apartment, exits of the apartment).",Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Air conditioning**__**Long term stays allowed**__**Security cameras on property**__**Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarmCarbon monoxide alarm**__**Unavailable: Smoke alarmSmoke alarm,Private room in rental unit hosted by Eladio,[],"['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-592815021305952457/original/0684b1d0-b82a-43b6-a754-657ece4300e7.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-592815021305952457/original/6bd70e7e-1ccb-460c-863d-6e58fb912617.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-592815021305952457/original/d6772f9f-65a1-48b8-a72f-f286e805bcb7.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-592815021305952457/original/6f3616fe-d838-42a2-9eca-2be6188acabd.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-592815021305952457/original/f7d95bf3-a6a2-4060-9cea-e80cf8458af1.jpeg']","Hosted by Eladio

Our 1BR apartment is a perfect place to stay on any Chicago getaway, whether business or vacation. It is professionally designed with a full kitchen, living room, and modern touch, complete with WiFi and everything you need to live.  The apartment building is within steps to stores, restaurants, transportation. It's one great spot in the City!The spaceThe apartment includes one full bathroom, with a shower, sink, and toilet. We’re all about helping you look (and smell) your best, so we provide shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in addition to hand soap and fluffy towels. Trust us when we say there’s no better way to warm up after a Windy City walk than a hot shower!  There’s ample space for guests to relax on the sofa and watch on a large flat-screen TV. Like the rest of the unit, you’ll live it up in luxury among hardwood floors and contemporary decor. The entire place has free, fast WiFi and Chicago sunshine streaming in through the windows.  Whether you’re craving a home-cooked meal or just somewhere to put the box of deep-dish, our kitchen is fully stocked with cookware, dishes, utensils, and has swanky granite countertop. Appliances include a full-sized fridge and freezer, gas stove, oven, microwave, toaster, and coffee maker. There is a common laundry area for guests which they can use during their stay. The only things missing are your favorite farmer’s market finds!!  During your stay, the whole apartment is yours and only yours.  Ever dreamed about jetting off to your own Chicago apartment? Well, now’s your chance to bring that fantasy to life. During your stay, the whole apartment is yours and only yours. What’s better than staying in the heart of Downtown Chicago? How about an apartment that gives you the best of both worlds: minutes from the most exciting attractions of the Magnificent Mile and Navy Pier, but far enough away that you can get a taste of authentic Chi-Town life like a local.  Our place is a 10-minute walk from the Wellington L Station which can take you straight into Downtown. Our neighborhood itself, though, is best explored foot, so you can meander through the quaint boutiques and tasty eateries while enjoying the lush trees that line the streets. Walk just 10 minutes east and you’ll stumble upon the spectacular Lakefront Trail, which offers panoramic views of Lake Michigan and is a fantastic place to run, walk, and people watch. You’ll never go hungry in this ‘hood. Some of our favorite places to eat include Crisp, known for Korean-style fried chicken, Chilam Balam for Mexican small plates, and the delicious Mediterranean fare at Troy. When you’re craving something sweet, walk just 2 minutes to Bobtail Ice Cream for a milkshake, sundae, or a scoop of their chocolate chip merlot ice cream. Or chocolate ice cream infused with Jack Daniels, if that’s what you’re into.  In the mood for a night on the town but you don’t want to deal with the crowds Downtown? There are plenty of low-key, exciting, sophisticated, and eclectic bars here that will be perfect for the kind of evening you want to have. From the whisky-centric Duke Of Perth to the 80-year-old Jake's Pub (they even have a jukebox) to Bar Pastoral’s wine and cheese expertise, there’s something for everyone.  And if you just want to relax and watch a show, you have options within walking distance. Catch the latest blockbuster at Landmark's Century Centre Cinema or a live drama at TimeLine Theatre Company, both about 5 minutes from our place. Not much further away are the Laugh Factory comedy club and the Blue Man Group’s Briar Street Theater for more live entertainment.  Why break the bank with a pricey rental car when you can take advantage of Chicago’s top-notch public transportation system? Our place is just a 10-minute walk from Wellington Station, where you can catch the Brown Line and the Purple/Red Line. Any line will take you to Downtown Chicago in just about 15 minutes, or you can head north to Uptown or Evanston on the Red Line, which later turns into the Purple Line.",Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Dedicated workspace**__**HDTV with Netflix**__**Paid washer – In building**__**Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarmCarbon monoxide alarm,Entire rental unit hosted by Shaun,"['Bathroom\nHair dryer\nCleaning products\nShampoo\nConditioner\nBody soap\nHot water\nShower gel', 'Bedroom and laundry\nPaid washer – In building\nPaid dryer – In building\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nIron', 'Entertainment\nHDTV with Netflix', 'Family\nPack ’n play/Travel crib', 'Heating and cooling\nCeiling fan\nRadiant heating', 'Home safety\nSecurity cameras on property\nCCTVs are installed in common areas.
