"1666819284-1","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/","Coolship Red","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/4/58839/","Bottled January 19, 2017. Appearance is a rusty amber with short-lived fizzy white head. Raspberries are still quite present on the nose, more so than I would have expected given the age of the beer. There's some light funk, oak and implied tartness to the aroma as well. Definitely a nice smelling beer. 



Taste is much more complex than the nose. Quick, tart blast up front, followed by an intriguing raspberry / oak funk and a long finish that brings back a second clear wave of tartness. Faint notes of apricot lurk in the background. 



Overall, if you like raspberries and are ok with a tart beer, you'll like this. I'm finding if somewhat of a sipper that's not quite as light and easy going down as the Tilquin Oude Gueuze I had a bit earlier, but it's definitely a good beer."

Pours a beautiful berry-red with a quick-fading cap of white. Aroma is heavenly raspberry and very mild funk. Flavors are delicious as well, with tons of berry dominating. Very tart. So tart. But, I don't review so much for style attributes, but whether I enjoy. This one took me 2 sittings."

Poured a lovely dark red color with about 1/8 inch of pink head that quickly dissipated and left no lacing.



The aroma was solidly full of raspberry, with just a light bit of grain in the background.



On the tongue, a big hit of bitterness punches the front of the palate, with raspberry dominating the rest.



The body was light, crisp, had decent carb, and a very dry finish.



Drinkability was very good, I'd like to have regular access to this.



Overall, a very good beer. A must-try if you see it."

Smell -,The nose brought to mind vinegary red berries. 



Taste - There was a lot of raspberry in the taste, but I also detected some tart cherries. It was surrounded by a vinegary presence. The profile was tart, but did not remove tooth enamel. Sourness was lessened by a dry finish.

"1666819286-16","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/","Flora","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22511/62290/","A: Retention becomes an accelerated rupture shortly after the discharge, which emanates a willowy throw-over. Nonetheless, the preceding kick-off presents a spumescent elegance, as the stretch reaches to inches ahead of that ensuing regression. That initial onset categorizes those collared inches from Arabian Oryx to shredded coconut, before the unseating takes a painter’s knife to the pebbly brim. Just below is a presentation on appearance that succumbs the Golden Shield Lichen, with a Tuscan sun appeal. The output continues with intermittent transfers, which later transcribe hues in chartreuse, as shades of dim scarlet calmly intersect. During the walk, a growing classiness from air drafts of duration, which polish an engraving collar endowment with coupled calm clarity



S: Entryway is greeted by an involvedness preempted by esters, and a countryside funk that’s just setting off. In that regard, the indulgence stretches across citrus fruits with a ploughed rusticity that incises the herbed wheat kindly. The scents carry on towards cameo apples besides the pear drop to honey bananas, while pink & white grapefruit alloy the baboon lemon kind of limes. There’s a touch of grainy malt, for the cracker-y moments, which respect the advancing yeast properties to umbrella remote spices. In the interim, a distant dank earthiness, for fresh hay and cut pastures, while pulling a dragged mustiness out from barnyard phenols. The aerated openness channels oak to the finer points inside dry/calibrated wine, as a background frowzy lays horse blankets atop cellar moths. The forward march is neatly acidic, while continuing to press earthy must on fading rose petals, before the dry & brittle antiques of wooden leather



T: A mineralogy reading, for foretaste to indulge, with the accompanying fruit + spices relating to the harvested derives. Inferences campaign on earthy farmsteads with feedlot jazz and cultivated tobacco, as a tempered acidity roots crimson red rhubarbs. On balance, a light malt baking to field hops with a toasted spiciness, while yeast properties grind along a rural bitterness. Accordingly, grassy provinces with situated granaries that stow garnered wheat. The vintage addresses contextual funk, and pushes agricultural sulfates thru river rock mulch, as fungus builds upon the air-dry acclimations. There’s a developing cue of Grüner Veltliner, by the elongated pour for grape tinges, and a furtherance for cellar natures. To that end, a docility on acidity, as notations add oddity for woodlot ecology and slurry manure, afore dry skin briefcases



M: A bright, light buoyancy with antiquated funk, and sharp vibrancy. The allotted span comes with arbitrated tartness, which is moderated throughout, as a compliment to the progressed barrenness. Thus, a thrilling attenuation that styles effervescence handily, as the timed exposure madcaps the resounding involvedness from side to side upon the clean-complete finish 



O: An environmental showcase that harvests funk habitually, with a touch of wheat malt in back to weigh hop efficiency. The moment of service is a period of effectiveness, given the dry bite for the webbed yeast densities and age aligning land-locks"

Look: Jet black with with lots of tiny floaters looking like golden stardust. No head. No lacing.



Smell: Malty, sweet and boozy. Clear notes of rye, molasses and coffee.



Taste: The rye is very present with the molasses adding sweetness, the coffee bitterness. Dark chocolate is there, malty and woody hints as well. The boozy barrel notes keep everything together very nicely. 



Feel: Full and thick. Rather creamy than syrupy. Very low carbonation.



Overall: At first, the combination of rye, molasses and coffee didn't sound too promising to me as I'm not a big fan of any of the three flavors in my stouts. However, in this case every single one of them adds to a perfectly balanced taste which, together with the creamy mouthfeel, results in a fantastic beer."

Clear (?) seal brown liquid with a faint tan collar. Vague sheen of tears; no head development. 



Rich, balanced aromas of coffee, roast malt, chocolate covered cherries, faint pipe tobacco, and molasses; perhaps an earthy hop note at times. 



Unctuous palate entry suffused with all the flavors from the nose, dialed up. Bittersweet chocolate, bright stone fruit/berry notes, leading to layers of cocoa, loam, treacle, and toasted brown sugar. Malt exhibits moderate roast qualities, but more forward character comes from the coffee and barrel. No char. Low bitterness. Medium-dry finish. Decent complexity, but more focus on balance and smoothness I think.



Oily, rich, medium-full body with dangerously disguised alcohol. 



Excellent example of the style, although, perhaps, the base beer is a touch subdued. Maybe not the best value, but I won't dock any points for that..."

The nose is essentially a perfect ba coffee stout nose, and thus elevated the overall score a bit: huge and full coffee with tones of bean and grounds plus earth, bittersweet dark chocolate, rye, dried date, plus huge rich barrel notes with an emphasis on the molasses and vanillin laiden bourbon, wow. Taste has brighter complexion with semi-sweet chocolate, raisin, and barrel is not as powerful, loses the rye and some earth tones, but still excellent. Feel is chewy yet medium bodied, good barrel with the warmth in particular, but coffee is the clear star with roast and percolation for days.

750ml corked/caged bottle served in a tulip. Bottling date 08/26/2020. Bought it earlier today at Chuck's Hop Shop Seward Park. It was expensive.



Pours a dark purplish red with a small to nonexistent head -- a thin white ring around the glass, with sparse carbonation. Fairly hazy. Smell is rich berry jam and oaky acid tartness.



Taste is similar -- rich berry jam, more on the oak and less on the acid, almost a funk to it, and something that hints at a butteriness, not diacetyl, but something that just makes it seem fuller and richer. Moderate fruit skin bitterness characteristic.



Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very dry. Overall, this is a very good beer."

Notes on label: ""For this Schaarbeekse Kriek, we macerated locally grown and manually harvested sour cherries for almost fourteen months in wooden barrels, with both one-year and two-year old lambik. The final fruit intensity is about 318 grams of Schaarbeekse per litre of finished Schaarbeekse Kriek. The average age of this beer upon release will be at least two-and-a-half years.""



Clear, cherry red colored body. Fizzy head quickly disappeared. No lacing.

Aroma is cherry, funk and oak. Funk is more leather and tobacco like. Indications of sourness but the oak gives off an old wood fibe.

Taste is quite sour, each sip leaves the mouth dry. There is a sour cherry flavor that still gives off a brief hint of fruit sweetness. At this time the funk flavor is showing less than what is in the nose, but remains in the leather and tobacco expression. Has quite a bit of oak tannins, especially on the exhale of the breath and in the released air from the stomach.

Medium mouth feel. Good carbonation.

Very good fruited lambic, although could likely increase more complexity and funk expression with bottle aging."

Smells of roasted, caramel malt, with a strong vanilla and chocolate notes, as well as some maple syrup and bourbon, with hints of licorice and oak, but no trace of coffee. Taste is a good balance of roasted, caramel malt and a strong vanilla and chocolate, as well as smooth bourbon presence, with lighter notes of maple syrup and just a hint of licorice, tobacco, coffee and charred oak. Finishes bittersweet, with a light sweetness and some vanilla, chcocolate, bourbon and oak lingering in the aftertaste. Full, creamy mouthfee with a rich body and light carbonation.



While I was slightly disappointed by the lack of a really vibrant coffee note here, I very much do like the strong, yet smooth, bourbon presence though, warming but not overly boozy for the ABV, as well as the intense chocolate, vanilla and maple syrup notes that never become too cloyingly sweet, being balanced well against some roasted malts and earthy notes of licorice and charred oak. While I will admit that this is last year's vintage, I've had other coffee stouts at a year or more old that had WAY more coffee left in them, but perhaps a very chocolate-forward coffee was used here, as this feels almost more like a chocolate than a coffee stout to me. Body and mouthfeel really are incredible here though, very rich and creamy."

O: First Transient review for me I believe. Never really got into these guys as I'm more old school. But they're really making a name for themselves with the -uckley series with 2 of them in the Top 250 now. Most recent 2021 edition here, haven't seen 2022's yet. This one comes a bit hot for me. Little boozy and tingly on the tongue. Aroma is a little suppressed. Reminds me a bit of Vanilla Noir from Prairie if it had some maple syrup in it. Otherwise the pour and mouthfeel are nice and slick, which is impressive. It's a darn good beer, not gonna lie, but maybe not world-class for me right now.

Appearance: Very dark brown bordering on black with purple undertones. The beer has a modest sized dark beige head, that also has some purple undertones which faded fairly quickly to a nice ring. Nice looking Imperial Stout and the purple undertones are a nice touch..



Smell: Prominent raspberries, moderate Bourbon aromas and brown sugar aromas, and mild roasted malts/coffee aromas. The beer has a good nose featuring the raspberries.



Taste: The palate features raspberries, moderate bourbon notes, modest chocolate and roasted malt notes. The taste profile is nicely balanced and while the raspberries are very apparent all the flavor elements work well together. The beer starts off fairly sweet but dries up a bit. The beer has a mild alcohol presence for the listed 14.56% ABV.



Mouth-feel: On the heavy side of medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation that results in a nice mouthfeel for this beer.



Overall: Another well done Bottle Logic stout. The taste profile nicely balances all the flavor elements resulting in a very cohesive taste profile. Very nice."

The lacing was just as impressive; it remained in the glass long after I finished.

The aroma, while mild to my chemically damaged nose (Invest in a decent respirator people!) still got through some dark fruits (plums, raisins) and bourbon. Hmm, smells pretty good.

Taste followed, along with some coffee; both in the warmth of the initial sip and the bitterness of an overly roasted bean. Interesting!

The feel was also very good; viscous enough for the ABV but not chewy- just nice, smooth sipping.

OA, this is a very good BA stout, and I'm a bit perplexed by it's sub top 100 in stouts ranking, but I suspect that means I just need to try more stouts.

Also, in my opinion alone, I believe the non BA version to taste a little better. I have to have them side by side to verify."

The flavor is dominated by rich dark chocolate, baking cocoa powder, espresso, bourbon, some butterscotch and caramel sweetness, tobacco, vanilla, oak, leather, and a hint of smoke. Coffee and earthy bitterness lingers, tamed by hints of bourbon sweetness.



The mouthfeel is thick, rich, oily, and fudgy. Ample carbonation prevents it from being too sludgy.



This is a wonderful BBA stout. Rich in flavor, doesn't detract from the flawless base beer."

Personally I like the regular Ten Fiddy better, which I admit is strange. But that said, Oskar Blues did a fantastic job finding the right blend of bourbon barrels to impart a variety of interesting, well balanced nuances to the base stout. The oak and vanilla from the barrels are prominent but not overwhelming. There is a nice, burnt, candied sugar flavor, then the undertones of espresso and chocolate malts.

Head is three fingers of off-white foam, which retains well. Aroma is sticky caramel, toffee, raisins, and bread pudding. A little yeast spice counters the initial sugary notes, with bready, caramely, light earthy malts firming up the whole thing. Clove adds a bit of herbal bite to the mid-section.

Spicy yeast esters work well with bready, caramely, earthy malts to balance out the initial sugary notes, without smothering them out. In total, it has a hearty bread pudding taste without being over zealous in sweetness.

Taste is likewise bready, balanced, and complex.

L- Even rested/chilled it forms head really fast, so pour super-slow. Pours deep chestnut brown with slight haze and a mid-tan 6Cm head. There's fast rising CO2 micro-bubbles up the side of the nucleated glass. ps. Holds well and forms major lacing on the way down.

S- Strikingly deeply toasty and rich malts; it makes me imagine how a bag of ground up Maltesers might smell.

T- Again very malty, deep roasty, a notably fat but classy ABV% note crosses my palate, off into hops, then further rich malts and into a hoppier somewhat dry finish. Solid yet refined. Blimey, if you think this beer's reputation is hype, wait until you try it!

F- Rich deep roasty, the ABV% is clear enough it's similar to some liquor barrel aged beers. 

O- I picked this one for my 1950th review (the WestV12 will mark B2k). I was conscious of the brewery's repute and hype surrounding it, the difficulty getting their beer etc etc. Would I be underwhelmed, would I be underwhelmed but feel somehow obliged to rate it high. No way at all, this is a seriously luscious beer. Now perhaps some people might not like the fact that a 'mere' 8% beer lets you get an ABV% zing from it - some regard this as unclassy - but it works well within the rather glorious whole for me.

Reviewed on 1/1/18. Poured into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.



A: Very dark brown to black, and opaque. A minimum of visible carbonation, and only a tan ring of foam. The foam stays around, but no real head formation.



S: Bourbon, chocolate, caramel, vanilla. Waffle cones and tobacco. Dark roasted malts with a modest roasty bitterness. Mild oak tannins. Quite a nice aroma, especially for non-adjunct stout.



T: Bourbon and dark chocolate, vanilla and caramel. Sticky dark roasted malts, milder coffee, Oak, tannins, more vanilla. Some drying tobacco within the tannins as well. Then more sweet bourbon and chocolate in the hang.



M: A nice heavy, thick and sticky body. Carbonation is low but fine for style. The alcohol flavors are very, very well-hidden for the monster ABV listed. Good barrel balance as well – obvious bourbon flavors but still lets the other flavors come out.



O: So…this is an excellent beer. Big sweet dark malty beer with good barrel presence and thick mouthfeel. BUT…I just had the Calusa Barrel-Aged Sworn to the Dark – and I think I might prefer the Calusa. It’s not a huge gap, and it’s rather like picking between a Ferrari and a Lamborghini, since I really liked both of them. Would drink this one again in a heartbeat."

I've still got the bottle here on my desk, and it's a good way to start conversations with fellow hop heads.



Zero head, zero carbonation. A dark amber color that smells like a strong port. It tastes kind of like a port that was made from raisins and maple syrup instead of grapes. The mouthfeel is weirdly oily, probably due to the use of maple syrup in the brewing process. Best enjoyed in moderation, because it's gone before you know it.



I'm glad I had the experience, but I can't see myself getting it again. It's just way too expensive for what you get. The oily character was a little off-putting to me, and while I liked the strong raisin flavor, I wasn't as fond of the maple. And in no way is it experienced like something you'd call ""beer."" You take careful shots, there's no carbonation, and it's stronger than many cocktails.

Here we are BA, my personal whale. Sam Adams Utopias. Me and my buddy Pru managed to find a bottle about 2 hours from home because we just couldn’t wait for this year’s release. This is also beer #800 for me! I’m very excited to break into this, so I’m gonna stop wasting time and open it up



Obviously this is not a beautiful pour for beer, but the presentation of the bottle alone is worth a 5. Pours clear dark amber with no head but nice legs



It’s very evident that this was brewed with maple syrup, as the nose is a mapley booze bomb. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy bourbon, sticky maple, cinnamon, sweet vanilla, rum raisin, smooth oak, dark cherry, cocoa powder, brown sugar, and a touch of honey



This is super sweet in taste, somewhere in between a barleywine and a bourbon or cognac. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting strong maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, cinnamon, dried plum, and burnt sugar. The swallow has a pretty decent burn and brings notes of sweet maple syrup, black cherry, spicy bourbon, buttery oak, brown sugar, creamy vanilla, dried plum, sherry, fig, and a touch of cocoa



A medium full body with almost no carbonation, just an alcoholic tingle resulting in a rich beer. Finishes somewhat dry but quite sweet



This is not necessarily an amazing beer, and not even necessarily a beer. However, it’s really a once in a lifetime experience, and I am thoroughly enjoying it. To good beer and better freiends!"

The beer fizz with sound while pouring, but leaves a thin layer of foam only, which disappears very quickly. The beer smells dark, smoky, brown sugar, coffee, leather, molasses and whiskey barrel oaky. The wooden, oaky barrel aroma is distinct, it’s clearly a barrel-aged strong ale.



The beer is full bodied, velvety, latte creamy, with a bit of fizz tickling on tongue. The beer is moderate sweet (it’s 2016 bottle? 6 years later it’s still not dry?), with a bold palate, with a bit sour (tart cherry), light bitter and subtle salty at back. The taste is great, renders the beer bold, but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad (which should be drier?) to me. The malty backbone is strong, and there’s dark sugar (Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico) added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints. When I sip, I sense some dark chocolate, roasted chestnut nutty, alcohol burn, salted toffee candy, leather and tobacco earthiness, whiskey filled chocolate bottle, dried fig and raisin aromas. The beer taste bold, very malty and dark sugar characters, but it’s not ester heavy nor fruity. My feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile, but just sitting still and sipping cigar. This is a malty beverage, really malty, I think it may need another 5 years of aging to became more mellow. I expect more layers in this beer, but currently it’s just a bit too sweet (malty) to enjoy."

Stickee has always been a favorite for me. I love a great quad and Firestone does an amazing job adding a barrel aged component. The nose is wonderful.

T: Taste is caramel and toffee up front before some dark fruits come in. Nice bready malt with a huge amount of sugary sweetness along with some hints of oak and vanilla. On the swallow there's more brown sugar sweetness, dark fruits, caramel, toffee, oak, and vanilla.

M: This beer is on the heavier side of things with a silky feel on the palate. Carbonation is soft but adequate for the style while the ABV ensures that this beer has a dying finish.

Beer was received last fall (2021) and has been in my cellar till today. I think it is a 2019 vintage.

The beer pours a jet black color with a fluffy tan head foaming up 2 cm even with a gentle pour. This foam slowly fades to a sturdy edge layer after the pour.

Aroma on this brew is rich dark chocolate, fudge brownie, cinnamon notes and some earthy slightly spicy pepper notes. No hint of hops nor the ABV of this beer.

First sip from the glass reveals a medium body with fine tingly carbonation and a silky texture. The mouthfeel is a little less full than I expected, but this seems a nice stout on physical traits.

Flavor is roasted malts, dark chocolate, and fudge. I then get some cinnamon and peppery notes, with very mild tingly warmth buried in the background. This warmth does show up again on the burps on the beer. I never get any hint of the ABV and hops are absent on flavor profile too.

Mack's Beverage in Parma, Ohio. Well yes, the place was very cool and had a lot to choose from. But i was really surprised to see multiple vintages of Abraxas on the shelf. The different years were different prices so i just bought the oldest and most expensive one which was a 2020. $25. Worth a try. Poured into a snifter and man that head just disappeared as soon as i poured it. Color was dark brown. The smell is sweet like cocoa and coffee, with a tinge of spiciness to it that tingles the nose a bit. Taste is rich and velvety, warm smooth melting chocolate and a slight bitterness of coffee. Yes the cinnamon is also there enriching the experience. I'm looking for more chili pepper in the beer. It's slight but not nearly strong enough to get my top marks. I like it when the beer bites back. Mouthfeel is thick, rich, and full, bubbling only the slightest bit. Another reviewer compared this to Christmas Bomb and Xocoveza, and having had both those beers, I would say this rates pretty highly up there with both of those brews. Overall this is an awesome beer, and definitely one of the better stouts i've tried. There's nothing spectacularly unique about it, but as far as a stout goes, this sets the bar pretty high, manifesting what a stout can be if it's done well and done right. Cheers!"

A pretty leisurely pour into an imperial pint glass produced a thick, beautiful 4 inch tan head. The head itself appeared slowly and almost dramatically, and only after I'd stopped pouring. It breaks down slowly, forming a 1/2"" cap with fantastic lacing.



Smelled of molasses, cinnamon, cacao, and chilies. This is a beautiful aroma, very reminiscent of Christmas Bomb, but smoother and more refined.



Taste followed the nose, but with pronounced maltiness that really ties the whole thing together. Too often, winter releases use cinnamon either to conceal deficiencies or act as second fiddle to sugar or honey. Abraxas employs the chilies and cinnamon to great effect, creating a flavor profile that perfectly compliments the vanilla and cacao. To drink this brew is to drink mastery in action.



The mouthfeel of this beer is complex. Drink it before the head dissipates, and you have a milkshake. Drink it after the head reduces down to a 1/2"" cap, and you have a thick, viscous, smooth delight. Very light carbonation.



I paid around $25 for a 750ml bottle, and it was worth every penny. This is perfect for a Christmas get together, or just a cold winter night. Most definitely in the same class as Christmas Bomb or Xocoveza, but Abraxas is the elder statesman of the group. Buy it, and be prepared to be amazed."

Scored this bad-boy pre-aged from the best beer store in the state (shhhh... it was $6)



Pours up black, smelling boozy and woody. This is breakfast in my ****ed-up world, cheers! Extremely milk chocolate sweet but the sweetness is thankfully cut by the barrel and spirits. But still, molasses, raisin, mocha coffee dominate. It's drinkable, but HOT, even considering the 11.4%. Other 'competitors' cover up the alc more betterer, but maybe that's the point here. If you are a boozer, you may appreciate this aspect more; me, I'm a beer'er and this is too busy to be beer. I'm a purist in a weird way, and this just has too much going on. The wine and oak don't add anything, it's just all harsh grain alcohol cutting through saccharine dark fruit. Perfectly drinkable, but why?"

If my car ran on The Abyss I would do much more walking and biking. 

It’s dark. Like an abyss! Wow, ironic!

It smells like cocoa malt candy joy. It smells like Jamaican Blue Mountain if it was half as good as they say. 

The taste absolutely follows. It’s all been said before. Malty chocolate caramel licorice dark fruit heaven. It’s good! There’s some alcohol in that taste, however, more than most are willing to say. 

You guys try that French toast version that’s around in 2021? Odd! Add cinnamon and maple to the above and you have it.

It's been so long since I managed to get my hands on a decent mexican chocolate stout, so this BBA brew goes down a real treat. I've had regular Oro Negro before and really enjoyed it, while the BBA version feels a lot richer, with the bourbon character coming through marvellously here. While this also makes the beer a little bit more sweet and boozy, with that bourbon and additional vanilla notes really standing out, the spice and roasted notes balance this out very nicely, with the chili heat being just right for my personal taste.

Wonderful aroma. Bourbon isn't as prominent as other Jackie O's BBA stouts. Smooth and semi-sweet, with vegetal pepper notes along chocolate and vanilla.



Really nice melange of flavors on the palate. Peppers are very restrained, noticeable for my palate only from very large sips - but I get very little pepper in chili beers normally unless it's strong and prominent. Chocolate is rich and smooth; the vanilla is complementary; I don't get any cinnamon; the bourbon, as with the nose, is restrained but wonderfully complementary. Overall flavor is a big, semi-sweet imperial stout, arguably more of a dessert stout than a chili stout - quite reminiscent of the last few years of Mexican Cake.

L: Poured an inky black with no real head to speak of, and what little did form vanished quite swiftly.



S: Thick black bread leapt out of the bottle upon the cap being removed, and swirled in the air during the pour. Alongside it, blackstrap molasses, petrichor with fresh herb garden topsoil, chopped walnut, and oaky booze are prominent in the nose when cold. As it warms, the walnut aroma becomes far more prevalent.



T: When cold, this opens as a mouthful of herb garden soil just after a spring rain, with both chopped walnut and wet green walnut husk present. Black bread lurks in the background, and oaky tannic barrel notes slither around the edges. The aftertaste contains a touch of spicy heat. As it warms, those characteristics remain, but additional layers begin to appear - some dark sugary fruit like raisins, figs, and dates, molasses, a tinge of leather, and some distant cocoa. The heat remains in the aftertaste.

The foam that forms on the beer is a light brown and has a puffy texture. The head rises to a finger high and has decent retention. Not a ton of lacing but a few small webs and some spottiness.



S- Woah, didn't expect the walnuts to make a massive difference but the first thing I smell upon pouring the bottle, from a few feet away, is toasted walnuts. The nuts combine with the roasted malts, which are chocolately and fudgey, as well as some caramel notes to remind me of turtles or a nutty, caramel chocolate treat. Bourbon barrel comes next with some vanilla sweets, slight wood and hints of whiskey. Strong cocoa as well as hints of earthy cinnamon. Not picking up on the peppers here.



T- Not quite as nutty as the aroma but the walnuts are still present throughout and one of the main flavors along with the cocoa and the barrel which gains considerable strength on the palate. A bit of habanero heat in the finish but no obvious pepper flavor, which is probably a good thing if we are being honest. Vanilla beans are strong with caramel, milk chocolate, roast barley, spicy Bourbon, medium toast oak and spicy cinnamon notes.



MF- Medium bodied and a little bit thinner than I expected after smelling and tasting this one. I guess it just lacks creaminess and is lightly frothy instead. Fairly slick and oily but not syrupy. The carbonation is moderate and it finishes with moderate alcohol warming and some heat from the peppers.



Reminds me of a walnut, caramel and chocolate cluster and I am impressed by how much the walnuts are expressed in the final brew. The flavor is where things really balance out nicely but the body could be just a bit creamier if I am being honest."

Caramel, toasty, and light bready malts shape the rest of the beer aroma profile. Sweet cognac and light bourbon heat pair up with barrel character for a subtle twist of heat within an otherwise sugar nose. Flavor profile is cognac booze right up front, paired together with dark fruits and figs. After the opening act, bourbon, brown sugar, almond, and grassy, herbal hops take over, forming a slightly sticky, firmly sweet flavor profile. Barrel character is minor, instead allowing individual liquors to shine and simmer in the spotlight. Wonderful dynamics and shape from start to finish.

Pours a vibrant golden color with a finger of medium density white head that receded to a thin ring. Aroma is excellent. A combination of wine barrels, orange, lemon and miscellaneous tropical fruits burst from the glass. Maybe a little bit of tart funk, but it definitely takes a back seat. 



On the tongue, the funk is much more present. The taste leads with wine barrel / oak funk. Mid palate I get some tropical notes, along with wildflowers. I don't believe any dandelions are in this beer, but to me it tastes like they are. On the very long finish, the funk has more of an earthy feel. Surprisingly full body.

2019 vintage - 375ml bottle - poured into a Zinfandel stem at 45°F.



With a loud, forceful *POP* of the cap, Juicy pours a slightly foggy deep burnish orange-amber hue - rather dark, forming just a razor-thin collar with some slow lazy rising bubbles.



Nose: My goodness, this is striking. This is a mandarin orange - freshly peeled and squeezed until the juice begins to run. Not naval, not Cara Cara, not mineola - mandarin - joined by gooseberry, white grape, Meyer lemon, apricot, gingerbeer, green apple, cloudberry jam, all swirling amidst some subtle barnyard funk, wet hay, petrichor, cellar stone, wet leaves, wine-soaked oak, old books, some zesty acidity, and these immensely complex perfume notes. This may be the single most impressive aroma I've encountered. My first ever 5 on anything. I don't hand those out...



Palate: Juicy greets the palate with that soft, restrained Hill Farmstead tartness - citrusy - with a noticeable malt sweetness behind it. There's almost some IPA influence, with juicy flavours of grapefruit, pineapple, fresh grass, gooseberry, white grape, and some serious sauvignon blanc influence. Mid-way, the subtle acidity fades, revealing some grainy malt, and a musty, overripe dankness emerges. The brighter fruity notes begin to give in to some grassy character, orange pith, lime leaf, and some bitter peach pit. Some resinous Nelson hop character emerges, still bacled by some lemon zest, and then vinous wine cask, tannic grape skin, and lightly bitter hop resinous waft through the finish.



Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is medium-bodied, with a touch of weight to it, despite its small size. Effervescence is ultra-fine - on par with champagne, but much, much softer. Some dry tartness up front, fading to semi-dry with grain poking through, and then finishing mostly dry, with some tannins and resinous hop oil cling.



Overall: This is a truly spectacular example of what creativity, nuance, and new boundaries can achieve. This farmhouse ale displays a rare quality of not really having an equal - as in, nothing really compares to it. It's a saison, but it has some pale ale spirit, but it Nelson-hopped, with theae heady, exotic elements that pair seamlessly and beautifully with the wine barrel, and everything about it is so perfectly rounded and softened, like a river rock smoothed by the waters of time. One of those rare, inspiring bottles that just sings in harmony."

Bottle to snifter. Share with DC.



Look: swirling foamy eggshell head. Excellent retention.





Aroma: Chardonnay, perfume, floral, very pungent aroma.



Taste: ginger ale, white grape, ester, ash



Feel: Dry finish. Medium body and excellent carbonation.



Very excellent and unique. Changes as you sip. Each attribute seems to add to the whole in unexpected ways. Kind of like a wine spritzer.

Pours hazy copper with a half inch head of white with a vigorous pour. Minimal retention or lacing. Surprisingly low carbonation for the style. Light notes of cider vinegar, grape must, wine barrel, and wet hay in the nose. Light bodied with a slickish, thinnish mouthfeel. Vineous and tart on the palate with undertones of Burgundy, citrus, and apples. Finishes fairly dry with some lingering tannins, red fruit, and grapeskins.



Nice beer but proper carbonation for the style would really help the aromatics and mouthfeel. Not really getting a ""juicy"" impression either."

L: pours a perfectly clear gold/amber with a moderate white head that fades after a couple minutes. Leaves a great ring of foam around the edge with some moderate lacing



S: lives to its name with the first whiff, really gorgeous and deep tropical fruit and citrus aroma. Followed behind by a mild tart/barnyard funk and great depth from the wine barrel aging. Grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, some apricot, orange, pleasant acidity



T: follows the nose well, fruit nose comes through but takes a backseat to the base ale. Slightly funky, nicely tart farmhouse flavor with some notable wine barrel structure and depth. Fruit there from the nose, increasing as it’s warmed. Again grapefruit and pineapple, more of that orange as well as apricot. Medium long finish



F: light+/medium- body, medium/medium+ carbonation, slightly drying, moderate acidity



O: a delicious farmhouse ale (no surprise there) with a really great and differentiated nose. Up against stiff competition with the rest of the HF line-up, manages to differentiate itself well"

Silky black with a minimal bubbly head. 



Aroma of huge spices and hot fudge, with emphasis on nutmeg, vanilla, and cinnamon, but with extended depth and oak sweetness. Slightly coffee, with coconut and more fudge. 



The beer is like your childhood - but barrel aged. Huge fucking BARREL AGED nutmeg in your face. Cinnamon. It's so Christmas-y, and rich and full. Tons of fudge in the background with hot caramel sauce and peppermint coffee. Fading notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, fudge, and bourbon. This is magic. 



Feel is a bit thin from the barrel but still within thick stout territory. Alcohol heat is evident and welcome, with a slightly slick feel and a hot finish. Good carbonation too. 



Overall,. an absolutely phenomenal, incredible beer that I wish I could find here in Tulsa to take home via package liquor but unfortunately could not. Do not waste your time on mediocre beer. Life is too short. That is the greatest lesson I have learned in 3,000+ beers. If they suck, walk. Prairie does not. Worth the $17, even at the bar. Created a memory burned into my brain.

Much like thatch, the Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb layers in the glass with a patient swirl of coffee-like creme. Ominously dark and carrying a mirror-like sheen, the deep and deviant perfume overcomes the nose with espresso, holiday spice, dark chocolate, grilled fruit, vanilla, whisky and cream. Its lavish taste slathers the early palate with toffee, vanilla, molasses and a general gingerbread flavor before the chocolate and char follows closely behind.



Develops a more earthy character through the middle palate, those fresh flavors are decadent with bittersweet chocolates and roasting walnut in its bitterness power. A syrupy chocolate taste and texture is matched with the spiciness of sharp cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove and vanilla as the barrel's taste of oak, caramel, toasted cherry and grape give a soft vinous tone in the end.



Remaining rich, viscous and off-chewy, the beer's full and creamy body weighs on the tongue with the low-lying carbonation that ensures full saturation of the tastebuds. Trailing with a long, heated warmth of good 'ole Kentucky bourbon, its the chocolate and vanilla that provide balance with a simmering warmth of holiday spice in mulled ale form."

The rest of the day/night will consist of old classics, but it’s nice to open something fancy for my last review of 2021. Let’s get into it



Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing. Eventually fades to absolutely nothing but it's still a decent looking beer



Man, I'm really digging the nose on this one, funky and delicate at the same time. I'm picking up on aromas of white grape, white wine vinegar, tangerine, sharp oak, and earthy apple



It's straight up explosive in taste, in your face and complex while being downright drinkable. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart green apple, sour white grape, wet hay, sharp oak, lemon zest, and crackery malt. The swallow brings notes of earthy white white, old leather, tart white grape, apple skin, sharp oak, floral honey, and lemon zest 



A light medium body pairs with fine carbonation, resulting in a tart and crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with just a touch of residual sweetness

Aroma struck me as a mix of mild grapefruit and citric hops along with smidge of tropical fruits and floral notes. Fuller-bodied, slightly sticky, a touch of booze and maltiness in the beer but mostly a tropical fruit sweetness that balances with a floral hoppiness and then a touch of citric zip on the finish. Great balance between different aspects and well-hidden booze make this an enjoyable beer."

Pours a turbid mango-gold body topped with a rounded, fluffy two and a half fingers of white foam; excellent head retention leaves a mound of cap, a slight, frothy collar, and a moderate spread of soapy, spotty lacing around the walls of the glass.



Aroma shows traces of resin as it opens, withholding overripe peach, papaya, hints of bready malt, and guava briefly as the bouquet develops; creamier tones of mango build, further accentuating guava, tangerine zest, and slight suggestions of peach and pink grapefruit over time; a lush, tropical bouquet with defined, hoppy edges.



Taste offers lime sherbet upfront, a semi-tart introduction to what is eventually a touch piney over the mid-palate and effectively accented with peppery, pithy citrus zest; pineapple, bay leaf, and apricot zest show depth into the back end as overripe mango and sweet bready malts shine into the finish.



Mouthfeel brings a medium body alongside a mild carbonation deferring to a significant creamy texture dominant into the mid-palate, where a prickly resin into the back end glides toward an increasingly slick, stiff, yet easy finish.



A great entry into the NETIPA category, perpetuating in equal parts the tempered abrasion matched by the burly profile which can be found in this (sub-) style; a pointed alcohol presence, abundance of flavor, and creamy, weighted texture to tie it all together; spectacularly consumable 11.5% ABV."

Consumed 4/12/20



I’ve been waiting to have this guy for awhile as Bomb is one of my first strong stouts that I’ve ever loved. Some other Prairie stouts can have too many adjuncts for me to really love, but I’m hoping BA Bomb hits the ride balance. First thing I notice is that it seems thinner than other Prairie stouts I’m used to. There’s very little carbonation too, even for a stout. I wonder if the age has something to do with that. Some lacing does stay though after the pour. On the nose I am not getting a lot of barrel but some spice like a regular bomb. I taste a bit of the pepper but not a lot. I think that’s usually what goes after aging. It’s sweet but not overly so. There’s barrel flavor too. Chocolate and vanilla notes a prominent. The beer is great but I wish I had it fresh. I think the aging has muted some of the best components of the beer. The barrel is perfect though. Great beer and worth seeking out!"

A: Black pour. A little bit of a beige head struggles to form and ultimately fails. Little to no lacing. Not all that concerning for a barrel aged beer of its strength.



S: The chiles are much more forward on the nose than expected, and that’s the first whiff emanating from the glass. Heavy dose of roasty coffee next, followed by a fat fudgey chocolate smell. Chocolate sauce and German chocolate cake. Roasted malt. Oak and whiskey come out more as it warms. 



T: In taste, it’s the massive tide of chocolate that hits first. Tons of hot fudge sauce, chocolate truffles, German chocolate cake, fatty nibs, etc. Lots of vanilla too, mingling for a malted milkshake impression. Nutty and roasty coffee brings in a mocha flavor. Lots of whole chile taste too. The heat is extremely mild, but the flavor is big and rides to the forefront for a bit. Oak and whiskey are actually the quietest component, surprisingly, but that sweet whiskey flavor does round things out nicely. Smokey coffee and a tingle of chile heat on the finish.



M: Rich in body with a bit of heft. Chewy and mouth-coating. Velvety. Low and gentle carbonation. 



O: A bombastic beer overall, and a bit of a roller coaster ride. Rather than melding into a cohesive whole, each ingredient basically takes a turn reaching out and slapping you right in the palate. It’s big, sweet, and straightforward. Even a little busy, if I’m being honest. That’s not to say it isn’t good- on the contrary, I really did enjoy it. If you’re a person who likes a nice “pastry stout,” you’ll likely love it. I think it’s a solid enough beer, but its brutish approach and bold, hedonistic flavors that vie for attention rather than coalescing can’t touch the more carefully composed and elite barrel-aged stouts. Very good, but not great."

I enjoy Toppling Goliath Beers, I have yet to try their darker beers. The best by date is in a week, I need to get this one gone. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour created a bright white foamy and airy two-fingered head. The dissipation of the head left abundant lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 5, pale straw, with golden hues. The beer is mostly clear with some haziness lurking within. The appearance of the beer is elegant. 



The initial aromas in the beer are pine needles, grapefruit rind, floral esters, and herbal. Nosing further in the glass, I detect toasted bread crust, lightly toasted malts, oranges, lemons, papaya, and a touch of solvent. 



The flavors in the beer are grapefruit, oranges, melons, lemons, guava, pineapple, herbal, floral esters, bready, lightly toasted malts, pine needles, phenols, wet grass, and peaches. 



The mouthfeel of the beer is carbonated, astringent, and crisp. 



The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonations, and a fuller finish. 



The one thing that is off-putting in this beer is the carbonation, it is strong, bubbly. The flavors of the hops are wonderful but bitter with a steady malt backbone. A pleasant DIPA, not sure it is worth the high score that it has. I have better DIPAs with the harmony finessed."

A- Pours pitch black with a thin mocha colored head. Minimal lacing throughout. 



S- Dark chocolate comes through immediately with undertones of vanilla. There is a light undercurrent of cinnamon wafting in the background. I take an extra strength whiff (for science) and only then can I start picking up some stale, oxidation characteristics. It is nearly imperceptible and has no real impact. 



T- Following closely from the nose, the flavor starts off with smooth dark chocolate dominating at first, with the vanilla providing ample support. As the beer warms to room temperature, the cinnamon starts its move from the periphery to becoming a more integral component. Cinnamon is something which can easily be off putting to me in larger doses but here it is well integrated and nicely complements the stronger chocolate and vanilla flavors. No perceptible heat or spiciness to me from the chile peppers. It's quite possible this aspect has faded over time. I do think there are some remnants adding to the total flavor profile but I'm just not able to easily pick them out. The only slight knock I can give is that the barrel characteristics are minimal. 



M - Slightly oily with a medium body. Carbonation (medium) has held up quite well.

As the glass warms, I think the chocolate is stronger and a bit sweeter and the pepper hotter. The feel is viscous and creamy with lite carbonation and there's no avoiding the 14% ABV. The 12 oz. format is appropriate. Overall, this is a superb example of RIS - my favorite style, and it richly deserves its World-Class rating. I really like the combination of the chocolate malts and dark fruit."

Smell - Chocolate, bourbon, with underlying notes of cinnamon and vanilla and subtle chiles.

Taste - An almost perfect blending of Mexican chocolate and bourbon. The chiles were quite noticeable, but did not overwhelm in terms of flavor or heat. The same can be said of the bourbon. 

Feel - Mouthfeel was a touch thin on the palate but enjoyable.

Overall - The aroma and flavors were so big and well balanced that I found myself focusing almost purely on those aspects. I would have enjoyed a bit more body on the palate, but that in no way detracted from my enjoyment. This is among the best beers I've had to employ chile peppers."

The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick and viscous with a thin half finger of khaki head that recedes quickly, yielding no film nor any lacing. The aroma is pleasant, tons of fudge and chocolate, light pepper heat, tons of cinnamon, modest barrel, a nice oakiness with a good char and a bit of vanilla.

Smell is nutty roast and dry wafer with moderately spicy cinnamon and slightly astringent but fruity and popping chili pepper.



Taste has more depth yet is also refreshing, with just the right amount of warming pepper that is both mildly spicy and sweetly fruity. Cinnamon is lightly dusty and complements the roast of the moderately light-bodied stout. There's a touch of nutty cocoa but not a whole heckuva lot. The carbonation is crisp and lifting for a big stout, with tightly compacted bubbles finishing perfectly semi-dry.



This is like an older school, more drinkable stout with a lighter body and flavorings that don't overpower. Additionally--a shocking note for this day and age--it's not cloying. The only thing I'm not really experiencing here is any barrel. Not even a boozy heat."

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to leave nothing behind



S- aroma is rich with chocolate, cinnamon and chili pepper up front, followed by undertones of creamy lactose, vanilla, toffee and brown sugar. The tequila barrel comes across as a mezcal-like aroma, with some oaky bourbon juice in the background



T- rich malty chocolate up front quickly gives way to cinnamon and pepper skin. Mid-palate brings out the barrel notes; tequila takes center stage, with some oaky bourbon complimenting. The finish gives more cinnamon and chocolate, with a linger of pepper and creamy lactose



M- medium body with moderate carbonation, foamy mouthfeel turns slightly creamy into the finish. Some pepper heat pokes through after the finish

Intro: 500 mil. poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend. 



Appearance: Dark black color. Minimal head but some. Same with the lacing as we drank



Smell: Cinnamon up front followed closely with chili pepper, Bourbon brings up the back end.



Taste: Followed along with the smell. Little to no carbonation. Chili pepper is strong for my tastes.



Mouthfeel: Creamy but the chili holds that in check. Medium mouthfeel



Drink: Again, follows along with mouthfeel. I’ve had better and I’ve had much worse. It’s not my favorite selection from Bottle Logic



Conclusion: I’ve had several other Bottle Logic brews and this would not be in my top 4 or 5. It is mostly because of the chili pepper but that is personal taste. I am a big fan of the brewery, just not this particular beer. It’s still finely crafted and is deserving of the score given"

This is my first Bottle Logic brew, as I'm in Ohio so it's difficult to get California beer out here. Poured out thick and darkest brown with a quick and active head that bubbled up furiously for about 15 seconds then rapidly shrank into a ring around the bottle, then disappeared completely. The strongest scent coming up from this beer is bourbon, even though there's also tequila barrels at work. Also notes of vanilla, chocolate, and a little tingle on the nose from the ancho peppers. The scent is very strong and peppery, and threatens to singe my nose hairs if i inhale too deeply too quickly. Truly a delicious smell, very complex and tantalizing. There is a strong and sweet malt backbone to this beer upon first sip. It's very thirst quenching. After getting the rounded sweetness of the sugars and vanilla, cinnamon washes through my mouth, followed by the tequila and bourbon. It's funny, but i can definitely taste both the tequila and bourbon independently, and i didn't think i would be able to. Also a bit smoky. The pepper comes last, stinging the back of the throat and giving it a nice finish. Mouthfeel is definitely thicker and syrupy, with a nice douse of effervescence. Overall, the smell knocked my socks off. And the taste was very complex and layered. Although I wouldn't say this is one of my favorite beers, it's definitely the result of an interesting recipe and the chef certainly knew what they were doing, to allow all the various flavors to come out. So it's getting my top marks for being unique, an important quality i seek in beer."

A: Black on the pour with two fingers of brown head. Retention is good, lacing manifests in broken rings.



S: Nose is heavy on the chocolate. Brownie batter and a generous helping of Hershey’s chocolate syrup. Fatty nibs. Bit of woody roast and earthy hop. Berry-like fruity note. Nutty coffee.



T: Follows the nose. Chocolate all over the attack. Cocoa nibs, brownie batter, chocolate syrup in a big way. Sugary lactose. That berry fruitiness comes through tasting like a raspberry tootsie pop. Pervasive background flavor of nutty coffee. Quick flash of earthy hops, and woody and roasty malt flavors poke through now and again. Perhaps some subtle cola. Roasty and Chocolatey finish. 



M: Rich and thick in the mouth. Coating and almost syrupy. Tons of residual sugar. Carbonation is ample but gentle, and fluffs things up a little.



O: Might be an unpopular opinion, but this is just too sweet for me. Tree House has a penchant for taking all of their dark beers well onto the sweet side of things, and some fare better there than others. Here there is just not quite enough hop, coffee, or black malt bitterness to bring it into any semblance of balance. It does finish drier than it starts, but it isn’t nearly enough to save the drinkability. You gotta have a serious sweet tooth to enjoy beers like this, and unfortunately I find that I tend to favor balance and dryness as opposed to a candy-bomb like this. It tastes like chocolate syrup and sits like 16oz of chocolate syrup in the stomach. Looks like sweet sells though, so maybe I’m just an old grouch now."

Picked up at Shangy’s, Emmaus, PA. $ 18.00 (Including tax)/22 oz bottle ($ 0.819/oz) on 18/09/21. On room temperature shelf at store, stored at 37 degrees at home. Reviewed 09/07/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.

Stamped on shoulder of bottle in nearly invisible ink “BOTTLED ON 09/08/20”. Served at 58.6 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King Snifter. Final temperature 65.6 degrees. 

Appearance – 3.75.

First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), muddy. 

Body – Brown (SRM 30), opaque. When rear-lite, limited penetration but deep amber at the edges.

Head – Large (Maximum six cm, aggressive center pour), initially brown sugar but lightening to fawn as it breathes, high-density, good retention, diminishing to a 0.3 to 0.5 cm crown and complete, rocky cap. As the head retracts, multiple partial and complete rings of tiny to small bubbles remain.

Lacing – Good. As the level drops, a wide band of tiny to small bubbles grows, separated from the above band by tiny stalactites and stalagmites. See also above.

Aroma – 4 – Moderate fruity malt and chocolate. No hops, no yeast.

Flavor – 4.75 – Begins markedly bitter with malt, although this bitterness ameliorates as it breathes. Seems pretty straightforward in taste – malt, a little chocolate, no dark fruit, no char, no coffee. No ethanol (12 % ABV, according to BA, NOT marked on label) aroma or taste. Good gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends with hops predominating.

Palate – 4.25 – Full, creamy, soft carbonation.

Final impression and summation: 4.25 Looks like pretty much every Impy stout and RIS on the market. Both the aroma and flavor are uncomplex and good – malt and chocolate – with only a small taste of organic acids edging in at the aftertaste but not pushing out the hops. The hoppy ending is unexpected and excellent!"

It's also more bitter and hoppy than expected. The Amarillo and Simcoe adds a different dimension. The balance of sweet and bitter is terrific.

APPEARANCE

Pitch black body and a hefty three fingers of fluffy, tan-colored head



AROMA

An onslaught of leather, coffee, black licorice, tobacco, char, cherries. I mean, it goes down the list of everything you want in a superior RIS.



TASTE

Dark chocolate bomb with all of the aforementioned RIS accoutrement (fancy word) from the aroma. Most prominent is the black coffee and cherries. A finish of tobacco and smoke is blowing wind up my dress and a lingering hop bitterness has my leg shaking reminiscent of a dog getting a belly rub.



MOUTHFEEL

Smooth and velvety. There is no alcohol taste on this big bastard, but a noticeable warmth is prevalent on each sip.



OVERALL

World Class RIS. I am no stranger to Surly Darkness and will never pass up a chance to have this."

In the glass it looks almost black, but on the pour it looks a deep ruby red dark brown as light passes through. Quite pretty to watch. There is an inch plus of dense, brown foam falls to a substantial layer of bubbly goodness that laces incredibly.



The smell is rich, dark malt and more rich, dark malt. As it comes to life with warming, noticeable alcohol, coffee, baking chocolate, a dried fruit like dates and figs with some cherry. I think a slight caramel or brown sugar note creeps in.



The taste...holy mother of dark malty goodness! The promise of the aroma is delivered by the boatload. Waves of malt, the chocolate melds with the caramel/sugary and fruit notes, a mild coffee flashes by, and it becomes almost like fudge. The malt rules but doesn't overpower. Just when you think it's done, a strong bitter hit wakes you up along with a smack of booze for good measure. A very mild charred taste creeps in, but it is not overly strong.



The mouthfeel is smooth and rich, but not overly thick - luxurious and indulgent. Carbonation is tame as it should be. The quick but strong bitter hit and alcohol tingle remind you this isn't a lightweight.



Overall...I might have to go on the hunt to find more of this. I suspect it will age incredibly well. Outstanding in every way, this beer has everything and RIS should have and nothing it shouldn't - as worthy a brew as you can find."

Poured aggressively into a Snörkel tulip glass.

Thick head of tiny dark tan bubbles that dissipated to a thin cap. No lacing left in the glass.



Aroma of dark roasted malts, burnt coffee beans, raisins and char.



Taste is an abundance of dark roasted malts, coffee, bitter cacao and black cherries. Help up surprisingly well after 5 years!



Mouthfeel is heavy and full of tongue coating malts. Carbonation seems to be light, but could be due to age, not a negative. Not Eben a hint of double digit abv.

Impressively roasty aroma, along with a healthy dose of hops. Red grape, toast, moderate char, prune, dark bread, cola. It's dark, over the top, impressive, and incredibly inviting.



Thick and creamy mouthfeel, bordering on chewy. Fantastic. It feels every bit of the 12% ABV, but without harshness. It's bold enough to scare away the weak-willed, but smooth enough to reward the bold.



It's a bit of a throwback RIS on the palate: hoppy, charred, roasty, and very, very strong. Tons of dark fruit and dark bread, along with red grapes, caramel, toffee, chocolate, espresso, leather.



This is nothing less than a fantastic RIS, fully worthy of its lofty standing and rating."

Aroma is huge roasted malt notes, rich chocolate and coffee smooth and sweet with dark fruit notes, vanilla almost like cherry vanilla coke notes. All this is blended together in harmony.



Taste is like the nose rich and smooth big roasted notes. Loads of chocolate smooth and sweet but also some roasted coffee bitterness mingled with dark fruits. Hops keep it from cloying but don't really pick up bitterness except for the roasted bitterness. Finish is smooth and delicious lingering chocolate and roasted malts with the cherry vanilla coke notes.



Mouthfeel is big and smooth a creamy treat. Smooth mellow carbonation.

Smell: Moderate Bourbon, brown sugar, mild vanilla and perhaps the faintest hint of tequila. A nice smelling IS.



Taste: Fairly prominent Bourbon, mild tequila notes, brown sugar, chocolate, and roast malt notes. The beer is mildly sweet, but the tequila notes and tannic oak notes help the beer finish fairly dry with just a hint of sweetness. Subdued alcohol presence for the ABV.

Anyways, pours black, had a very thin head on tap. Aroma gave off a nice mild tequila and wood presence, I thought it was cool. The taste took on a smooth, sweet tequila and low roast low bitterness kind of stout beers. A mix of different mild sweeteners, brown sugar, agave, vanilla = smoov just doin' his thang.

Aromas open to green apple with waxy hints of medicinal mango as touches of straw accent saison yeast toward composted guava over the middle; moist oak meets waxy funk with hints of lemon peel into the back end for a culmination of active, oily bacteria bursting with funky fruit.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body with ample, fluffy carbonation on the higher end of moderate; a slick, oily funk peaks to a glistening lactic tartness over the mid-palate, mild yet indomitable as a clean brightness with a hint of prickly grit disperses through the back end, leaving a predominantly clean, activated finish.

A clear golden yellow with a dense white head with good retention and lacing. The nose is pretty excellent, a soft, bright tartness,with notes of key lime, lemon, a light, lightly toasted French oak note, mildly vinous and fruity. There's a little grape, and a real nice Brett expression, lightly spicy with a little clove and pepper and a touch of pineapple juice to go with a mild floral honey note. Really nice depth and structure. 



The palate opens tart with a nice blend of lactic and lemon acidity along with a really nice Brett funk. The lactic acidity is sharp but fleeting, priming the palate for the fruit that follows. Delicate pineapple, grape, peach and honey are present. Minimal straw notes. The Brett expression is restrained but thoughtfully executed, pairing nicely with the oak notes, tannins, light vanillin and almost vinous notes.

Look: Pours out very dark brown almost black with a deep brown colored, frothy head. The head dissipates pretty quickly but leaves a thin layer behind. Looks stunning.



Smell: The aroma is wonderful. This smells like a dark chocolate peanut butter cup. Notes of roasted hazelnuts and charcoally coffee also. There's even a subtle green bell pepper and licorice aroma on the finish, which is very interesting for a milk stout.



Taste: Interesting. It is much sweeter than I was expecting. And that's appropriate, because this is a milk stout. I think it's just that from the nose, I expected it to be not as sweet as it is. The mouth mirrors the nose, but perhaps the peanut butter flavor on the palate is much more subtle than in the aroma. Also, a lot of the sweetness is perceived to have an artificial sweetener vibe that is less than ideal for me. The finish is long and has a nice roasty, charcoally chocolate/coffee flavor.



Feel: Mouthfeel is relatively thick. This is smooth and chewy. Carbonation is spot on. Really nice.



Overall: This is my first Tree House beer that was not a New England IPA. This beer reminds me a lot of another peanut butter milk stout that I enjoyed: Gunner's Daughter from Mast Landing. One of the differences is that Gunner's Daughter does not have coffee and that Hold On To Sunshine is higher ABV. Overall, this is a really great coffee milk stout. It was hard to choose between a 4.25 and 4.5 overall; in the end, I gave it a 4.25 because the artificial sweetener taste knocks it down slightly for me."

The first sip comes with two competing forces of marshmallow and spicy barrel. The barrel almost has a cinnamon hint to it at first, but not quite. Then creamy strawberry glides in, and is just present enough to help develop that distinct Neapolitan flavor. It's fresh, seedy and mildly fruity, while the base stout is chocolatey.



The medium-light body has a crackly carbonation and finishes semi-dry. A mild but complex and mature barrel heat brings peppery char and caramel.

Pours an oily midnight-black body capped with a modest finger and a half of dense, pale mocha foam; great head retention leaves a paper-thin veil over an otherwise viscous void along with a large, creamy collar, and the occasional strand of webby lacing dotted around the walls of the glass.



Aroma opens to a healthy barrel char with tinges of ashen smoke advancing to black licorice before finding predominant, nutty bakers chocolate over the middle; dark cocoa is enhanced by subtle caramels as a medley of dark fruits enriches delicately savory, tannic qualities in the backdrop through the close.



Taste brings soft vanillins into black licorice as deep bakers cocoa waves wash over splintery barrel accented with dark fruit esters; whipped milk chocolate decadence on the back end finds spent coffee grounds and hints of bourbon underscoring the finish.



Mouthfeel shows a body on the heavier side of medium and a moderate-low carbonation, purely silky in texture with intensely focused consistency advancing to a creamy mid-palate engaging a rounded, sinewy grit; vaguely tannic leanings into the back end are masked by moderate warmth as a subtle dryness evolves through the finish.



An honest, old-school display of classic Russian imperial stout bittersweetness and borderline acridity, composed in masterful flux with a tame and well-integrated barrel; effortless despite these roastier leanings, this is another example of Hill Farmstead at a formulaic peak in composure."

75th unique beer from Hill Farmstead.



bottled on date is Jan 10, 2020.



Appearance: black bodied stout. 1-2 fingers tall; medium brown head. Big loose bubbles break the head down into a thin cap that drops down to an uneven ring. Booze legs with each sip. spotty lacing on the side of the glass.



Smell: While taking the wax off the bottle, I could immediately smell bourbon! Nice bourbon note and heavy barrel char once poured into the glass. Chocolate and smoke. 



Taste: Bourbon leads this beer with a nice sweetness and the bourbon is also lightly spicy. Dark fruits, brown sugar, molasses, & moderately roasty malt profile. Tobacco and leather. Smoke, peat moss, and ashen barrel char begin to build after each consecutive sip; deep earthy and woody character as well. Umami richness in the middle of the stout. Light oxidation notes in the form of soy sauce; it's very faint and does not distract from anything here. Meaty smoke and peat moss finish that lingers for a little while after each sip. Unique flavors here that I don't taste very often in barrel aged stouts; it's rich with mature barrel notes without being overly sweet. Complex. Interesting. Well done bourbon barrel aged stout by Hill Farmstead.



Mouthfeel: Medium bodied stout. Low and adequate carbonation levels. Creamy carbonation. Smooth and rich texture. It's not motor oil and its really great exactly where it is... in regards to this stout's texture. Damon is not at all boozy, but it does have a noticeable warming presence. This stout actually drinks heftier than the 10.5% abv & I do not mean this in a bad way at all. It's a really robust bourbon barrel aged stout and the texture lends itself to this without being abrasive at all. The beer remains smooth from fridge temperature all the way to room temperature. I solo domed this bottle and drank it over the course of two hours, it retained smooth sipping status the entire time. 



Overall: Well, this beer has eluded me for a really long time. Really excited for the opportunity to finally get to drink it and see what it's all about. I got to try port Damon back in July of this year and I think that I prefer the port barrel version just a little bit more than the bourbon barrel. Hill Farmstead stouts always tend to distinguish themselves from the crowd. It shows that a stout does not need to be sweet to be rich especially when the stout has such great texture."

Head is a finger and a half of snow-white foam. A few particulates sit at the bottom of the glass, but not much after pouring the first half of the bottle into the glass. The level of suspended particulate changes when the last 1/5th of the bottle is poured into the glass- it develops a more murky appearance, with visible silt and particulate in the bottom of the glass. Aroma is immediate peaches, but they're soft and delicate. It leans slightly into tart, but is otherwise well balanced thanks to the subtle peach sweetness. Faint cellar stone, oak, and grass occupy the rest of the nose, rounding out the depth. Peaches seem to swell in intensity as the beer warms towards room temperature. Flavor profile leads with peaches again, but leans into tart more so than the nose. It's a pretty quick transition from sweet peach to tart fruits, cellar stone, grass, lemon zest, and soft wood. Front third is fruited, with the back third being all base saison. The middle is a blend of the start and finish. Just like the nose, the peaches swell up in intensity as the beer warms to room temperature, and with that, it brings those underlying tart qualities forward. Still no puckering sourness, but it does create more contrast between tart and non-tart. No puckering or tart finish, with the finale wrapping up with a moderate dryness. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. It nearly falls flat on the tongue, with the initial portion being crisp. Overall, peach addition is wonderful, with the rest of the profile being a steadfast, focused, and balanced saison. It's not overly acidic or tart, providing just enough tartness to offer contrast, without forcing it into sour territory.

Having had a Framboise du Fermier earlier in the day, this has a relatively toastier sesame seed cracker malt and oak interplay that is likely assisted by not being anywhere nearly as sour. The frothy medium body is so much more balanced, with a just lightly tart herbal peach skin presence accented by a nutty funk.



This is actually delicate by comparison to FdF, and as such, so much more enjoyable. However, we also had a few de Garde brews before this, and the comparison to the kings of stone fruit out in the Pacific Northwest is a stark one, no matter how formidable the challenger."

Smells of riper peaches, old wood and bread dough among a lighter, stony pith quality. Got a lighter glue and blue cheese funkiness underneath, giving the fruit in this a nice little twist.



Drinks light, with an omnipresent acidity, balanced by a higher, refreshing carbonation.



Tastes of sun ripened peaches, not yet to the point of getting jammy though, due to a present acidic sourness, hitting the palate uncompromising. Turns a tad effervescent then, with a noteable mineralic note, wrapped up by older, oaken wood, adding a pleasant, funk accompanied complexity to the flavors. Finishes calmer, with maintaining sweet peaches, building a well working counterpart to the teeth numbing sourness in this, which the peaches manage to overcome during the aftertaste.



Very well rounded, fruited sour with a great balance to it, pushing successfully further than most other AWAs."

Look - poured with little head, quite dark and sludgy.



Smell - faint, maybe a little roasty.



Taste - a bit of coffee and dark chocolate but no coconut, the surprise was a chunk of something, must have been solidified coconut, that got trapped in my mouth and quickly dissolved. Nice taste, like it says on the bottle, like a chocolate cake, but I typically don’t like chocolate cake unless it’s tarted up with other stuff, and this was a straight chocolate cake taste. No alcohol or barrel to be found anywhere.



Feel - moderately thick.



Overall - a big let down for such an acclaimed beer. Firstly - I was most looking forward to that Bottle Logic Barrel and got none. Secondly, the chunk. Thirdly, the taste and smell didn’t jump out at me in any way. I mean, I didn’t NOT enjoy it, and it was cellared properly, but I’m just not feeling this one like other BLs."

Nose is earthy sugarcane, burnt brown sugar, molasses, toffee, some cinnamon, and vanilla

2019 vintage from pint growler filled at B&V. Poured into tulip glass. 



Same as prior but this time appearance was much better. Huge tan head, tons of thick lacing. Same great smell, taste and feel. About as close to perfect as I can imagine. 



Feb 2020 Review

2017 vintage from pint growler bottles at Barrels & Vines 18 months or so ago. Poured into a pint tulip glass. 



Basically the same review as in the past. This is an incredibly delicious candy bar masquerading as a beer. Appearance is probably the only weak point. Huge coconut, cinnamon, toffee, chocolate, bourbon nose and taste. ABV is well hidden; this one can get you into trouble. Super creamy moist. Still pretty much my favorite beer ever except for the high ABV and, now, taproom only distribution.



June 2018 Update

Had a 2017 vintage from a 16oz growler poured recently at Barrels & Vines. 



Very much the same as original review with cinnamon a bit more pronounced, slightly less alcohol but every bit as good as I remember. Maybe even creamier than I recal. A great beer. Have a few more 2017 in the cellar. Can’t wait! 

Didn’t get any 2018 as it was taproom only release which wasn’t practical for a SE MI beer lover.



2017 vintage (orange ball).

Pours a dark brown with a small head that took some work. Minimal lacing, low carbonation. 



Sweet smell with a delicious aroma I can't place. Maybe toasted coconut (which I don't normally like) with brown sugar. Definite booziness but very smooth nonetheless. 



Sweet right at the start but chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, other spices combine with bourbon and oak. One of the more complex and wonderful tastes I've experienced. Maybe a bit on the sweet and boozy side but I love it. Gets better as it warms. 



Mouthfeel is amazing. Substantial complexity with low carbonation that suits me just right. Like the taste, it gets better as it warms. 



Overall, one of the best beers I've ever had. Definitely a bit sweet but not overdone. The sugar and bourbon alcohol mix perfectly with chocolate, spice, vanilla and cinnamon.



Can't wait to age a bottle and drink another!"

Nose is full of oak, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, dark fruits and chocolate milk. I didn’t detect any coconut but still found this to be very complex and enjoyable to inhale.



Flavor has a lot more dark fruit, toffee and sweetness to it like black cherry soda along with brown sugar and a melted Heath Bar. It almost borders on cloyingly sweet, but that aspect helps hide the 15% ABV. Like the nose I got of barrel or oaky notes, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, more dark fruits, cocoa powder, candy and chocolate milk. None of the coconut advertised on the bottle, but a dynamic profile that was a lot more balanced than I expected. A tad bit thin, even for a porter, and while it’s overall a very impressive brew it’s too sweet to drink a bomber by yourself as I struggled having it alone. A definite dessert beer to share with a few other beer lovers."

The aroma had a solid, but not overpowering, amount of roast at the front of the nose, backed with solid grains, and just a bit of floral hops.



Similar on the tongue, a good blend of grain, roast, and soft, slightly grassy, hops.



The body was also about typical for the style, perhaps a touch fuller than usual, smooth, and had a dry, roasty finish that lingered.

Pours a glossy jet-brown body with chocolate/chestnut hues and capped with two fingers of rich, light mocha foam; excellent head retention leaves a slim layer of frothy cap, a moderate, creamy collar, and a near-comprehensive coating of mounded, webby lacing caked across the walls of the glass.



Aroma features an extensive malt char deftly interwoven with lager yeast and toasty brown bread as tinges of beechwood smoke and bakers chocolate over the middle engage minerality into the back end and hints of coffee on the close.



Taste shows touches of leathery char and burnt coffee upfront, with added nuances of bakers chocolate against a rounded lager yeast and a touch of minerality over the mid-palate; malt roast grazes the back end, while brown bread crusts and nutty coffee grounds offer a subtle inflection on the finish.



Mouthfeel brings a medium body with a medium-full carbonation, a purely silky texture seeing a sinewy backbone weaving grit and char to pseudo-creamy sensations throughout the mid-palate toward a firm, drying, and persistently roasty back end to nimble harmony on the finish.



Lagery roast finds waves of smoke and silky chocolate undertones to fuse with an obsessive Hill Farmstead precision of texture, bringing the modesty of an American Porter to climax with detailed expression on an otherwise restrained medium."

Feel: perfect body; thick but not chewy or overly sugary. Carbonation was on point and makes this eminently drinkable.

Overall: hands down one of the best--if not the best--porters I've had in a while. Would definitely seek this out as a winter-warmer, or after dinner drink. Best of all, the ABV is manageable and leaves room for another glass."

Hill Farmstead Brewery

Date: 18 May 2021

I nearly fell out of my chair when I discovered I was given this beer. Hill Farmstead is on my shortlist for must-visit breweries. They have several beers I want to consume. They have a best-by date to drink: furthermore, I am sure it is okay; it is only a couple weeks past. The beer was carefully maintained to preserve its integrity of the beer. I poured into a Willi Belcher glass; the temperature was 46 degrees. A frothy and creamy three-fingered dark tan head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 24, dark oily brown. The appearance of the beer is beautiful. 



Oh wow, the malty profile is vibrant and aromatic. I smell dark roasted malts, chocolate, medium roasted coffee, a hint of floral, leather, intense earthiness, and subtle char note. 



Coffee and chocolate smack your tastes buds in the sweet spot. Dark roasty malts, toast bread, a touch of floral, a dab of Maillard, a tinge of char, tobacco, leather, earthiness, and a slight herbal note is what I taste next. The beer is a parade of flavors doing a technical difficult choreograph dance with precision on your palate. 



The mouthfeel is a little bit bitter, with some creaminess followed by a skosh of dryness. 



The body is medium, medium carbonation, and has a long and delightful finish. 



One of the best porter I have ever consumed. It has all the great qualities of stout but in the porter style. I love the robust flavors and creaminess with the bitterness."

Received in early June 2021 in Ninja box from @Roy_Hobbs. 16 oz can stored at home at 42 degrees. Reviewed 1/7/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.

Bottom rim stamped “CANNED 05/18/21 DRINK BY 09/18/21”. Served at 53.0 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 60.6 degrees. 

Appearance – 4.5.

First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear. 

Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. When rear-lite, opaque but translucent amber brown at the edges.

Head – Large (Maximum 5.5 cm, aggressive center pour), wheat, high density initially but quickly opening, average retention, diminishing to leave a 0.7 to 1.0 cm lacy crown and a thin complete cap. An archipelago of foam islands resembling coral atolls remains on the sides of the glass above the crown. Second pour produces a dense 0.7 cm head. 

Lacing – Fair. Wide band of tiny bubbles, separating into two bands, with short, blunt, stalactites. See also above.

Aroma – 4.25 – Begins with roasted malt and cocoa, no hops, no yeast, no coffee.

Flavor – 4.25 – Begins slightly sweet with roasted malt and cocoa and a hint of coffee, no hops, no yeast. No ethanol (7 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. Slight gastric warming does occur. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends slightly bitter.

Palate – 4 – Medium, creamy, soft carbonation. 

Final impression and summation: 4.25 Very velvety mouthfeel. The first few swallows went from slightly sweet to very bitter with alarming swiftness, but then it seemed to smooth out, just ending slightly bitter in counterpoint to the initial sweetness. Predominant taste and odor are roasted malt and cocoa, with just a hint of a smoky coffee on the tongue. In total, particularly good porter."
"1666819395-421","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/","Everett","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22511/61062/","I received a can of this famous Porter from @Roy_Hobbs. Canned on 5/18/2021. Poured at 59° into a Willi Becher pint glass. It pours nearly black with very dark cola hues at the bottom of the glass when held to the light, with a large, fluffy, medium khaki-colored had and thick creamy lacing. It's a beautiful pour. Its fragrant nose features dark chocolate, cigar smoke, burnt coffee grounds and charred nuts. Wow, the taste is amazing! The initial chocolate malt sweetness is juxtaposed to acidic coffee (like it's from a Jersey diner), and bitter, earthy, nutty char. There is also strong tobacco. The blend and balance of flavors are exquisite. The mouth feel is rich and creamy - almost stout-like - with mild carbonation, and the 7% ABV seems perfect. Everett is highly drinkable but with excellent substance. This Porter is big and flavorful enough to pair with a fine meal of roasted red meat but you could easily drink a couple of pours casually. Everett's 100 Score is well-deserved. It's as good an American Porter as you'll have the great pleasure of drinking."

Appearance: Fairly cloudy amber color with generous-sized, thick, off-white head that slowly faded. Nothing to change here.



Smell: Moderate pine aromas and mild sweet fruity aromas. There is a bit of malty aromas also present.



Taste: Some sweetish malt notes first show up with some faint pine notes followed by a blast of hop bitterness. The beer has that sweet taste i typically get when IPAs/IIIPAs hit 10% or more ABV. The beer has a fairly sweet initial taste which dies off with some lingering bitter hop notes.



Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium-bodied with a fairly generous level of carbonation.

Appearance: It has a murky orange and gold body with some shadows that are just barely visible through it. The head is large, thick, and white. The head has a consistency of whipped cream with tapioca-like bubbles. It has very good retention and lacing.



Aroma: There is a light floral aroma with what smells like a dusty orange hard candy. As a whole the aroma is pretty muted but ok.



Taste: The flavor kind-of mimics the aroma; up front there is this orange flavor which is slightly floral. Towards the middle it picks up a light pith character and a bit of sweet malt flavor. It finishes slightly floral.



Mouthfeel: Carbonation feels great. The beer has a medium-light pithy hop bitterness. The body is on the lower edge of medium and smooth. Drinkability is high.



Overall: The flavors and aromas seem good but they are a bit muted in the beer. The can states that this is a ""ALC 10.5% BY VOL"" and it does a phenomenal job of hiding the high alcohol content. The beer mostly tastes like a somewhat sweet orange hard candy which is interesting. It isn't the best example of an Imperial IPA but it is still worth drinking due to the high drinkability.

Appearance: Pours a golden yellow orange color and fairly opaque with some visible sediment. Almost 3 fingers of snow-white foam. Great head retention and lacing down the glass once the foam dissipates. 

Smell: Initial notes of pine and citrus including grapefruit and orange rind. Lighter melon notes are also present with tangerine and apricot. Caramel and cracker malts with a prevailing bitterness. As the beer warms grassy and flowery notes become more prominent as the beer warms with an accompanying dankness. 



Taste: Holy Hops! Bitterness jumps out the glass and assaults the tastebuds. On the back end there is a pronounced overwhelming sweetness that really destroys the complexities of the malt backbone. Its hard to make anything out besides pine and grapefruit in the first few sips. More citrus notes arise after the first few sips including orange, mango, guava, melon, and lemon. Earthy grassy and floral notes also become more pronounced along with a present dankness. Maybe a subtle amount of cracker and caramel malts present, but the malt character is underwhelming. 



Feel: Medium carbonation with enhances the bitterness. Mouth feel is thick and usually I wouldn’t associate juiciness and bitterness, but this beer seems to have both. Definite alcohol warmness and a bit of a boozy aftertaste as the beer warms. 



Overall: This beer is solid, very complex and a lot of good flavors, but the sweetness is a bit overwhelming and doesn’t allow for other complexities to show.

375mL (bottled 7/12/2021) into a tulip. Pours a clear amber/mahogany with almost zero head, lazy carbonation rising from the bottom.



Aroma is acidic and vinous, tart and bright. Bready caramel malt, oak, apple cider vinegar. The yeast is clearly doing the heavy lifting here.



Taste is likewise sour and fruity with lots of red wine character. Oak barrel, wild yeast, clean malt, tannins. Complex and delicious. 



Mouthfeel is crisp and light, hiding the relatively high ABV. Finishes clean and dry, super refreshing. 



Overall an excellent, well constructed wild/sour ale. Seems pretty straightforward but it’s one of those beers that is deceptively simple. Clearly a great deal of skill and artistry went into producing this. It’s reputation is well deserved.

O: So this is my first time with any of the RR sours. Right away, I don't see too much as to why this is so special or a top 250 beer. I've had many sours and Cab-aged sours that are similar to this. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine beer. Very complex and deep and the barrel is done really nice. I can be maybe this being very pioneering back in the day, so maybe it's reputation precedes it. Just don't think in 2022 this can hold a candle to some of the wild ales from HF or SARA or even Bellwoods.

I’m back with my next Russian River Wild. I had Temptation last week, and while I thought it was pretty good, it didn’t completely wow me. This one sounds like it’ll be more up my alley anyhow, so I have higher hopes here. This one currently sits at the 15th highest rated Wild Ale and 209th highest rated beer overall on BA. Let’s pop the cork and get to it



Pours a murky light brown with a finger of off white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing



Perhaps unsurprisingly, this gives off a huge Flanders Red/Brown vibe in the nose, and it’s quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of tart cherry, black currant, brown bread, red wine vinegar, sharp oak, toffee, raisin, and light leather



Oh man, this is rather unique in taste. It's so easy to lean too far into either funk or fruit with the style, but this one strikes an incredible balance and provides a dark wine character which hardly ever comes through this much. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black currant, buttery oak, tobacco, leather, light lemon zest, red wine vinegar, and a touch of bready malt. The swallow brings notes of old leather, black currant, tobacco, brown bread, tart cherry, black pepper, red wine vinegar, toffee, sharp oak, and light vanilla



A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet gentle beer. Finishes a bit sticky but dries over time with a wonderful complexity. Drinks well under 10%



Well this was just awesome. I can see why this is considered a classic. I could have a cellar full of this and be happy. Cheers yall"

Consecration

Russian River Brewing

Date: 05 November 2020

Another sour today, but this one is aged in wine barrels with currants. Pulling the cork carefully, then a loud pop, followed by mist. The beer is 48 degrees, and I served it my Stone RIS tulip. The pour created a fizzy and airy off-white head with poor retention. No lacing on the glass after the quick dissipation. The color is a combination between maroon and mahogany with brownish hues. This beer is translucent, with a few carbonation bubbles present. 



The aromas in the beer are vinous, fruity, sour apples, oaky, funkiness, earthy, horse blankets, biscuit, bready, and a slight hint of pharmaceutical. 



The flavors are oaky, earthy, funky, lightly toasted malt, brett, sour apple vinegar, bready, a hint of floral esters, vinous, stone fruit, tart cherries, and danky. 



The mouthfeel is dry, tannic, and puckering



The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonation, and lingering finish. 



This sour is wonderful all the flavors in the beer create this harmonious blend of flavors. The wine barrel aging gave the beer depth and complexity. Stellar beer!"

Bottle Number 239. 750 ml. 1 Pint, 9.4 fluid ounces. Alc. 10% by Volume. Aged in bourbon barrels. Brewed and bottled by Lift Bridge Brewing Company in Stillwater, MN, USA. ""The Cold War is over. Serve at 55-60. Degrees. (I still don't know the key for that one.) I will skip the the gobbledygook until later.



(Note: this is one of those very rare occasions when I don't have a photo of the beer I consumed to go along with the notes. I plugged in the iPod touch that use to take them and found nothing. How is this possible? It's part of my regular routine, I never forget to take the pictures. Could I have accidentally deleted them somehow? That's even less likely. Perhaps I was just so excited to drink the beer that I forgot to take that essential early step in my ritual. So, once I realized there were no photos, I fished the empty bottle out of the recycling, and posed it next to the as yet un-washed glass I drank it from. That's not even the true beer in there, I followed Silhouette with another bottle.





I bought this two weeks ago at the brewery. Wish I had another to save and age and savor in the future, but this is the one, and I'm drinking it now. (I'd actually never even heard of this beer, must have been sleeping or something when it was released last year.)





Solid blackness in this one (the darkest beer I've had from this brewery), with a rich, roast tan head that starts big, slims down and stays awhile.



Aroma leaps out and spills the bourbon all over the place. Additional notes of charcoal, molasses, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, …vanilla. Always vanilla. And I like it.



Taste: Ah, mmm, and yeah, huh. Deepness and richness in abundance. This has got everything it needs and it lasts and lasts. Immensely indulgent. Chocolate and espresso and everything dark and deep and delicious. MMM, I'll say it again. And what else? Licorice. We call it anise sometimes. And all those other things.



It's a thing of hugeness and a richness and wonderfully rewarding to the drinker. this is all relative. I am loving this and this is not a chore at all, it is a delight. If you want to read about a chore, check my review of Stone's Crime and Punishment. Yikes, talk about trial and error!



Hey, let's read the gobbledygook. ""Silhouette is as deep and dark as the Northern woods. It's brewed in the style of an Imperial Stout. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, molasses and prune meld with a unique dark roasted character. . The beer is complex, rich and full bodied. It's wild spirit will warm the senses, illuminate the soul, and grow into a traditional favorite…no matter what season."""

I walked on by this beer many times in the store because I considered it to be overpriced (yeah, I know... it's a ""99 World-Class"" here, but we're suckers for a BA Imperial stout...).



Anyhow, in a weak moment, I did order one from my favorite curb-side pickup store a while back, and it sat in my 'fridge, and sat, until I finally moved it to the cellar to make room for other beers. 



It's back in the refrigerator for Cellaruary.



So, today is the day. I won't be able to compare it to the beer fresh, though, since this is my first tasting of this beer.



Taken from a ~42° refrigerator and allowed to warm for 30 minutes or so unopened. Drinking started at mid-50°'s (a guess).



Opaque black topped by a ½ inch creamy-appearing dark tan head with short retention. Little visible carbonation and what lacing does appear with a tip of the glass quickly slides back down into the tan ring. The ring eventually disappears completely, leaving a still surface.



Very strong aroma. Bourbon first, then barrel. Molasses. Slight hint of vanilla.



Rich flavor, mirroring the aroma. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, sweet molasses. Adding to the party is roasted malts and dark fruits. Toward the finish and into the aftertaste, dark chocolate appears along with the alcohol, slightly warming my mouth in the after. The finish is sweet vanilla and dark chocolate.



The body is substantial, approaching viscous (but not quite getting there).



Overall, this BA stout is excellent, indeed. A rich aroma and flavor, a substantial body, lots of bourbon and barrel without overpowering the underlying Imperial stout flavors, a sweet, but controlled sweetness, finish. It's not a dessert beer, but an excellent evening sipping beer. If I'm feeling like splurging, I may actually buy it again!"

Corona Day #65



Price: $19.99 Lowry Hill Liquor in Minneapolis

Current Rank: #184 on Beer Advocate



Appearance: 4 - extremely black, and a bit thin. Head fizzled away immediately.



Nose: 5 - nearly all sweet barrel. Good!



Taste: 5 - basically all barrel. Fruitier than some other big stouts for sure. Reminds me a little of Surly Darkness, which can almost pass for a quad.



Mouth: 4 - thick and sticky, but quite flat. Glides down the throat smoothly, but I prefer more carbonation.



Overall: 5 - waited years to finally try this one. Will be sure to hunt it down again next time I'm in that part of the country.

In this style it is so hard to hide the alcohol content. Prairie does this well. Slight chili taste in the end keeps it from tasting too sweet. Also stands apart because of the carbonation.

Tastes great. The chocolate and vanilla play nice and Satan sends a small heat spear on the tongue and back of the throat at the finish. Balanced rolling flavor profile.

Surprising medium size dark tan/brown head with, what I would consider, a very long lasting head for a 13% abv beer. Aroma and taste have it all for a stout. Rich malty presence, strong coffee and chocolate presence, a little vanilla (good for me since I don't like prominent vanilla in my stouts and porters). I may have picked up some mild chili peppers in the first taste, but not after that. Mouthfeel is rich and fairly smooth, but with a little alcohol ""bite"" as befits the high octane.

Pours a deep, jet-purple body with an airy half-finger of extra-pale mauve head, retreating quickly to a few paper-thin, spotty islands of cap, a sizeable, bubbly collar, and virtually no lacing beyond an occasional splotching isolated at various points around the glass.



Aroma shows fresh blackberry pits engaging with an increasingly rounded lactic funk, sharpwning over time while simultaneously embracing jammy blackberry and a deepening sweetness as the beer warms; old leather and wet stone peak over the middle into fresher oak and some grape-like tannins to close.



Taste ooens with suggestions of blackberry quijcly overtaken by lactic funk and a splintery oak profile; hints of dried peppercorn pair with a sturdy tannic structure into a mid-palate of barnyard funk and lemon zest, while tones of blackberry pits, lactic funk, and a brief burst of red berries mark the finish.



Mouthfeel brings a medium-light body with a fine, moderate-mild carbonation; a huge acidity is sharp and biting over the mid-palate, acetic and puckering though crisp into back end; a brief juiciness dries steadily with slight tannic textures on the finish.



Increasingly palatable as it warms, an overwhelming acidity remains dominant, relegating the blackberry to an underdeveloped background while largely glossing over the nuance of the funk; this wild ale is clearly designed competently and shows sporadic sparks of genuine depth, but a relentless imbalance ultimately takes away from the overall product."
"1666819406-476","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/","Thicket","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/32319/154421/","Batch 2 - 375ml bottle - poured into a zin stem at 45°F.



Pours a deep blackberry purple - foggy anf crimson when held to the light, with a lasting sudsy pinkish collar. The occasional rising bubble can be seen. Not as saturated, but quite similar to a merlot in appearance. 



Nose: Really wonderful blackberry presence here. That classic, instantly recognisable Side Project grist and culture character forms a simple foundation, with some toasty grain, bright acidity, and white oak, with subtle threads of hay, wheat, dusty leather, stone, petrichor, wet leaves, and lemon. The fruit is fresh, vibrant, and seedy, with an underlying jammy element. Reserved, but elegant. 



Palate: Thicket greets the palate with a sharp zing of acidity, with a ton of lacto-driven lemon juice pucker, and a bit of acetic bite following. Like many fruited Side Project wilds, there's an underlying sweetness that seems like it's from both the malt as well as some fructose. The sweetness tuns parallel to, but beneath the sourness, taming it a bit. The blackberry character is unmistakable, buy leans towards the dry, seedy, unripe, tart end of the spectrum, rather than juicy or saturated. The acidity is aggressive, and thankfully, burns fast and bright, settling down quickly, and revealing some grains and a bit of oak. Some ripe berry pokes through, along with some wine-soaked oak, finishing quick, clean, and dry. 



Mouthfeel/Body: Thicket is medium-light in body, wispy, fluid, and crisp. Puckering acidity up front causes some mouthwatering. Effervescence is fine, lively, amd sparkly. The finish is dry, with some very subtle oak tannins. 



Overall: This is one of those wild ales that could have been stellar if it wasn't so acidic. The reviews are polarising - some saying it's jammy, others, that it's crazy sour. As it warms, some ripe berry sweetness does begin to emerge, which helps a lot, and it does become enjoyable, but the aggressive acidity holds it back and stifles the complexity. It's certainly fruit-forward, and very much Side Project, but it isn't the most balanced or complex offering. This one is good, but not amazing."

Taste - In the profile, coffee led the way. Cinnamon came in second place, and it was not overdone but gave a nice element of spice. I struggle to find a vanilla notes and the barrel profile was mild. The coffee and cinnamon carried to the finish. 



Mouthfeel - The beer had some viscosity, allowing the main profile to linger. 



Overall - This one was a bit of a letdown for me."

Nose is extremely funky and expressive with elements of dried and wet hay, fresh cut crash, menthol, wood chips, pine, and sap. The aroma continually evolves and builds on itself throughout the course of the drink. Taste follows with an equal complexity and expresses many of those notes from the nose. There's a deep earthiness that underlies it as well, evocative at one moment of the smells of a forest floor or the flavor of a cave aged cheese the next.

Clear, medium gold colored body. One finger of white head sticks around as rising bubbles replenish. Slight strings of lacing.

Aroma is a complexity of funk, fruit and oak. The funk is musty and hay-like, the fruit is remindful of green apples, and the oak adds to both the slight sweetness and the tannins.

Taste is also complex, and sour in tone. The mustiness comes through in the funk notes, and the fruit has green apples that add to the sour tone. Big oak underlay. Rather quick to disperse and dry. The fruit funk lingers.

Mouth feel is light and substantial at the same time. Bubbly, and high in carbonation.

Excellent balance in its blending, and a pleasure to sip."

Lost my review three damn times due to page crashing. Now this will be a short review for a phenomenal tasting, which is annoying. 



Pours a honeyed golden orange. No real head to speak of, but a nice white ring surrounds the glass.



Complex nose that you need to smell yourself to truly experience it. Fruit notes of green apples, pears. Funky notes of general barnyard stuff, hay, some musty notes in there as well. Somewhat of a vinous smell, generic dark wine grapes here. Some wooden and oaky aromas. The smell is not an unrestrained Brett/super barnyard funk that smells like a horses barn that hasn’t been cleaned and smells like crap, and it’s not sour vinegar-y either. It’s even mildly sweet. 



Taste of apricots on the sip that morph into a green apple flavour. Some dried lemon and tangerine peel notes here, I think it’s the drying effect on your palate that give me that impression. Ever spritz a citrus peel and lick the peel itself? That kind of oily flavour is here, but it’s miles more gentle. A little bit of wheaty notes here as well, like some damp, whole wheat bread made with sprouted grains or something. Vinous character at times, like generic white wine grapes. It sort of dances between a lot of different flavours, and yet all of them meld together on each sip. It’s more like, on a particular sip a certain dancer does their solo before blending back in. It’s pretty remarkable all things considered. Some gentle leather like flavours that are sometimes accompanied by… a mild smoke flavour? I might just be shooting blanks here, but it feels like it. There is not, well… I don’t think it’s a savoury character to this. But there is this kind of umami flavour to it. Sort of like the character of blue cheese or yogurt, that sort of body. It’s not oily, particularly, because the sourness makes it more tart than anything. It’s really hard to nail down this character, especially as it warms and it comes out even more. Thankfully… I have another in the cellar!



Definitely sour, but not a puckering sour. There is even a mild sweetness. It finishes pretty dry, and surprisingly, finishes quite clean as well. No lingering sourness on the palate. Maybe some very mild fruits and the slightest hint of sweetness, which is really unique from a lot of sour beers I’ve tried. Good carbonation that creates a smooth sip, the carbonation is not particularly biting. Medium bodied.



This is my first real Geuze. I’ve had plenty of sours, but not a Geuze as of yet. And I’ve had plenty of terrible farmyard funky sour vinegar bombs that taste like they added 10 gallons of brettanomyces. This is not that. This is balanced, restrained and yet complex. For what the style is, it feels like an absolute benchmark. I am by no means an expert in this arena, but this is quite an experience for any beer drinker. My bottle was bottled early 2018. Which made this about 4 years old when I drank it. I have a second one I plan to age for another 4 years or so! Can’t wait to revisit it! To tide me over until then, I have many other 3 Fonteinen beers to try… the framboise may be next!"

S: musty earth/wood, bright acidity, mild citrus, wood, grain, and apple notes. 

T: follows the nose with musty/damp flavors and soft citrus, with the addition of darker grain/dark bread flavors. I get a touch of dark fruit followed by a cider-like note in the finish and apple skins in the aftertaste. There’s a earthy spice throughout along with a lingering funk to the aftertaste. 

M: frothy, creamy carbonation complimented by acidity that is sharp but quick. Medium body with a little chew to it. Not bone dry or thin. Acidity lingers but this drinks well. But if you want a few of the last sharp corners rounded off, give this a few more years of age. This is still pretty bright for 5 years.

Very thin, fleeting off-white head appears as the beer is poured, but dissipates almost instantly. The aroma on this is very complex - there is a moderate funkiness on the nose that is immediately noticeable. Notes of tart green apple, white grapes, oak, dirty laundry, and a zippy lemon character.



The taste leans into the funk without as much of the tartness. There are notes of green apples, apple, lemon, some bleu cheese notes, strong oak with some mellow white grapes, wet blanket funkiness and some dry tannic notes. I feel like I get something else every time I take a drink of this beer. At times its funkier, and times it more fruity and tart, then it is drier and leans into that chardonnay like character. The complexity of this is amazingly balanced by a drinkability I have rarely found in these geuzes. I could actually envision drinking this all afternoon rather than just a single glass - although my heartburn would undoubtedly make me regret that. Still, this is a beautiful beer - complex, yet approachable.



The feel is medium bodied with bright, vibrant carbonation. The tartness in this dances up to the point of being puckering without ever actually reaching that point. It is definitely a drier beer especially on the back end into the finish.

It pours a viscous black color in the glass with a mocha-colored head. When poured cold, the flavor profile leads with chocolate wafer cookies, bourbon-vanilla heat, and rich dark chocolate. As it warms, the true complexity emerges. We taste and smell bourbon chocolate chip cookie dough, bourbon vanilla ice cream, tootsie rolls, and smooth chocolate syrup.



The vanilla addition serves to soften the bourbon and chocolate character of the base beer making the whole presentation more confectionary and decadent like chocolate vanilla syrup.



Appearance: 4 - definitely black, but poured a bit thin. Not much head.



Nose: 5 - oh my. No explosion in the nose, just smells very well blended and not too sweet.

Served in a Tree House teku



Viscous, complete pitch black appearance. The dense, oily looking body was capped by a small film of coffee colored bubbles that quickly dissolved. A thin, lasting ringlet encircled the liquid.



The aroma was a bit underwhelming initially but improved dramatically after a few minutes. Fresh vanilla bean came through strong. Good amount of sweet, sticky caramel and toffee pudding notes too. Moderate bourbon presence. As the beer warmed, both the bourbon and the vanilla really intensified. Dark fruits were also apparent.



The flavor profile was just as impressive as the aroma. Super rich, malty and robust. Nice roasted and caramel malt presence on the front end. Loads of fresh vanilla bean too. Moderately sweet. Dark fruits were detectable in the center. Bit of chocolate fudge as well. Bourbon barrel notes appeared as the beer moved along the palate and intensified on the finish. More lingering boozy bourbon, vanilla and sweetness after the swallow.



Outstanding mouthfeel. Rich, creamy and full bodied for the style. Super oily and dense on the palate. The liquid contained a finely bubbled, moderate effervescence that turned super frothy and smooth. After a few sips, the beer deposited a sticky film on my lips.



Tree House’s Blend Two was a big disappointment, but Vanilla Bean Truth definitely lived up to the hype. The fresh vanilla bean notes were intense but not overwhelming, and the bourbon presence was punchy though not overly hot or boozy.

Gorgeous pour. Body traps light. Completely dark. Lovely finger of soft dark brown foam. Quite the beaut.



Nose has lovely rich velvety espresso with vanilla and milk chocolate and sure enough there's a hint of raspberries layered in there as well. Inviting.



The berries are much more prevalent here, beginning at the first sip. It starts off as just kind of a general berry/fruit sweetness that builds alongside the other components I will get to in a moment to reveal a jammy decidedly raspberry note. We'll come back to this later. The build alongside this has silky espresso and dark chocolate as well as a hint of vanilla and spice and oak from the barrel. This brings us back to the raspberry. You know how raspberries are actually kind of tart alongside their juicy sweetness? It's one of the great things about them, is they offer a balance and a range of experience, and that presents here. The finish has some bitter from the coffee, and a bit of pucker that feels like the raspberry tartness joining the oakiness of the barrels and a bit of alcohol astringency (that works well in this situation to accentuate the other flavours listed there) to give it a little 'ooh!' to the finish. Really enjoyable.



Body is velvety smoothe, and that tart finish I descibe above fades to leave behind some of the dark chocolate bitterness and a slight reminder of the alcohol contained therein. Would not descibe it as hot, but it isn't shy about it's double digit ABV.



I'm really enjoying this. Raspberry and chocolate are such a natural seeming pairing, but I feel like I still don't see it quite as often as I'd expect, in beer. I think it really really works well here, and am grateful to have had the opportunity to try it. Thanks Frank!"

L: jet black, tan cola half finger head that goes away after a minute.



S: decadent chocolate, a hint of caramel/toffee/hazelnut, a hint of ethyl that mellows as it warms, as well as a little maple syrup. Not quite like walking into a fudge shop but surprisingly close.



T: a lot of decadent bittersweet chocolate with even more character from the barrels. Finishes with a zing of those caramel/maple syrup type flavors.



F: medium body, smooth, coats the tongue, mild carbonation. Would prefer it to be a bit thicker but it’s good.

And contrary to some comments made by others, I found the stout thick, like a few stouts that have been condensed. As for price, I've become more accepting. I would not be willing to pay $8 for a 6 oz pour at a bar (unless I was already drunk), but paying $5 or $6 per 12 oz bottle seems an acceptable transaction.

I really grew to appreciate this one the more it warmed and opened up. It's a big sweet dessert stout, the first few sips make that very clear, and they absolutely nailed the fudge factor. It's also surprisingly easy to drink for something so big and sweet, which I came to realize is due to the solid foundation of coffee that kept peeking out more and more as my glass emptied.

O: My first SARA beer here, very lucky to grab this from SF on a trip this past April. Been hearing a lot of great things about them for years. Really digging this. Very clean, light, complex. Just a slight funk, not overly tart. Great carbonation and mouthfeel. Don't have much to compare it to from the brewery, but as far as saisons and wild ales go, this is certainly top notch.

This is honestly one of the uglier lambics that I have cast my eyes on. Aroma is quite fantastic, a combination of raspberry jam with the slight mustiness of a kriek. It's got jammy raspberry with some overt tartness. There's also an underpinning of chamomile. They say don't meet your heroes and often times with beer, it feels like you are set up for disappointment when you have a highly sought after and/or highly regarded beer. This is a true icon of the lambic game and rightfully so."

Ruby red in the glass with a small fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Aromas are balanced between raspberry and cherry pie filling, with a nice lemony acidity from the base lambic.

Beautiful strawberry color in the glass, completely transparent if decanted - darker and murkier with the yeast, however, nearly completely opaque. I prefer my yeast be included in my Belgians (for health, of course), but I'm not holding that against the appearance score. Pale pink fizzy head, brief lived, leaving the body completely still.



Extraordinary nose: tart and fruity, but equally funky, earthy, and sharp. Earthy, dirty, mushroom-like funk; raspberry and cherry; oak and must; a great example of the oft-mocked ""horse blanket.""



The palate has less earthy funk, but it's still there, especially on the back half. Up front, it's a blend of the sharp tartness of the berries and a light white wine vinegar-like sourness. Cherry skins and raspberry on the back third and finish.



Strongly sour, more in line with many American takes on sours and wild ales than most Belgian Lambics, owing at least in part to the sharpness of the berries. Mouth puckering; lingering sourness about the gums. Swishing, swirling, and chewing is almost dangerous. There's no vinegar burn, however.



This is world class, but if more of the funkiness translated to the palate and cut through the sourness, it would be among the best beers I've ever had. As it is, it's easily one of the best fruited Lambics in the world, different in character from Cantillon, but just as good. Perhaps the funk becomes more pronounced with age."

So excited to finally try this bottle that I got in a trade from Belgium. We're finally seeing a bit more 3 Fonteinen in Chicago with them dropping Intense Red and Homage in mass recently. It's a very pretty lambic. A medium hued peach in color with nice carbonation and lacing that stays around. I don't get as much off the nose as I would like while it's cold but the flavors jump out more on the tongue thankfully. As it warmed the lambic funk started to come through. There's so much happening flavor wise here. Tartness is medium to medium high. I wish there were a bit more funk but it's present. It recognizable as a 3 Fonteinen beer immediately to me.

Pours a golden-copper with notable floaties and particles suspended in the beer. Head is a finger of white foam. Aroma is lemongrass, herbal, stone, and apricot. Apricot isn't forward, molding into the surroundings for a subtle twist of sweetness. Nose has a light tanginess to it, but it's faint. Flavor profile is apricot forward, which lays on top of herbal, lemongrass, and stone. Finish is notably tangy and funky, much more so than the nose.

Can, thanks to DC, to tulip glass. 





LOOK: murky hazy yellow, beautiful cream colored head with excellent retention. Beautiful.

AROMA: grapefruit, vegetable, cantaloupe, pineapple. A little light. 

TASTE: pine resin, general citrus tries to fend of the pine but can't quite do it. Some light touches of pepper, spice, melon. Pine dominates upfront and in the finish with a temporary splish of citrus in the middle.



FEEL: medium body, good carbonation, touch of astringency. 





Well crafted, just too bitter for my tastes.

Nose is sweet peach, citrus, grass, melon and grapefruit. Melons along the lines of honeydew and cantaloupe. Very nice cornucopia of fruits. Nice sweetness with a good balance of grassy hop presence. 



Taste is similar. Peach, citrus, and melon, and a relatively strong weed dankness that wasn't as present on the nose. Also it could just be a phantom effect but I get brief moments of raspberry. Medium bitterness, almost reaching something on the higher side of what you'd expect on a NEIPA. mild to medium hop burn as you drink, building on the back of the throat. Very mild cracker malt backbone. Barely shows up and is overwhelmed by the fruit, weed, and grass presence. 



Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied for a NEIPA. Mild carbonation. The hop bitterness and alcohol level, makes this brew feel a little more harsh and bubbly than it actually is.



Overall an enjoyable NEIPA. This one is a big boy. Juicy, sweet, and dank. I personally preferred Cutting Tiles, but there is still many Trillium IPAs to try and I look forward to future entries into this brewery."

Pours an opaque pale orange/yellow color (like white grapefruit juice) with a pretty aggressive head with decent retention. Scents of sweet tropical punch and candy. I’ve been on a hazy DIPA kick this summer, so a lot of them blend together but this one definitely has some unique notes coming through. The description by Trillium says pink starburst, and I’m definitely getting some of that- really candy like fruity flavor. I’m also getting some bitter citrus and sweet tropical fruits. Lingering bitterness from hop oils on the palate. I have to say this one sneaks up on you at 9+% because you don’t even notice it. So many beers at that level have a very obvious alcohol burn and taste but this one is totally smooth for that ABV. My first time trying heavy mettle (I’ve had one in the alloy series and death mettle) and I think this one is my fav of the bunch. May not be your bag if you don’t like the sweetness that this recipe invokes, but I’m definitely digging it."

Vintage 2021



A: Pours midnight black and somewhat viscous in appearance. Immensely dark head of 1plus fingers width dissipates at a moderate rate. Leaves only a few patches of lacing. 4.75



S: Aroma is, my god. Massive cinnamon, big chocolate, vinous dark fruits, luscious bourbon, capsaicin peppery heat, red wine. Barrel notes are moderate in strength and compliment the beer wonderfully. Some base beer notes primarily roasted malt. Fire roasted marshmallows rounds it out. Goodness gracious. 4.75



T: Taste is also excellent, albeit perhaps a bit less voluptuous. I again get huge vinous and red wine notes up front, hell is actually tastes like it’s red wine barrel

aged. Next comes the cinnamon and rich, fine high cocoa content dark chocolate. On the finish there is roasted malt, charred oaky bourbon notes, some balancing bitterness. This is just wave after wave of flavors and it’s quite frankly just impressive. 4.75



M/D: Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick. ABV is not noticeable which is impressive. Drinkability, however, is quite limited. The combination of the heavy/thick feel and adjunct laden flavor profile make 500mL of this feel like 3 gallons (and this is coming from someone who drinks Bourbon County all the time and even old school 750mL Black Tuesdays without any trouble). 4



O: Overall, this is quite the beer. Normally beers this adjunct heavy can be not really my thing, but this one just pulls it off wonderfully. Probably more appropriate as an 8oz pour as opposed to a 500mL solo bottle, but still, well done Cigar City, well done. 4.5"

Loved this beer originally two weeks ago, but these had on the best by date aren't jumping out at me quite as much. I actually do not think it's because of age, just my palate being a little different when I did this review.



That aside, this is still a very good IPA, especially if I am patient enough to let it warm to the proper temperature from my cold fridge. The look is a quite highly hazed, near but not 100% opaque. As with many HF beers, the head and lacing are pretty strong.



Nose is a mix of tangerine, grapefruit, and some form of sweet fruit - I want to say a little pineapple. There's a light herbal note that comes somewhat as a muted mint to me, but is definitively a foreshadowing of some form of bitterness in the taste.



Medium heft, maybe a little less, with a prickly carbonation biting through the softer edges. More citrus rind and fruit - tangerine, orange, and some sweet ruby grapefruit, with a little huskiness from the barley and/or other grains. Not really any of the tropical fruit accent from the nose. The back end is bitter, but it has an interesting sheen of maltiness to it. Bittersweet leaning heavily on the first part, the latter keeps things from getting out of hand. As expected, a well constructed brew that brings both malt and hop to the experience."

Wonderful passionfruit and orange hop flavors on the nose. The palate follows through with plenty of citrus and tropical hop flavors. A very refined, well-crafted beer where everything just works."
"1666819449-634","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/","Susan","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22511/86487/","Pours a bright, completely opaque, orange color. Thick, sudsy off white head forms, then dissipates leaving a quarter inch of foam in the glass along with plenty of sticky lacing. Aroma has notes of tangerine, orange marmalade, grass, dried vegetation and a slight woody character to it.



Taste follows the nose with notes of citrus, orange, orange marmalade, and peach giving way to a grassy, vegetal, woody hop character on the back end. Clearly the Riwaka are coming through on the back end. Moderately bitter, mildly sweet, completely delicious. Feel is moderately bodied, smooth, and pretty easy drinking. Moderate carbonation.



This is a really nice IPA from Hill Farmstead - they get so much out of the hops both in the aroma and taste, its impressive."

Burned orange in color, but what really stands out is the gorgeous head. Dense, foamy & long lasting with extensive lacing. Aroma has lots of citrus & tropical notes, with orange being what jumps out at me the most. 



Taste has more of the tropical / citrus notes with the hops working well together. The orange detected on the nose is not present on the tongue, although some hints of grapefruit do come through. Amazingly full mouthfeel. Good beer."

Smell: There are both grassy and floral tones here, with stone fruit and lemon in the mix



Taste: The flavors here are subtle but bring an interesting spectrum; stone fruit and passion fruit are featured, with a lemon aspect; the bitterness builds nicely but is held in check so that it doesn't overwhelm



Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation



Overall: A very nice IPA but the progeny has boosted this to the top of the IPA charts; not saying it doesn't belong there but I wonder whether the subtlety would shine as much in a blind tasting"

L: beautiful, rich golden maize color with a 3/4"" of thick head that dissipated after a few minutes. Somewhat opaque, owing to the unfiltered packaging.

S: some clean, piney wafts along with a noseful of citrus and sugary-sweet hops (maybe the Riwaka?). Very appealing.

T: bright citrus scent on the nose makes its way down but is quickly subdued by dank and slightly bitter (WA state?) hops that make for a really interesting APA. 

F: mild carbonation, very quaffable. Hop bitterness lingers nicely. 

O: a near-perfect rating for good reason; this is a great take on a classic variety that has been overshadowed by the new shiny toy (NE/hazy IPAs). Fantastic beer."

Aroma is pure sweetened coconut.. and honestly, I am struggling to find anything else. It’s quite overpowering, and while the aroma is very nice, I’m missing the barrel and the coffee to balance it all out.



Oh my god, so much coconut. Sticky, milk chocolate covered coconut candy, coagulated coconut oil, oaky bourbon, espresso brownie batter. It’s a good thing it’s a 12 oz can. Any more and it would be tough to finish. As it warms, it becomes very sweet, and syrupy. Begging for more barrel, but it just barely squeaks through.



Don’t get me wrong, it’s very good, but it’s the definition of “pastry stout.” Pushing the limits of sweet ingredients that you can hardly recognize that it’s beer anymore. A touch of restraint or a tweak in ratios would have done wonders for the beer."

The flavors are also distinct and intense- coconut, coffee, bourbon, chocolate, malt, some vanilla as it warms. Smooth, an excellent full body, appropriately carbonated.

The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick and opaque with a thin khaki head, loose bubbles and no retention nor lacing.

The flavors are nice, lots of rich chocolate, nice coffee that offers a bit of acidity and fruitiness that draws out some more darker stone fruits. The barrel has a lot of heat, lots of char but offers some toasted coconut, toffee and caramel forward bourbon while being dominated at the finish by alcohol heat. The mouthfeel is good, coating and thick, heavy body with a warm and smooth finish.



Verdict: A nice Benthic variant, but definitely the booziest Benthic I've come across. The balance starts off well but suffers a bit from the heat of this beer and the coffee is the element that fails to come across the most."

Pours a glossy, motor-oil black body topped with a barely-formed, mocha head, quickly fizzling to a spotty array of paper-thin islands of cap, expansive, creamy collar, and the occasional strand of short-lived, webby lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.



Aroma expresses dulled notes of brownie batter cut with boggy ethanol as a slight black raspberry accents upfront; dark chocolate, caramel, and touches of pipe tobacco develop sparingly against a core focused intently on rawer bourbon tones and distinctly wet oak barrel; some molasses and burnt brown sugar factor in toward the back end.



Taste bursts intently with waves of silky drinking chocolate, refined and creamy while leveled with a slight nuttiness; molasses progresses as the bourbon character deepens, forming notes of caramel brittle, burnt marshmallow, and brown sugar over the mid-palate as coffee bean meets bittersweet, malty char on the back end; a slightly smoky, ashy char finishes.



Mouthfeel brings put a fluid medium body elevated with a timely, fluffy burst of carbonation rounding into a silky grit over the mid-palate; heavy roast expands on the back end to counterbalance a growing bitterness with ample char, while a slightly sticky character gently coats the palate into an otherwise moderately dry finish.



From initial impressions of muddled heat and subdued malts, a level of forward, confident brilliance is expressed in equal parts sweetness and roast; the final product is an amazing flow of enveloping character, seemingly unending in its influx of intrigue and detail despite any apparent shortcomings."

Pours a seemingly fluid deep midnight black. A very minimal dark mocha head recedes fast leaving a persistent bubbly collar. The beer clings to glass, draping down and staining it brown. Oil spill. 



Nose: Aroma opens very strong and saturated. Notes of bourbon-soaked brown sugar, drippy molasses, burned soft caramel, English toffee, demerera sugar, encapsulated by very heavily charred oak. The roast lends some milk chocolate, cacao nib, and a deep burnish character. Some bramble dark fruit and current highlight brightness, with ethanol fumes are quite apparent, and paired with this densely musty, sopping oak character, detracts from the otherwise rich depth. 



Palate: Waves of rich, silken, malt-driven fudgy roast, caramel, toffee, cacao nib, burned brown sugar, and molasses lend an initial sweetness that is rich and decadent, before an almost unrealistic degree of flame-charred, bourbon-soaked oak barrel comes in and cuts it down quickly. Big burly bourbon notes, with toffee, coconut, pipe tobacco, vanilla caviar, and an almost bark-like tannin structure. The barrel and roast overtake the sweetness, and pair together for an exquisitely lengthy finish.



Mouthfeel/Body: Shying away from the thick, vicious, chewy theme, Midnight Still manages to deliver all the fudgy richness from the malt, with the sweetness fading by the finish, and replaced by dense, oily barrel. A nice fluidity allows it to remain drinkable, without ever approaching cloying, surrounded by a soft, fluffy carbonation. 



Overall: There's so much going on here that seems so unique to this beer. This is not a replica of another - it is not a waxed Bourbon County. This is a beautifully seamless execution of balance between malt complexity and full-on bourbon barrel assault, with the only real thing dragging it down is the ethanol and musty earthiness in the aroma. This is one for the books."

Has the requisite 'used motor oil' kind of pour in viscosity and appearance. Aroma went hard on the bourbon and ashtray. Behind that you had some chocolate like fudge notes and an even smaller vanilla quotient. 



Once again, bourbon dominates the taste, but it manages to push one of the biggest bourbon portfolio's without being too boozy or by eliminating all other beer aspects. As if KBS was less coffee and chocolate but more bourbon. Drinks smooth while still being able to drop some smoke and ash notes the whole time. Hint of dark fruit creeps in as it warmed up on the back 9. 



I don't necessarily think this is better than the all time classics of barrel aging (KBS, Eclipse, BCS, CW), but it can definitely hang with them. Would be interesting to see what the score for this would be if it were a lot easier to acquire, I imagine a little bit less, but not significantly. It is top notch."

A- Oil black pour from the waxed bottle into a snifter. A small nutty brown foam layer appears on top of the beer with decent retention leaving spotty lace.



S- Bang on balance of roast bittersweet stout and decadent sticky, aged distillery basement and oak bourbon barrels. The Bourbon alone is unreal, peppery spicy sticky booze and fruit notes. Fudge and rich cocoa balanced perfectly by boozy whiskey. Roast barley. Hints of vanilla. Truly Bourbon mastery.



T- No arguing that the Bourbon is the star of the show but there is enough malt character to balance to near perfection. Bitter roast barley and fruity dark chocolate bars, french roast coffee beans, pepper, vanilla hints, brownies, boozy edge, caramel, oak wood degradation and nuttiness. Again it tastes like Buffalo Trace's sticky sweet bourbon barrel house. Strong oak bourbon malts but all pretty balanced, just HUGE.



MF- Thick and slick oily monster. The booze tames the hefty body quite a bit finding a nice middle ground. Slightly creamy and chewy. Ends warm.



The Bourbon barrel character in this beer is basically unmatched from what I have come across in the last ten years. A great surprise to be able to drink this brew in Maine and one of the best beers I have had in quite some time. Hopefully can visit this brewery again some day."

First taste was earthy and very bitter, but that seemed an anomaly after a few more of them. It remained a bitter beer, but some balance returned. After some sips, the earthy to dirty nature wasn’t completely shook and firmed the base.

As the sweetness is quickly chased away by the roast and booze, the flavors of espresso sets in with baker's chocolate, roasted walnut and campfire to follow.

Pours an ink-black body capped with around a finger of creamy, pale mocha foam; decent head retention yields a few spotty, paper-thin islands of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a minimal amount of spotty lacing holding to the walls of the glass.



Aroma opens with charry roast sporting a boozy cherry essence before a burly bourbon character takes over; burnt vanilla bean offers a slight bittersweetness over the middle, while the back end of the bouquet highlights increasingly defined notes of dark chocolate, Raisinets, and suggestions of cherry liqueur.



Taste brings forth a vivid expression of sweet, bourbon-imbued malts with some savory umami aspects; melted marshmallow, chocolate soft serve ice cream, with toasty malt tones interspersed between; sweet pipe tobacco and baked cacao over the mid-palate feed into darker brownie crust intermingling with persistent roast on the back end for a lingering bourbon barrel presence and touches of raisin past the swallow.



Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body, slick upfront and with minimal carbonation; steadily roasty through the mid-palate and mildly warming into the back end, a deft, boozy heat meshes with subtle grit and distantly chewy textures to close; a surprisingly tame delivery for a barrel-aged stout, though overwhelmingly satisfying given its plush characteristics.



Quietly unique in its extraction of the sweeter malt profile, this beer brings the notion of a cream stout to life with an amplified yet consistently roasty sweetness in tune with a pillowy body and casual warmth; balanced to near-sessionability for a brew of its ABV."

A finger and a half of dense camel hued head with average retention but a unique fingerprint of wide and thin splotchy lacing.



S: Soy sauce but lighter so than all soy brews I’ve encountered. This aroma is offset by burnt sugars, sweet molasses, dark roasted malts and the slightest vanilla and tobacco for a complex and mouthwatering brew. More vanilla as it warms.



T: Follows the aroma mostly, but tends sweeter than I’d hoped for. The sugars mask the complexity found on the nose.

Still quite good. Impossible that a beer rates so high on all parameters but only good on taste.



F: Highest mouthfeel rating I’ve given to a beer lacking the weight and sticky viscosity of the best BCBS years. This one is thinner but also an amazing balance of syrup, sticky, oily, and creamy. It is lighter weight perfection. You must experience.

Nose is again big. Creamy and slightly nutty with a seeming wood influence to the dark coffee and light spice notes. I'm getting a decent amount of creaminess as well as nuttiness, so could this be a stout with hazelnut or perhaps lactose? Smells more like nutty creamy (erm...) than lactose creamy, at least to start. 



Oily and dry and a nice high point of carbonation that helps usher the whole thing along. What it ushers in is cocoa/bakers chocolate and some further light cream. I'm leaning milk stout here, with a nod in the dark toasty side of things. Me likes. Almost kind of a coconut husk kind of thing with the nuttiness I was noting on the nose."

Abrasive Ale

Surly Brewing

Imperial IPA

Date: 17 Dec 2021

Another beer that I have wanted to be marked off my list. The beer is 46 degrees, and I used a tulip glass. A frothy and airy two-fingered bright white head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, deep golden yellow. Clarity is brilliant, with a few carbonation bubbles dancing within. The appearance of the beer is excellent. 

Ripe grapefruit and juicy melon are what I immediately pick up. Smelling beer again, I detect pine, bready, yeasty, honey-like sweetness, oranges, floral esters, and herbal. 

Interesting, I get pineapple, mango, grapefruit, floral, and herbal notes from the first sip. Taking another, I taste bread dough, oranges, pine, lightly toasted malts, pharmaceutical, and a touch of dank. 

The mouthfeel is sticky, sweet, and coating. The body is medium, the carbonation is low, and the finish lingers. 

This is not what I was expecting for this beer. The malts are heavy and drown out the hops. The hop profiles are unique in is own way. I was expecting something like a WCIPA and got a hybrid. I would not say this beer is abrasive. When I think of an abrasive beer, I think of Ruination, the first one, not this newer crap. The beer is okay; nothing special stands out as amazing."

Aroma is fruity citrus deep pine resin, nose is good but not in your face big double IPA like.



Taste is definitely big on hop resin scrap your tounge bitterness. Lingering pine and grapefruit rind bitterness. Flavor is just tropical fruits and citrus. Maybe I'm just expecting more dinner is world class, it isn't bad but eh not world class atleast for me.



Mouthfeel is nice and almost full the oats really help with the mouthfeel.



Overall a solid big IPA."

Taste is super. Big malt core wraps itself around my tongue. Pilsner like and lightly sweet.Then BAM! Citrus and tropical hops flood the mouth. Hop oil and pineapple, bread and mild grain sweetness. Finish is clean and dry and shortish with lingering oil and grains. No trace of alcohol in the flavor. 



Feel is superb. How a beer this big can be this light and creamy. The malted oats really shine here. Silky swallow, crisp carbonation. Just top notch.

For the second time in one Tree House run, we have yet another TH beer in the BA top 250! This one currently sits at #168, and #2 for Milk Stouts, just under their own Moment Of Clarity. Funnily enough, they are both Milk Stouts aduncted with coffee, chocolate, and maple syrup. Let’s crack it open and see how they differ



Pours completely pitch black with 3 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing



The nose is very sweet and maple-forward, but there’s a delicate balance from the roast. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet maple syrup, vanilla, milk chocolate truffle, caramel, brown sugar, medium roast coffee, and light nougat



Once again in taste, there’s a lot of maple, but the balance is even more amazing here. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting sweet maple, toasted oak, dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, brown sugar, light coconut, and dark caramel. The swallow brings notes of sweet maple, chocolate fudge, dark caramel, toasted oak, brown sugar, medium roast coffee, and light molasses



A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a a creamy but not syrupy beer. Finishes slightly sticky but not overly sweet



In a word; wow. Maybe I’m a sucker for maple in Stouts, 2 of my all time top 10 beers are just that, but this is truly awesome. Even better than Moment Of Clarity. Tree House strikes again with this long time want of mine"

Tons of maple on the nose; it's definitely the dominant characteristic, followed by coffee and the rich malt base. I don't get much chocolate standing out from the malt.



Flavor is more balanced: up front, it's a stout, through and through. The maple doesn't take long to show its presence, but it's a bit woodier and far less sweet than the nose. This is certainly amplified by the bitterness of the coffee and chocolate. The result is more in line with a breakfast beer (a la Maple Bacon Coffee Porter) than a dessert beer - which seems to be the goal, based on the description.



Maple, wood, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, toffee, molasses, cream. The flavor really grows; I wasn't blown away by the first sip, but I'm liking it more and more.



An easy trap for a beer like this is to go overboard on the sweetness. While the maple winds up being the star (as so often is the case when adding maple syrup), it's still a pretty well-balanced beer, with plenty of bitterness. It's very approachable for a beer verging on double digit ABV. It lets you know it's pretty big, but it doesn't hit you over the head with it."

Look: Pours a pale golden color with a lot of floaties that eventually settled. There was a nice, fluffly white head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer. The beer became a lot hazier after pouring the bottom of the can.



Smell: Has a pronounced citra hop aroma - lots of grapefruit peel, orange, grassy, with green bell pepper notes on the back end. Smells peppery also and has subtle cantaloupe notes also.



Taste: The taste definitely follows the nose. Strong grapefruit flavors with a moderate to high bitterness on the finish that lingers but does not overpower the palate. It's very drinkable. I think that the flavor filled out a bit also after pouring the bottom of the can.



Feel: Has light to medium body, nicely carbonated.

A classic, had several gallons of this over the years, drank it again after taking a 2+ year break - it is still very good, I like it a lot. Did I mention: I’ve got a thing for Iowa. That might have played a role, too."

Light and inviting floral and citrus aroma. 



It tastes surprisingly juicy on the tongue, with tropical and citrus fruit notes. Mild hop bite and malty sweetness behind. 



Medium bodied and well carbonated.



Overall a great beer. It’s less sharp and more balanced than Zombie Dust or similar Citra APAs, but quite flavorful. And light enough to pair with spicy food.

Aroma: Hops forward. Citrus notes of oranges, tangerines. Tropical fruit.



Flavor & aftertaste: Citrusy & tropical fruit hops flavors. Restrained but balancing bitterness. Medium sweetness.



Mouth-feel: Medium to full bodied. Light to moderate carbonation. Medium length finish with trailing bitterness.



Overall: I can see why this is so highly rated and popular. In short, it has a simple hoppy aroma and flavor profile emphasizing citrus & tropical fruit notes from Citra hops. It is moderately sweet with a perfectly balanced bitterness that makes it's presence known but quickly fades into the background. It has a medium body making it light enough to not be filling but beefy enough not to feel thin. I like the carbonation level which releases nicely when poured properly. You almost feel like you about to experience some hop burn, but it never got there. Tough review for me because I expect American Pale Ale to be clear to slightly cloudy visually, so I had to give it lower marks visually. But this is one excellent pale ale that I enjoyed drinking."

The color is a relatively bright orange-amber, considering how opaque it is. With it, come all the right smells of an American Pale Ale. Malt, hops both citrusy and piney, join with a hint of yeast and alcohol to make a nicely balanced, if not pungent, treat for the nose. These qualities are passed on to the taste, which agrees completely with the nose. The finish contributes a dry bitterness that augments the solid taste. There's just enough alcohol to add another layer without harming the mouthfeel. For the taste and body, there's surprisingly little glass lacing. Nothing new, but this is one good APA."

My first encounter with this beer, and my first review of a beer from Brasserie de Rochefort. Expectations are high considering this beer's world-class ratings.



Poured to a Brasserie D'achouffe tulip.



Thick caramel on the pour; a truly mesmerizing mahogany colored body once collected in the glass. Three fingers of thick airy khaki head with good retention. I truly don't know if i've ever experienced a beer of this vivid dark wood color.

Initial aromas of cream and dark fruits - raisin, fig, dates, plum. A bit of must.

Taste is of sticky dark fruits - lots of plum & fig- sweet, but not ""cloying"". Quite a bit of warming alcohol presence. Has a slightly unpleasant medicinal cherry flavor near the end that I find somewhat distracting. Notes of cream, mineral water. The flavor profile of the beer definitely develops a lot as the beer warms toward room temperature.

Body is exceptionally smooth & silky. Creamy. Full-bodied. Excellent amount of carb.

Probably the best example of this style of beer that I've tried yet. Definitely looking forward to trying the other beers from Brasserie de Rochefort



Trappistes Rochefort 10 -----4/5."

Taste follows the nose. Intense flavour of aged dark fruit up front with a lot of spice and apricot. Sweet notes in the background of caramel and bready malt.

These beers never look worse than ‘amazing’ in a nice goblet.



Both strong and gentle, complex, and boozy aromas swirl in the glass. I’ll try to name the most prominent, they all mix and intermingle together quite well. Nutty, savoury, and slightly spicy aromas on the nose, caramel and toffee. I almost always get a bit of rum like aromas on these quads and Belgian strongs. Others get wine. I think the high abv% + whatever aroma you pick up strongest influences what you tend to associate that alcohol warmth with. For me, it’s always rum and raisins. Definite some sweet, dried dark fruits here and I primarily smell raisin and figs. Possibly some dry dark cherries. Caramel and toffee, some savoury yeasty notes here as well in the back. Some dried, toasted woody grains. With both the aroma and taste, there are so many complexities to it, I don’t think anyone can pick them all out. Everyone gets it a little bit different, which is just another aspect to this phenomenal beer.



As with all Belgian strong beers, the taste evolves significantly throughout the sip. You get the strong alcohol notes up front, and the spicy ones as well. More of that rum soaked raisin cake, delicious yeasts, a touch of cinnamon but mostly nutmeg, peppery like a touch of black pepper. In the middle it’s nicely doughy and malty, with some nice sweet dessert flavours and dried fruit coming out to play. Maybe there’s a bit of dark chocolate here too? Definitely figs, raisins, dark cherries. Woody, port-like flavours in the background as well. Little earthy, little malty on the finish. Still a bit of caramel, toffee, and general dark fruit here.



Body leans towards the fuller side, and the higher alcohol certainly makes it feel thicker. However, the high level of carbonation gives it a very creamy mouthfeel and sip. Long finish, this beer finishes more dry than anything else and mildly sweet. Not as sweet as the nose suggests — tempered by the peppery notes and the carbonation, it keeps this beer wonderfully balanced. That carbonation was surprising but has that nice gentle bite on each sip to enhance that peppery flavour. 



It’s hard for me to not write the same flowery praise for any Tripel, Quadrupel, Dark Belgian. We tend to only carry the best brewery offerings in Canada, and this is a tried and true style coming from a select batch of trappists and brewers who have been making these beers for decades (or even longer). If you’re reading this, I know I don’t really have to convince you. This is good. Really good. Foundational stuff. When you see it next, grab one for you and one for your cellar, you know you will not regret it."

Received via trade from @Providence and boy, do I owe him for this.

Poured a warm dark walnut stained mahogany color and was crowned with a beige head, albeit briefly. Almost looked too pretty to drink.

Aroma wafted politely and was full of dark fruits (Figs, raisins, dates) and sweeter stuff like caramel and toffee. The taste followed, with a few spices that held it back from the cloying sweetness stage and balanced this so ideally I couldn't think of much to improve upon. 

The date on it was about 4 months out so I suspect it was 4 1/2 years old. Still wonderful. Now I have to taste a fresh one!

Color on the pour is an interesting reddish brown. Once in the glass it settles into a deep, deep brown with just the faintest of red. Almost no head, but a mocha colored ring persists. Excellent legs. 



Aroma is rich and boozy. The bourbon / barrel are both there, but so are notes of chocolate, molasses, figs and more. . Very nice smelling beer. 



As for taste, unsurprisingly the coffee has faded and I honestly can't even detect it. That said, I'm not sure it matters all that much, as what's still there is great. For my first few sips I was getting lots of barrel / bourbon, but as my palate has adjusted the depth of the beer became more noticeable. Nothing is in your face. The chocolate, roast, barrel etc. are all subtle enough that each sip leaves a slightly different impression. 



Nice light alcohol warmth and amazingly full, chewy mouthfeel. Maybe I've given a 5 on feel before, but if so, I don't know when. For my tastes, this has a perfect feel. 



Overall, while I wish I'd tried one of these fresh, it's clear that this is a very well-crafted beer that has held up well over time, even without the coffee element."

The bottle is part of a swap with @Artizen, thank you!

The beer pours a pitch black color with minimal dense tan head that foams up only a little bit even after a very aggressive pour. This minimal foam fades away to the thinnest of edge layers quickly after the pour.

Aroma is dark malt, lots of bourbon, some dark chocolate and a bit of toffee. Fairly sweet and robust, but not really boozy at all and no hop profile shows up.

First sip reveals a silky smooth texture and medium to thick body. The carbonation is gentle, spacious and rolls softly across my palate.

Flavor is what I expect for style and what the nose advertises. I get some roasted malt and toffee with a bit of dark chocolate and a good boost of bourbon note. I also get molasses here and some dark fruit too. Again, no hop character, and the booze is very dangerously well hidden.

M: surprisingly full, but still bone dry.

O: This is an interesting beer, it is much more subtle, nuanced and complex than I was expecting it to be. Full disclosure, I’m not a real kriek/Cherry sour fan, so I bought this on reputation alone and while I don’t think my mind has been changed about kriek, I do think this beer is more than the sum of its parts and has some nice complexity to offer. I think the risk and often the temptation with a flavor as big and assertive as cherry is to let it do all the heavy lifting because it tends to be such a people pleaser on its own.

So excited to try this. The be had an Atrial before and it ranked up there as one of my favorite wild ales ever. Upon pouring it, it looks beautiful. Love the color. I’m super disappointed on the nose though. I get a bit of funk and cherrry, but it’s very muted. On the palette though it’s more pronounced. It has a wonderful balance of cherry but could use more bret funk for my preference. I probably like the funk more than most people though. There’s a wonderful balance of sweet and tart with the cherries too. A lovely beer overall. Probably not my top 2-3, but worth the word class ratings."

500ml bottle - b6 (Feb. '19) poured into a fancy tulip at 48°F. 



Pours an almost unbelievable glowing ruby red - I'm talking The Sorcerer's Stone red. Highly polished, highly reflective, mesmerising to stare at glowing ruby gemstone red - clear, but not crystal. A finger of quick, loose, just-slightly-pink head builds up, and then quickly reduces to a thin soapy collar. Some slow effervescence can be seen. 



Nose: There are average cherry wild ales, and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma. This is in the latter category. The amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated, while being entirely organic in nature. Not only is this a cherry bomb aroma, but what is really impressive is how both the Montmorency AND the Balaton cherries seem to translate. There is some intensely sweet, ripe, juicy Balaton character, lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note, bursting with big, deep, dark cherry juice, while the Montmorency cherries lend that floral, fresh, tangy cherry note, with a touch of stem, pit, and even cherry blossom. There is also a healthy amount of oak, and, along with the cherries, seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note, with just a whisper of oaky vanillins. There is a suggestion of acidity, but it doesn't singe the nose when inhaling, and there's very little earthy or barnyard funk. Just some wet oak, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, and a hint of brett. The cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath. There's a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything, which is the icing on the cake. 



Palate: First thing, from the very first sip, it isn't bracing sourness that hits, it isn't tannic oak, it isn't malt, it's sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh. The deep, bold Balaton sweetness greets the palate, giving up its sweet juicy goodness, while never coming across as artificial, cough syrupy, sticky, or overly sweet. This sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the Montmorency character beneath. The Montmorency is not quite as deep, bold, and saturated with juicy sweetness, but it provides a slightly less ripe, slightly fruitier character, that brings Japanese cherry blossom, a bit of plum, a hint of cherry potpourri, cinnamon/amburana wood spice, and a bright, natural, almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table. In addition to this subtle fruity tartness, the acidity lends a near-perfect degree of sour. It really isn't bracing, puckering, or blinding in any way. Make no mistake, this is a sour ale, no question about it, but it isn't Midwest sour. There is some lemony lacto pucker, a bit less of some acetic pedio bite, and a bit more of some tart, funky, mineralic brett, lending not quite salinity, and definitely not sweat, but that classic restrained brett tang, along with some musty wet wood, a little hint of bandaid, and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note. The high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a Kriek vibe. The tartness has a quick downward curve, allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish, paired with a hint of vanilla, a hint of baking spice, a hint of caramel, and a hint of brown sugar. The sourness takes a far back seat, revealing some more dusty brett, and then finally, the ever-so-slightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself, with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley, cereal grains, essence of cherry, and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish. 



Mouthfeel/Body: MvB is light, crisp, and snappy by nature, though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to medium-bodied territory. Effervescence is surprisingly low. It isn't flat, but rather lazy and slow. One might expect this to be a super fizzy, champagne-like experience, but that is not the case, which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel. Soft, round, and even quite juicy upfront, the ale is not scrubbing, and even feels somewhat smooth. The oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades, but the ale itself isn't tannic or ultra-dry. 



Overall: This is a really remarkable cherry wild ale, and an absolute triumph from Jester King. The perceivable differences between the Montmorency and Balaton cherries is a work of art, and the structure, balance, and progression of the ale is nothing short of impressive. The acidity is forward, but kept in check, the sweetness makes a statement up front, and then takes a supporting role, the oak and microflora influence walks a tightrope right down the middle of balanced, and the subtle malty, grainy base beneath it all is something that I always look for, but rarely get in highly acidic ales. This is just absolutely world class."

S: Mango and papaya with a touch of pine resin, not over the top but still very aromatic. The malt is subtle but is combines with the yeast to create a subtle fresh baked bread note.

F: A dry, moderate body and a crisp, low-carbonated finish.



Overall: An excellent NE-Style IPA that showcases mosaic hops very nicely. This beer is all about hop flavor just as any beer in the style should be."

And it seems that my trust was well allocated, because the smell is absolutely beautiful. Chocolate, cream and with a slight fruity sweetness, even the few ounces at the bottom of my glass unfurl up and out and indulge my olfactory with incredible grace and strength. But the taste is spicier, and while it borrows some of the chocolate from the nose, it expresses more like a mole with that kick.

Brewers Notes: Collaboration with J. Wakefield Brewing



We took our original J. Wakefield collaboration Affogato Imperial Stout and aged it in bourbon barrels for 6 months at our Hudson Road barrel house. Affogato Imperial Stout is inspired by a few of our brewers' favorite summertime pick-me-up (& cool-me-down) Barrington's affogato.



Barrel Aged Affogato Imperial Stout is decadent, rich and full. Brewed with a blend of Barrington & Mostra beans, Affogato leads with aromas of vanilla, toasted marshmallows and subtle notes of bourbon. Barrel Aged Affogato has a full, satisfying body and an indulgent palate of vanilla cream, hot cocoa, rich brownie batter, with complimentary doses of smooth coffee and bourbon.



MALT: American 2-Row Barley, Crystal 120, Flaked Oats, Black Malt, Chocolate Malt, Munich Malt, White Wheat Malt, Brown Sugar, Dark Candied Syrup, Lactose

HOPS, ETC: Columbus, Barrington and Mostra Coffees, Madagascar Vanilla Beans



On tap at Trillium Canton, 5oz snifter , black motor oil , thin dark brown big bubbled layer quickly settles to a ring 



Aroma is cocoa, brown sugar, bourbon, and yes brownie batter



Taste is bourbon, cocoa, brownies, coffee



Fizzy mouthfeel , rich, decadent , 13.8% abv, this is a sipper

Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some burnt/charred malt, caramel and earthy/oaky flavors. It's a little more roasty/bitter tasting than I was expecting, but that's not a complaint by any means. All the flavors seemed well balanced with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and a bit rich with a moderate amount of carbonation. And as with most of the Bruery's big beers, it's not as boozy as you'd expect it to be.

Appearance: Black glass, thin halo of tan bubbles, no lacing.



Aroma: Heavy vegetative chili note, burned barrel, some underlying malt sweetness.



Taste: Medicinal alcohol, green pepper, some sweetness comes in deep into the taste, a little coffee in the finish. Hard to get many ""beer"" flavors out of this, even imperial stout flavors. Some pepper burn long after the swallow that builds a bit.



Mouthfeel: Medium heavy body, low, almost flat carbonation, little oily in the finish but pretty clean.

Pours jet black with a super thin tan head around the circumference of the glass. No lacing.

Taste follows the nose. The booze sting is minimal considering the ABV. Good balance between the sweet vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. The spices and coffee combine for an earthy finish that doesn’t last longer than it should.



Feel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation. It doesn’t stick much or leave a thick residue on the tongue, which for me sets it apart a bit from other Prairie stouts.

Palate Contaminants: other beer, plus a nice fatty cheese



Medium brown color and off-white head. Lacing is present, but doesn't last too long.



First smell that hits me is flint. (That's... odd.) Scored sugar. Roasted pecans, honey-covered. This isn't the first time I've had this brew, but I don't remember any of this. 



Maybe I should've downed this one and bought a fresher bottle to review because it has been one of my favorites, even if I haven't had it in years. I mean, none of this rings the ol' olfactory bell for me. Still, I rate the first bottle/can that's possible for me, so if there's wide dispersion in the quality, then it is what it is.



On the taste (of this bottle), if herbal rum were a thing, this would be it, right on down to the alcohol presence. And I suppose you can kick in a little lactose, butter variety. It's much more vegetative than I remember, too. It's more bitter than most FW barrel-aged offerings. Sweetness is moderate. (There's none of the savoriness that I remember.)



At least the build quality is still there. Good, fine carbonation, and there's a really pleasant woody/nutty aftertaste. Good medium-heavy weight. The overwrought alcohol presence is the only detriment.



I need to revisit this one."

Every sip is rich and full.



Overall, it's a great coffee stout - one of the best, the benchmark by which other coffee stouts are judged. It hits the perfect coffee / stout balance to highlight the coffee without making it taste like you're drinking black coffee and with a rich, dark stout as the base that holds up nicely to the coffee.

Glass: snifter

Serving Temp: room temperature (approx 71 F)





Look: Black with huge 2.5-finger khaki head that pretty much fills out the snifter. The head dissipates slowly to leave a slight but consistent khaki coating. Lacing is all the way down the glass.

Overall: A fantastic stout that has been one of my favorites since I first had it back in 2013 or 2014. I try to keep a couple on hand at all times.

The taste is really nice. For the ABV, way too easy to gulp - I tried not to but a couple got the better of me. Smooth, almost soft, the melon and fruit play dominate roles here, a noticeable malt presence (at least I think that's what it is) and a firm stop by the hops bite before we go into juice territory. Really tasty.

The feel is appropriate to the style and without any 'bits' that seem to be always present in hazy beers. Soft is a word that came to mind, smooth another. Not pulpy, but full bodied. Very quaff-able.

Good head production and retention; excellent lacing. Body is a hue somewhere around mango flesh, hazy but not pulpy, and opaque except in the thinnest portions of the glass.



Nose is bold, strong, and bursting with juicy hop notes. Mango, peach, papaya, pineapple, tangerine, and a slight dankness.



Super juicy on the palate, really delivering notes of papaya and mango - and very little else, but in the best possible way. Moderate bitterness (low for an IPA), and a soft, semi-sweet pale doughy malt base that really amplifies the juiciness.



Near perfect mouthfeel, on par with Tree House (the best in the NE IPA game, in my opinion). Creamy and soft, yet with plenty of bite; high-medium to light-full body, with excellent (dangerous) drinkability despite the high ABV.



This beer is the real deal. Absolutely superb."

Upon opening and pouring the beer into a snifter, the chunk remained at the surface which shifted to the bottom of the bottle mid-pour, so I was able to pour the last dregs into a smaller glass where the tan clump plopped out. It was actually hard to the touch as I plucked it from the surface of the beer. My concern began to grow because these Florida pastry stouts usually only have small flakes of more dispersed coconut lipids, which melt instantly and have almost no feel to them. Thankfully, just before my flashbacks of mouse skull chicken McNuggets fully manifested, it did begin melting in the palm of my hand.



Anywho, the body is viscous black with other minor spots of oils surfacing after the burnt mocha blanket quickly disappears to nothing at all.



Smell is Butterfinger with vanilla bean white chocolate and hints of caramel corn. As it warms, charred mocha coffee and brownie crust emerge. The aroma is hypnotizing.



Taste is decadent and a little boozy as the apple brandy barrel makes its presence known, adding sharp oaky liquor notes to the extravagant flavors of coconut filled pâte à choux with chocolate ganache. The body is just thick enough to dampen the barrel to tolerable levels of booze, allowing for additional notes of cinnamon coffee and vanilla custard to surface. The finish is semi-sticky and substantially warming all the way down."

Pours a stunning pitch-chestnut, an almost inky appearance giving way to slight ruby accents as a bubbly half-finger of pale tan head forms, slowly fizzing out to a sparse cap, expansive, frothing collar, and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.



Aroma offers immediate impressions of jammy plum, refining focus to fig, subtle caramel, and toffee over time as an evocative, dark fruit overload springs forth across the bouquet; bourbon on the back end encourages a touch of cherry and lighter cocoa to engage the close.



Taste opens to layers of sugar plum, raisin, dates, and bits of brown sugar, growing in accents of bold fig and burnt caramel into the mid-palate; oaky vanilla meets fruitcake on the back end, while leathery chocolate dusts a barrel edge with slight bourbon and smoked toffee finishing.



Mouthfeel shows a medium body, dense and concentrated silky textures foundational beneath a low-lying carbonation; smooth, wispy grit guides to a mild twang underscoring a vague, burgeoning oxidation into mid-palate, followed by a mild barrel char and steady warmth on the back end, with some stickiness into the otherwise velvety finish.



Belying most any sense of experiencing time and age, this is a rich, comprehensive American barleywine; a deft composition of ultra-bold fruits, calm barrel inflection, and leathery resins encapsulating a consuming, classic apex of the style."

Corona Day #35



I'm back, baby!



Appearance: 4 - looks like a standard barleywine, but a bit darker and redder. It was pretty clear on the pour but almost completely opaque in the glass.



Nose: 4 - smells like a barleywine on some barrel. A bit fruity. Nothing special so far.



Taste: 4 - still nothing special. It's definitely a very nice barleywine, but I'm not sure why it's so highly regarded.



Mouth: 5 - thick, chewy, and round. A very well-crafted brew.



Overall: 4 - a very fine offering, but not anything I'd write home about. My wife would find it very odd to find a hand-written note about a good but not great BA barleywine.

Mild, sharply tart, red fruit aromas of raspberry, cherry; light funk, light lemon juice.

At first the near absence of carbonation is a put off, but there is a very fine, prickly feel, and it ends up doing the job; flavour is appropriately sour, pleasantly puckering, balanced by a light fruity sweetness - like red currants more than anything; have to use your imagination to get a clear sense of raspberry, it's very subtle; there is a faint mustiness and oakiness; long, very dry finish, enticing, lightly sticky.

I poured the sedimentation in a separate mini glass, it has huge blueberry aromas and was much sweeter and richer, a blueberry cobbler character almost. The taste was a little more tart and a little more blueberry forward but still not a ton. Ok back to the main pour. As it warms it opens up a bit like a good wine. Fruit comes out a bit, and lactic acidity builds but still never reaches the mouth puckering tartness of most Cantillons.

It smell and drinks sweet, but not to a point of being cloying, or sickly. Mouth feel is velvety and creamy, with a thick consistency. Overall, a thick and sugary beer, that while it lands more in the dessert beer category, does present itself exceptionally well as balanced and filling.

Lacing: A fairly broken soapy lacing. You can tell where each sip ended but no full rings were established.



Body: Literally looks like a glass of orange juice with a subtle head.



Smell: Like a great NEIPA. Subtle and balanced, like a hoppy pine tree accompanied by a well proportioned waft of citrus. A mango/orange backed by hopps smell to be exact. 



Taste: Incredibly smooth, no burn, not pungent but a well balanced bittersweet juice taste with a strong fruity citrus that ends quickly with a smooth slight lactose bitter finish.



Tail end: It leaves you knowing you just sipped a top notch beer. Quite possibly one of the best New England India Pale Ales I have ever drank. Its orange juice water in terms of smoothness. 



After Taste: Almost non existent other then a slight citrus reminder that ends in a very calm cream ending. 



As someone who has drank multiple beers from Treehouse, micro projects to the ninth best beer on this website, I can see how this beer is rated as a 100 after almost 1,000 ratings. This beer is a true diamond in the rough.

Alright, finally time to cross another top 250 Tree House beer! This one is currently sitting at #133. I believe this is only brewed once a year so I’m happy to have made it there when they had it available. Let’s crack if open and see what it’s all about



Pours a hazy pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing



There’s a nice bite to the nose in this one, leaning a bit more traditional than they usually do. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe cantaloupe, bready malt, peppery hops, orange zest, resin, mango juice, and light gooseberry



It doesn’t quite have the same bite in taste, but I do like it quite a bit. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe mango, white wine, gooseberry, bready malt, grassy hops, light caramel, pineapple juice, and cantaloupe. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, peppery hops, caramel malt, tangerine, gooseberry, light white wine, and overripe cantaloupe

It matches the intensity in taste, really striking a nice balance.

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet creamy beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries over time

L - Appearance is a deep dark brown, nearly black.

S - Very sweet aroma of chocolate, molasses, and possibly root beer?

T - Not at all like it smells, and I can’t quite put my finger on the flavors. Mild carbonation, and I like it better as it warms. Not at all sweet, maybe even a bit bitter. Root beer? Char? Can’t quite tell, but unlike any barrel aged stout I’ve had.

More cherries and dark fruits. Some raisins too. Some molasses. Subtle spiciness. Possibly some hints of rye and black pepper in the mix. The bourbon is subtle but noticeable and blends well with everything. Subtle sweetness. Low bitterness. Solid malt backbone. Subtle alcohol flavors in the finish along with an enjoyable warmth, but it's not hot or boozy at all. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full-bodied with moderate carbonation.

This is a pretty solid barrel-aged stout. It's subtle and bold at the same time. I always liked Plead The 5th, but never tried the barrel-aged version so I'm glad to have finally tried it after all of these years. It's simply enjoyable and fun to drink. Not bad at all. I like it."

Brewers Notes: Daily Serving was born out of our desire to express intense, saturated fruit character in beer form. After thoughtful experimentation with Permutation 6.47 and 6.51, we found that a base recipe similar to the German Berliner Weisse style, with its delicate, yet fluffy mouthfeel and even-keeled acidity is the perfect foundation for robust fruit additions.



For Twice the Daily Serving, we've amplified the mouthfeel, fruit addition, and ABV to achieve our most expressive and luscious fruit beer to date. Brewed with an outlandish amount of raspberries, this beer pours a gorgeous deep ruby red color. Lively aromas of homemade jam, juicy raspberry, and mixed berry fruit leather delight the palate. It finishes full-bodied, slightly sweet, and remarkably drinkable.

Kane Brewing's pick-me-up and put-me-down Imperial Porter means that you can have that Sunday brunch anytime you'd like.



Bourbon Barrel Aged Sunday Brunch is a bold and dark ale that pours with a scant froth and a near-black appearance to achieve the look of a dark roasted coffee. Its decadent and roasty scent immediately strikes the nose with maple, bourbon spice, cocoa and coffee. Its strong malty taste greets the tongue with a hearty sweetness of maple, molasses, caramel, candied coconut and vanilla.



And that decadence continues across the middle palate as the sweetness turns to a robust. dark roast coffee, walnut, dark chocolate wrap around the caramel and cream, and ushers in a bittersweet taste with nuances of charred oak, coconut, peppery whisky and a woodsy bitterness to offset the lingering malts.



Full in body, the lavish porter is mild enough in texture to mimic the feel of a nougat, suggared espresso bean, except with a hot chocolate under current. Spiced with a bourbon inspired glaze, the oaken attitude of charred woods and peppery tannins play a sweet and spicy tune on the after palate."

Thin head fades quite quickly. Big maple syrup aroma, followed by chocolate and coffee. Barrel aroma is faint. Tastes like the original Sunday Brunch, with an additional depth to it via barrel aging. Flavor is dominated by maple syrup; cinnamon follows quickly, and finishes with a touch of coffee. Cinnamon adds a gritty dimension to it, and becomes pervasive as it warms. The bourbon barrel treatment doesn’t offer a lot in this beer unfortunately. Just a little extra chocolate and mellowness. Carbonation is light, and it feels thin, has a bit of a tanginess to it. Overall, not an exceptional BA beer from Kane, I expected a little bit more from the barrel program than this.

The neck tops a bone white hue with a darkened downturn, of a penny toned rim. Thus, not much room for retention, which is limiting on lace entanglements. A collar that continues to lessen with a sensibility on heat, for slightly etching the windowpanes



S: A barrel awareness to stronghold the roasted grains with a bourbon presence. The start is a molasses coating on dark fruit skins, as an espresso roast loiters to the maple backs, of a sickly shrewd growth. Namely, a syrupy tumor upon the timed warmness, as malt creams the humid agilities. There are light recordings of Cherry Cordials at the midriffs, while maple further purifies a combating to an adjoining development in the bourbon spaces. Meanwhile, a balanced hop weight to avoid a suffocating middle, which provides a light peppery woodiness near rearward resin. Subsequently, a hindmost movement from soft to mild – vanilla oak – tannins that signify a leathery convoy, besides the smoked-dry turfs 



T: The exertion has a cask dynamism of arrogance, as malt initially struggles to materialize off of burnt coffee. Howbeit, liquored hardihood stretches upon charred Raisinets, while conveying angles to figs & plums. Some positioning on early adoptions to tire track licorice with woodsy tannin partitions, which aid to reinforce those black treacle gears. In succession, a measure for the warming openness to adapt a caramel spread, for Scottish tablets, amidst the maple reinforcements on artisan S'mores. There is a small stake to reference trees of a deciduous nature, while dabbing at coniferous pine needles. This element further stretches across birch & paperbark maple, given a sharp (resinous) bite to kick-off the epilogs. To that end, a prevalence for maple to gridlock bourbon atop ruggedly pruned rawhide, while citing a slow-burning chimney fire



M: Sharply cutting feel that’s savvy in foundation with a bitter earthiness, and one to quickly smoothen out to the minute. In doing so, the effort is careful to not middle a cloyingness, by maintaining a clean acuity to the riding sweetness. There is a range of warmth that’s distinctively strong, but not a concern to dictate a heated fiasco. In parallel, a touch of acerbic tannin throughout, which works to profit the additives attributes with a slight sting to the clean & dry cessations



O: A fairly accessible presentation with a barrel presence to check the (semi-stick) extracts. A tactic that’s proficient in coordinating the rich malt layers to the woodsy hop effects, while bourbon perimeters all of their showpieces"

In taste the sweetness is mostly up front, and it starts to dry off into a slightly more traditional Stout on the back end. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting coffee candy, milk chocolate, brown sugar, toast, vanilla, sweet bourbon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of spent coffee beans, fruity coffee, cocoa powder, vanilla, brown bread, raisin, and caramel



A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a nice roast character



I gotta say, with this newly brewed version of this beer being at 8.2%, I didn’t really think it would be a true American Stout. And is it that? No, not really, but it still retains some old school characteristic, and it’s just damn good regardless. I’m happy to have made a trip up to Tree House mostly for this beer"

Poured deep dark, not exactly black but darn near. The head was as dark a brown as I have seen on a beer, the one knock was the head didn’t stay long.

The aroma, mostly I just get vague impressions of aromas as I foolishly didn’t wear a respirator when working with some nasty chemicals. Every once in a while I get more, and those are treats! This one gets me coffee and roasted malts and bourbon and vanilla. Mostly coffee, but wow it’s all in there.

The taste followed, coffee leads and filled the spectrum at first, only swallowing allowed the roasted malts and bourbon (bourbon soaked Madagascar vanilla beans, who knew?) and the vanilla sneaks in last. I enjoyed every sip and it was gone too soon.

The feel was excellent for the sipping nature of this beer, soft almost, counters the nearly bitter coffee presence.

OA, thoroughly enjoyed this beer and now I want to go to the brewery for a vacation. Sadly, my partner said no. If I wanted to stay married that is."

Double Shot

Tree House Brewing

Date: 18 June 2021

This is the last Tree House beer; I have in my Fridge. Every beer I have consumed thus far has been blown my expectations away. My first stout from Tree House; when I opened the can, a heavy coffee aroma emitted. I poured the beer into my fancy imperial stout glass. The pour created a creamy and foamy dark brown two-fingered head with excellent retention. The color charts around SRM 26, dark brown like used motor oil without the highlights. 



Coffee is strong and present with the initial nosing. Dark roasted malts, toffee, molasses, a hint of smoke, a touch of char, and tobacco. The smell is dominated by the fragrant coffee aromas. 



One of the strongest coffee-flavored beers next to Oliphant Brewing Coffee Ale. The molasses, caramel, and toffee tempering out the bitterness. This created velvety coffee flavors. The dark roasted malts give some char, bready, and earthiness to the beer. I detect 



The mouthfeel is creamy, chewy, and bold. 



The body is heavy, has low carbonation, and has a robust finish. 



The coffee flavors in the beer are rich and flavorful. One of the best coffee beers I have consumed in a long time. A must-try for any coffee stout lover."

Super sweet coffee and chocolate aroma with a touch of boozy Esa to it. Extremely sweet, has a nice coffee flavor, feels like there is a ton of maple syrup in it. Very sweet. Carbonation adds to a creamy texture. Overall a very good beer, but extremely sweet.

Look: Pours a hazy light yellow with a fluffy white head that dissipates after a while leaving lots of lacing. Some floaters visible.



Smell: Fresh tropical fruits, especially pineapple, mixed with some citrusy notes of orange and tangerine.



Taste: Quite contrary to the smell, citrus notes are dominating here with tropical pineapple and mango in the background. Medium sweetness with a slightly bitter, minimally zesty finish.



Feel: Fresh, juicy and quite full. Medium carbonation.



Overall: Full and fragrant pale ale that tastes somehow exactly as you‘d want a double dry hopped 6.8 ABV version of Pseudo Sue to taste. One of the best pale ales I‘ve had and quite rightly a top ten beer in this category."

Wet straw color, completely opaque. Lots of very fine white head, with lots of lacing.



All sorts of citrus on the nose. Red grapefruit, acidic orange, touches of lime. Moderately sweet malt. Marshmallows. It strikes a really nice balance.



The fruits are dialed back in the taste, and there's more of a vegetation/leafy flavor up front. Mild bitterness. Tart sweetness shows up a bit late, right there with the citrus. The flavors are notably sharp, too. (And this particular can was brewed five weeks ago.)



Aftertaste is bitter, but it's a dull bitterness. Very nicely integrated carbonation, and it's one of the finest I've run across. Medium weight."

It’s been a while, but I’m back with another BIF beer from @Eziel! This guy supplied me with some truly crazy stuff, and I’m hyped to try this one out. I really liked the raspberry cobbler Black Tuesday variant, so I have high hopes for this one too. Let’s dive into it



Pours a surprisingly light muddy brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to nothing and leaves no lacing



The nose here is quite pungent, perhaps an artifact of 5 year old vanilla beans and cacao nibs. I'm picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, dark chocolate, vanilla bean, heavily roasted coffee, hot bourbon, light toasted oak, and molasses



Whereas the nose was charmingly pungent, the taste is a bit sharp and aggressive. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting hot bourbon, burnt coffee, vanilla bean, dark chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and molasses. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, toasted oak, vanilla bean, cacao nibs, black cherry, burnt coffee, toasted oak, and caramel



A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and boozy (duh) beer. Finishes dry but with a serious alcoholic heat



Damn, I don't know if it was the age, but I really did not vibe with this one. It's hard to say if it was once well constructed, as it doesn't even really show a shell of what it used to be, save for the aroma. Hopefully the Black Tuesday Reserve he sent me is much better"

Look: Pours a hazy, slightly muddy yellow with a stable foamy head that leaves a good amount of lacing. A few floaters visible.



Smell: Fresh citrus fruits and pineapple. Green and a bit dank.



Taste: Green hops and fresh fruits. Citrusy (lemon and orange) and tropical (pineapple and guava). Some hints of sweetness and a zesty, very bitter finish.



Feel: Juicy and quite crushable. Medium carbonation and some sharp notes.



Overall: As much as I prefer Very Green over Green, I prefer Very Gggreennn over Gggreennn. Sounds confusing, but this one tastes just a bit too green for me. It's still a very nice brew with the typical Tree House characteristics."

Very Green is probably my most favorite beer I’ve ever had. The flavors, the aroma, all of it. This is every bit what Very Green was from what I remember. I can’t say if it’s more flavorful or not, I just don’t have the reference point. All that being said, hot damn I love this beer. So dynamic. Juice slams you in face on the initial sip and then it fades to a piney after taste. You really kinda hit both NEIPA and West Coast styles all in one sip. Their is a slight difference when drank from the can and a glass. The can lip seems to fizz up the beer and almost hides some of that juice at the start. From the glass it’s so pronounced and smooth. The “green” beers are heaven, and the TreeHouse concept of “maxing them out” is a wonderful idea. It’s like heavy legs day at the gym. How much can I really do?

Initially, the taste answers the question of what adding more Sunny D to a glass of Sunny D would taste like. The answer is Sunny D. It's OJ without the tartness, sweet yet somehow watered down at the same time. Flat, one-note sweetness. On the finish, however, it does develop some - hints of hop spice, a little resin here, a little pine there. White and black pepper. Mouthfeel, however, is pleasantly soft and full.

There was a canned date of 05/19/22 on the bottom of the can. I bought this at the brewery, and drank this about 3 months after purchase.



Appearance: Deep gold color with 2-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.



Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.



Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.



Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 8.8% listed on the can.



This is an excellent New England IPA. As expected, similar to King Julius, but with a little more citrus flavors. It has a nice mix of citrus, hops, and other flavors, which makes it enjoyable.

Yeah, this was one of those beers.



One of my friends went up there recently and brought down a bunch of their recent releases. All were solid, as was this, was it was a worthy iteration of the Julius family. Poured like orange juice, felt like orange, juice, and had possibly the best head and lacing that I've ever seen in a Tree House beer as it perfectly settled and left behind thick rings that nearly resembled a sheet. Quite a sight to behold as the sensory enjoyment easily bled over into the nose and taste. Loads of dewy forest, dank hops, apricot, stone fruit, turbid orange, and slick juice were found in both as the smell and flavor profile of this brew were one and the same. So smooth, so fun, and so easy to fall in love with, this had a nice body, hints of wheat in the taste, and went down *way* too easily with a bit bit of dankness and floral notes staying around in the aftertaste.



I have no idea how this was 8.8% ABV as this felt like fermented juice with some hops and a bit of tropical fruit and swamp water thrown in for fun. Dated 8/24 on the bottom of the can with ""IT IS YOUR DESTINY"" written above it, the Star Wars reference was fun, just like the rest of this outstanding brew. Use the force, or whatever it takes, to get your hands on this and thank Tree House for still killing it after all of these years!"

Pours an inky black body topped with over two fingers of fluffy, khaki-colored foam; decent head retention leaves paper-thin islands of cap, large, frothy collar, minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass.



Aroma brings a soft touch of molasses upfront, carrying soft caramel creams into a steadily building oaky vanilla and eventually culminating with robust waves of raw cacao meeting oaky bourbon.



Taste opens with bittersweet cocoa tinged with toasted oak barrel and residual bourbon characteristics, though the malt is central, peaking over the mid-palate with the purest, flaky roast sensations cooly revealing layer upon layer of oily, raw cacao, burnt almond, and evocative dark chocolate.



Mouthfeel shows a medium-light body, silkily textured and, in tune with a soft, prickly carbonation, sporting mild gritty accents into the mid-palate; suggestions of distant char and balanced booziness enhance over the back end, eventually leveling out to a dry roast along the palate's finish.



Chocolate, malted chocolate, dragged from the most evocative expanses of its malt profile and kissed with a softly integrated bourbon implicating a doting heat to further accentuate the already resonant roast; a classic sipper, its quintessence on full display."

There's some dark fruit and lots of dark chocolate, along with a cigar-like bitterness.



This is medium bodied, not quite as thin as most Central Waters, with a *slightly* prickly carbonation to it. If the carbonation was dropped a smidgen, the mouthfeel would be much better.

Smell - The nose was malty bourbon. The booze does not dominate. There was a nice malty presence. 



Taste - this was like barrel aged chocolate malt. The profile was well balanced. It was like chocolate malt, but it was not too boozy. Darker chocolate emerged at the finish. 



Mouthfeel - The lower carbonation allowed chocolate to linger. 



Overall - The chocolatey goodness lingered nicely."
"1666819579-1116","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/","Black Gold","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/652/185536/","Striking gold isn't easy. Once you find it once, you gotta keep going back time after time. And that's what Central Waters Brewing does with their bourbon barrel aged American Double Stout. Except, its black gold.



And the beer of that exact namesake pours with the consistency of used motor oil, black and inky upon the pour, a patient froth begins to release. The draw of caramelized char, coffee, chocolate, nuttiness and wonderfully burnt cream is too much for the nose to resist. In similar form the initial taste is lush with molasses, brown sugar and cream in suggestive of roasted marshmallows.



As the flavors roll along the middle palate, a strong sense of coffee, cocoa and roasted walnut overcomes the sweetness and begins to usher in the bourbon complexities with charred oak, vanilla, coconut, cherry and caramelized whisky spice. Trending moderately bitter, the late palate highlights a walnut character with coffee-like bitterness although all are probably hop-derived.



Full bodied and quite decadent overall, the rich and chewy ale never promotes cloying textures, but finishes long and fat with malt flavor and mouthfeel. An extended warmth of peppery whisky and a simmering bourbon heat resonates slightly past the char and the beer's nearly port-like fruitiness."

Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. So great to find an traditional triple IPA with real malt flavor, lots of fruit and pine and substantial bitterness in the finish. I was struck but the mild sweetness of this one, but with all the mixed fruit it fit perfectly. Some hotness, but plenty of flavor to cover the ABV well.

Aroma: I could smell it before I got close to the glass. Sweet orange, peach, strawberries, pine sap, cantaloupe, a little Cannabis, rich honey-like sweetness, ruby-red grapefruit, Hawaiian bread, tangerine, and an ever-so-slight ethanol waft

Taste: Whoa. A huge rush of mixed citrus fruits storm onto the palate as honey-like sweetness and berries start to mix in. Pine and dank herb appear from time to time and malt sweetness is ever-present and closes with a big hop bite and alcohol heat

Mouthfeel: Full, slick, slightly cloying but far from palate-taxing, and decently dry on the finish along with some alcohol heat

Overall: This is a big-time beer and a good one at that. This was my first time with this beer in years and was pumped when I saw they had finally canned it (or packaged it at all) but glad it’s not around often as it’s a huge Triple IPA and it shows. Tons of hops, tons of malt sweetness, boozy, and unabashedly so - you know it’s big but doesn’t drink like it’s 11.5%. A well done and tasty IIIPA. Recommended."

32oz growler served in a SIP Fest 2020 snulip. Bought it yesterday at Thirsty Hop. I've had this several times before, but the first time in a situation where I could sit down and pay attention and write my thoughts.



Pours a clear light amber with a small head. Looks thick. Lots of fine slow carbonation. Smell is booze, pine, lemon. Might get a little honeysuckle.



Taste is a boozy blast, lemon and citrus for sure, so much resin and pine, kind of dancing around -- first I taste this, then that then it switches again. Hard bitter finish. Something kind of tropical in there, too.



Mouthfeel is medium and surprisingly dry. Overall...this is really good. Dangerously easy to drink. I knew it was really good. It's nice to pay attention to it. I consider this a prime example of west coast style TIPA."

Pours a thoroughly opaque, murky mango colour with a finger or so of super-soft, sudsy head. Retention is quite good, leaving a sudsy cap and a tattered blanket of foamy lacing.



Nose is unexpectedly quite feeble. Subtle aroma of that signature TH peachy-bubblegum-yeasty thing but too faint to say much more than that.



Taste follows the nose inasmuch as it isn’t as intense as I expected - which isn’t entirely a bad thing. Tasting fleshy peach, tangerine peel and a shit-ton of macerated bitter green tree leaves. The usual, expected supporting notes of mango, grapefruit juice, papaya and sticky pineapple.



Feel is… this can is, what, nearly two weeks old and the hop-onslaught is still so intense that it no-shit made my throat constrict! I actually took a moment to wonder which of my neighbours was most likely to have an epi-pen. Aside from that, it’s soft and juicy, medium bodied and brightly carbonated. Dry, sticky lips.



Overall, aside from the epic hop-burn, it’s not as crazy as I might have expected - which, again, aside from the price, isn’t entirely a bad thing.

Received from @beersnake1 in Bif15 , poured into a smog city brewing glass also from him. The #4 ranked barley wine on beer advocate is a double barrel aged barley wine 





Brewers Notes: A blend of two different Double Barrel-Aged Barleywines. The first Barleywine was aged in a Woodford Reserve Malt Whiskey barrel for over 20 months, then finished in a combination of Weller and Blanton Bourbon casks for close to a year. The second Barleywine was first aged in an Armagnac puncheon for close to two year, then finished in a blend of Heaven Hill Rye and Sazerac Rye casks. Each beer was cold-conditioned in stainless, and then blended together to create this Double Barrel-Aged Barleywine.





Dark , murky, muddy brown liquid capped by a thin taupe foam layer , quickly recedes to a taupe ring 



Aroma is bourbon, raisins, toffee



Taste is bourbon soaked raisins, toffee, dark fruits , 



Mouthfeel is soft and fizzy , sweet , the 15.7 % abv is very well hidden

The beer has a two finger tall foamy tan head that slowly reduces to a small to medium sized patch of wispy very thin film covering approximately 25% of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edge of the glass. Light amounts of lacing are observed.



S: Moderate to strong aromas of Armagnac/Brandy + Bourbon + Rye over the top of slightly stronger than moderate aromas of toasted + bready + caramel + toffee malts with a slightly stronger than moderate amounts of dark fruit (raisin + plum + cherry) + caramel + toffee sweetness. Light to moderate aromas of toasted oak + vanilla.

M: Full bodied with light to moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth with slightly heavier than moderate amounts of alcohol warming in the finish.

EBB night 3, beer 4! The finale! It's quite funny to me how I planned for me and my buddy to drink these box beers together over 3 nights and made sure this one was the finale, pretty much right as al the beers were officially announced. I just wanted something huge to finish off with. Now, I'm drinking what climbed up to the 4th highest rated American Barleywine, and the 93rd highest rated beer overall on BA. That's absolutely wild for a fest-exclusive beer, and I couldn't be more excited to finally try this one. Let's get into it



Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light tan head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing



This is very boozy in the nose, quite sweet for an American expression if the style. I’m picking up on aromas of brown sugar, hot bourbon, raisin, sweet caramel, dark bread, and light vanilla



As I’m sipping this, I think it’s good, but not really as good as everyone else is making it out to be. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dates, molasses, brown sugar, earthy bourbon, vanilla, dark bread, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of dark cherry, earthy toffee, spicy whiskey, vanilla, light rye, raisin, and brown sugar



A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and boozy beer. Finishes mostly dry from the booze



Yeah so this was good, but I don’t think it was anything near what it was hyped up to be. I don’t think it was masterfully blended or anything but I enjoyed it"

Super rich truffles, thick dark caramel, molasses, bourbon. The taste is absolutely crazy. Very very intense. Follows the nose very nicely. Rich toffee, chocolate, bourbon, Armagnac, figs, maple syrup, blackberries, red grapes, port, and a very slight roasted malts note.

It’s very pretty for a beer. The perfect Instagram shot can be has for anyone with this given it’s bright colors. There’s a little lacing that stays around. I don’t get as much on the nose as I’d like from the absolute favorite IPAs I’ve had. It smells grapefruit zesty and you get that on the tongue. The beer shines through in its bitter balance with sweetness. Alcohol is very well hidden. Why do they make these in only 12oz cans!! My favorite Hop Butcher IPAs often have a softer mouthfeel than this guy, but this is still wonderful. Wow, a great IPA and so glad to be able to have some. Would never pass on it."

Great red counterpoint to Vigneronne. Huge barnyard funk in the aromas with a bit of red wine coming through in the back. Tart, tannic, and winey in the flavors. Maybe a bit vinegar-y, but that's how it is with Cantillon. Basically the liquid equivalent of farmhouse cheese

what I can add from memory: for me, this is the one from that first flight that had the most personality, and I think my drinking buddy would agree, he being a luster of red wine... I believe this beer poured near brilliantly clear, making its reddish-purple hue more vibrant and alluring, mwahaha... its slight phenolic note definitely hits first and firm, while its fruity flavors take a few moments to surface... the 'plum' flavor for me wasn't so much fresh fruit as it was a ghostly concentrate essence of floral fruity aromatics, lingering in the background... would love to try it again from a bottle (2039)"

Pours a clear reddish purple with a finger of light pink head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing



It’s quite soft in the nose, but there’s still the requisite funk. I’m picking up on aromas of red wine vinegar, lemon juice, wheat bread, wet hay, stone, and sharp oak



There’s more bite to it in taste, but conversely less grape. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting wildflower honey, lemon juice, straw, apple skin, red grape, light toasted oak, and a hint of cherry. The swallow brings notes of lemon zest, wet hay, sharp oak, red wine vinegar, crabapple, light blueberry, and pear skin



A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes bone dry and tart

"1666819592-1177","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/","Saint Lamvinus","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/388/8954/","2019 Vintage - poured into a wine stem at 45°F. 



Pours a bright, translucent ruby stone red, with half a finger of pinkish-white head forming, and then immediately settling to a thin collar. Simple, but very pretty.



Nose: Soft grainy base, with raw wheat and dusty grain silo, beneath a very bright, vibrant fruit layer. This isn't deep, saturated, sweet grape, but young, fresh, and juicy. Some underlying jammy notes of red currant, blackberry, raspberry, peak through, with a deeper red wine note coming in and out of focus. Some gooseberry, pear, and lemon notes lend brightness and fruity acidity atop a very restrained, young funk presence, with hay, stable, leather, wet oak, petrichor, grass, and topsoil. 



Palate: Saint Lamvinus greets the palate with a mildly tart spark, paired perfectly with a thread of sweetness. I believe both the grain *and* the fruit are lending some sugars here. Bright, yet musty grape, with a touch of red berries, abd then the brighter notes emerge, showcasing lemon, gooseberry, white grape, and unripe stone fruit. With this, the tartness increasing, becoming fully dry, with high minerality opening the door for classic Cantillon funk - sea shells, salty air, old wet oak, hay, damp soil, and an almost brie/bloomy rind neutral musty note. Some significant oak tannins emerge, alongside a subtle, tonic-like bitterness. Tartness disappears, finishing with red wine cask, grape skin, and grapefruit pith. 



Mouthfeel/Body: This seems to have found its sweet spot, with 7% ABV balancing between enough grain to lend presence, but not enough to advance from the background. Delicate and fluid, but enough body to lend a softness. Effervescence is extremely fine and gentle, but still fairly fizzy. Not puckering - tartness is kept in check, and allows for a progression of dryness. Balanced tannins. 



Overall: A delicate, expressive, and definitively Cantillon Cantillon. The grape presence appears simple at first, but unfurls with some subtle but complex depth, pairing with just the right amount of complimentary funk. The subtle suggestion of sweetness is beautiful, and the lambic proceeds with these little ""chapters"" of flavour. Remarkably balanced and approachable, with an elegant simplicity."

Notes via stream of consciousness: The label states that this is the ""twin brother to Julius"", and that it ""builds upon Julius with... Mosaic and Amarillo..."". A finger's width of off-white foam tops a murky golden colored body with an orange sheen. The head appears to be holding quite well so far. The aroma offers upsome sweetish malt, soft berries, and orange. The flavor is fuller with additional notes of mango, passionfruit, peach, lychee, floral blossoms, grass, pine, and earth. A median bitterness balances it and along with a little bit of ""hop bite"" leads to a dry finish with some fruit, pine, earth, and spice lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied but with a lot of extra proteins that makes it seem fluffier and somewhat fuller. It's gently crisp and then smooth. The head held up quite well and there are torn sheest of lace and craggy rings left throughout the glass. I actually like this better than Julius but that's probably just because Mosaic hops are my current favorite.

Pours a hazy pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing



The nose shows a surprising amount of balance, but it makes sense considering it’s based on Julius. I’m picking up on aromas of juicy mango, peppery hops, apricot, doughy malt, orange juice, and papaya

There is zero subtly here, and yes I know the point is to scale things “way up”, but this literally hits just one hop-burn note. Disappointing for sure



F: more balanced than some recent trillium offerings, not as sticky sweet with this one



O: ehhh, not worth the hype at all, like so much of what trillium offers nowadays"

A: Pours an extremely dark brown hue with 1/2 inch fizzy dark mocha head that quickly recedes.

S: Dark chocolate, strong bourbon, brown sugar, vanilla, leather, and molasses.

T: Dark chocolate, a burst of dark dried fruit, bourbon, oak, vanilla, toasted caramel malt, crème brûlée, and a vinous note around the edges. With warming, anise and almond notes emerge.

M: Heavy body. Extremely smooth and supple feel. Layers of dark sweetness. Plush vinous feel too. A surprising bit of cola fizziness. Lingering spicy warmth. ABV is well hidden, but potent at 18.9%!

This monster pours a dark brownish black with a moderate head of light brown 

foam that settles to a thick ring that dissipates to a thin ring with no lacing....but

give it a swirl and this one has some nice legs! Bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark roasted

goodness, dark bakers chocolate, dark coffee, raisins, and astringent booze notes. 

Flavors nail it! Dark bakers chocolate in bathed in rich bourbon, vanilla, oak, rich

char, dark berry notes of blackberry and raspberry, brewers licorice, and dark bread. 

Excellent mouth feel for such a beast-----smooth, rich, coating, full body, light 

carbonation with subtle lift, and a warming, bourbon forward, bitter roasted

malt finish that is medium dry.



Overall-----phew! What a brew!

Poured into a stout snifter the color of black coffee while being poured, looked onyx black with enticing looking light brown foam *trying* to form a head but failing, leaving a ring of foam around the edge.

The aroma is amazing, and my sense of smell is poor. Bourbon soaked oak, figs or prunes, molasses, leather all roll up into one delectable aroma, though from the description, I wouldn't have thought so. (Leather? Huh)

The taste is somehow sublime and over the top. Sublime in layers, the fig and/or prune flavor rises and falls through the chocolate and coffee and char that swirl in, all of which are supplanted by a powerful bourbon laced malty wonderful that is the body of this beer. At 19.5% ABV I was expecting heat from the raw alcohol, but that aspect is all but gone.

The feel is definately viscous, and rightfully so. Almost overly so. Just a bit. But that's a tiny quibble.

OA, Wow, really tasty."

Aroma is strong, the brew smells like vanilla, bourbon, molasses, figs, dark chocolate, cream, roasted malt and some licorice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some burnt/charred malt, oak, booze, earthy, dark bread and coffee flavors. There's a lot going on with this brew! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and syrupy with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. Has a boozy kick but it's still pretty drinkable for being that strong.

Found it in a 16 oz can. I've had So Happens it's Tuesday, which I loved, but this is my first of the original. Maybe $25 was too much, maybe not. We'll see. In any case it's the highest ABV of any beer i've ever tried. 17% was the highest I've sampled, but this knocks that back a couple points. I've got a 2020 bottle. Poured out into a snifter, half inch head bubbled up and licked the sides of the glass, receding into a thin collar of beige. The smell is exquisite. That's a strong word, i know, but i think it deserves that descriptor. It's full and strong, bourbon and licorice and fig, that stings the back of the nose as it goes in. 5 on the smell. Love it. Let's sip now, Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, licorice, fig, smoke, char, leather, damn, this is very comparable to Bourbon County Stout. This has been barrel aged for a year, and it sure picks up that bourbon flavor, filling the crevices of my mouth in such a delightful way. I had Indian food for dinner, and I love the layers Indian has, it seems to fill up every bit of my palate. This beer is the same way, it has a way of overcoming and washing over my tastebuds, allowing me to pick up on lots of layers of flavor. It's also like Indian because it's got a spiciness to it, that tickles my tongue and overwhelms me. There is light carbonation, and a medium mouthfeel, not too thick and not too thin. Overall I'm very impressed with this and i'm glad I bought two cans of it. This is the beer of a mature drinker. This is the beer of a wise man. This is the beer of a guy who's well traveled. This is the beer of a guy who's got a financial plan. This is the beer of a man with an important job. This is the beer of a man who knows how to relax with class. This is the beer of a good father.

Mexican Brunch kicks off with a very dark brown pour and a frothy cap that fades rather quickly. As a scent of coffee rises first, a quick followup of syrup, chocolate, nuttiness and spice ensure a complex and enticing scent. Fully malted and sweet on the tongue, high impressions of chocolate, caramel, maple, toffee and vanilla play out in hot chocolate fashion in its early impressions.



As the flavors start to unfold, the middle palate holds onto its milky sweetness while the strong taste of coffee sets an earthy, nutty and roasty tone. Cinnamon and chilies mingle next for a sense of balance for the sweetness and to complement the coffee spice. Woodsy, earthy and toasty, the beer trails into a kahlua-like finish with balance and contrast in taste.



Full bodied and soothing on the finish, the beer finishes both spicy and calmly with the milk sugars and maple rounding out the gradual simmer of peppers into a warming afterglow of a Mexican inspired, alcoholic cappuccino."

- Imperial Milk Stout brewed with Rook Coffee, maple, and cinnamon. 



A: Beautiful cascading effect with a dark tan head that is creamy and dense, standing a true two inches. The exiting pour was coffee colored, thick and viscose as it slurps from the bottle. Strong lasting coverage. Lots of micro-bubbly activity. 



S: Burnt molasses, and chocolate. Dark sweet fruit, plums, sugary figs outlines. Sweet caramel and milky vanilla highlights. The maple syrup is rich and sweet, as well with evident hints of cinnamon spicing. Sweet initially, rich chocolate and marshmallow with cocoa. Things progressively move towards a smooth roastiness of cold coffee, caramel, and milky vanilla highlights. 



T: Sweet dark fruit, particularly figs and plums with a smooth campfire minerality for flavor. The maple syrup plays a strong and sweet role in the profile. Silty coffee and caramel, with some molasses are strong supporters. Silty coffee texture and covering with sweet caramel and roastiness teasing the tongue and inner cheeks. Sweet roasty sweetness of chocolate and coffee with vanilla and maple syrup highlights really define the flavor profile. 



M: Silty smooth texture on the mouthful with a equally smooth silty mouthful contribute and are equally as impressive. 



O: The syrup backing brings sweetness and depth, while the cinnamon spicing has a nice finishing and complimentary touch. Outstanding flavor and texture. Everything blends so beautifully together its almost unreal. Sweet milky-vanilla with maple syrup and a silty texture leads to an outstanding drinkability that is exceptionally smooth and extraordinary."

Lightly hazy orangey-gold, with about 1.5 fingers of pale orangey-tan head. Leaves behind about 1.25"" of 1/3 coverage streaky & spotty lacing, and a thin surface sheet, with a small mound of foam in the center. 



Smell is light candied orange rind, a vague mix of fresh citrus, a bit of light pine, and some fresh-biscuit malt aroma . 



Taste is a sweet orange rind flavor, but that of freshly-peeled orange rind that's been sweetened, rather that the usual dried /cooked[i.e., like marmalade] flavor. As such, it's also a bit sweeter than the usual too. Near finish, there's some faint pine, plus a touch of cooked sweet onion flavor (rather than the usual raw green onion). Very slight bitterness adds some balance towards finish, and lingers beyond. Brief, slight bread crust appears just as the liquid disappears. 



Feel is heavy-side-of-medium, which actually seems lighter I would expect, given the aroma,taste, and abv. Slight drying effect after finish. A light internal warming feeling shows up after two or three sips, but no alcohol heat on the palate, or at the back of the throat.



Overall, pretty good. Better than all but one TIPA that I've had* . A little sweeter than I prefer, but not TOO much. Dangerously easy-drinking. That said, other than as an abv delivery device, (if you want that) I still don't see anything to recommend it over the DIPA, or normal version.

O: 4.75. This is worth traveling to find. The hype is real for Lawson's. This may be their crown jewel."

I don't always knock points for style guidelines but I did here. Sure it's great and that's how they do things at Trillium but I like pale ales to be clear and crisp.

My first review of 2022! Yet another beer from my trade with merpunk1. This one is the highest rated Fruited Kettle Sour on BA, though it’s brewed more in the Berliner Weisse style, but whatever. It’s also currently sitting at #105 overall here, but I’m sure that’ll change soon given all the site updates as of late. Let’s pop this open



Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing



I really like what the guava does to this one in the nose, adding a nice funk. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe mango, funky guava, lemon juice, crackery malt, and light passion fruit



It’s even better in taste, still feeling unique in a world where this kind of thing is quite common. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon juice, funky guava, mango sorbet, crackery malt, passion fruit, and light orange juice. The swallow brings notes of tart passion fruit, orange juice, tart guava, apple skin, and pineapple



A light medium body pairs with aggressive tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and brisk beer. Finishes mostly dry and very tart



This is really good stuff, definitely worth trading for. I gotta get my hands on more of these J. Wakefield Berliners"

This smells like lemon, lactic acid, sweet mango, guava, passionfruit, and citrusy funk.



This was probably earth shattering 5-6 years ago, when nothing like this existed. As it exists now, it's just a pleasantly tart fruited berliner with a semi-restrained fruit character, at least compared with the smoothie overload most breweries are doing these days. It's very drinkable, and you could easily see taking down a whole bottle of it if you so needed to.



This is light bodied, crisp, clean, and pleasantly sour on the finish, with a very nice drinkability.



This is most certainly overhyped, but it's still a well done and enjoyable beer through and through."

This marvelous beer pours a wonderful raisin color with a harvest gold head of 1/4 finger. Recedes to a polite fingernail and stays. Swirling leaves a few micro legs.



Aroma is that of a really settled-in beer. Like this one has had some time to really develop and mature into what it is. Tons of wonderful aged dates and raisins, with shoe leather, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, and fig. Hints of chocolate, and a nice hot alcohol aroma envelopes the whole thing. 



Toffee and raisins start this one off, followed by a burnt char note and some piney hop, and then the sweetness returns with caramel and sticky fig, some paper/cardboard, and then fades out on tobacco and molasses. Very complex. A bit sharp and bitter, I'd prefer a little more smoothness, but this flavor profile is bonkers. 



Feel is sticky all the way to the bank with heat throughout but a cooling center. Moderate buzzing carbonation paired with warming alcohol that coats the gums and tongue. Leaves a bit of resin on the finish. 



Overall, this is a really wonderful barrel aged old ale and one I'd try to find again. I do believe I liked their BA stout better, but this is absolutely no slouch.

Make no mistake, this is a bitter beer. It demands an experienced drinker's palate, but rewards the garnered experience of a craft beer drinker with a beer that displays subtle citrus notes, a strong yet not overbearing malt backbone and a hoppy, piney, resinous kick that unashamedly proclaims its double IPA genes.

Continuing on with and nearing the end of my run of Russian River Wild Ales, we have the 9th highest rated of the style, and 104th overall. It seems that they’re really leaning heavily into the Americanized Lambic vibe with this one, so I’m interested to see if that holds true. Let’s find out



Pours a cloudy yellow gold with almost no head, just a ring of bubbles that leaves no lacing



Less than stellar looks aside, this one smells fantastic. I’m picking up on aromas of wet hay, white wine vinegar, acidic lemon juice, sharp oak, crackery malt, lime zest, white pepper, leather, and musty apple skin



Ok so the aroma was a knockout that had me expecting this to be super tart, but it leans into more of a restrained funk in taste. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting apple skin, straw, lemon zest, old wood, white grape, and flowers. The swallow brings notes of white pepper, wet hay, old leather, apple skin, white wine vinegar, and light bready malt. Really good but pales in comparison to the aroma



A medium body pairs with gentle acidic carbonation, resulting in a crisp and funky beer. Finishes very dry with a slight tartness



This is good, but I suspect that, for some reason, 2 years on it has mellowed it out far too much. Seems odd for a Lambic-inspired beer, but based on reviews of fresh bottle this seems to have lost its bite. I'd love to try it fresh one day though"

Intro: 375 mil. poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend. 



Appearance: Golden yellow to light orange in color. Minimal to no head



Smell: Acidic is the first term that comes to mind. Second term, dank



Taste: Followed along with the smell. Little to no carbonation. Tart citrusy taste.



Mouthfeel: Cuts through everything. Definitely a pucker up front but subsides as you drink.



Drink: Follows along with mouthfeel. Not something I could drink a lot of at any given time

I am a fan of Russian River, Pliny the Younger still eludes my taste buds. Living where I do, getting any beer worthy of writing home is difficult. I saw a bunch of Russian River's wild ales, I knew they had to come home with me. This is a sour beer aged in wine barrels. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a frothy white one-fingered head. The retention lasted maybe 15 seconds, leaving no lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 6, golden with amber hues. The beer is somewhat clear with a load of carbonation bubbles. 

Initial aromas in the beer are wine, funky barn, straw, damp earth, and lemons. Nosing further, I detect toasted crackers, horse blanket, oak, a hint of floral, and a touch of herbal. 



The flavors in the beer are lemons, chardonnay, funky barn, horse blankets, straw, wheat, toasted crackers, a touch of apple cider, herbal, floral, and champagne-like flavor. 



The mouthfeel of the beer is tart, tannic, and bright. 



The body of the beer is light, high carbonation, and medium finish. 



The beer has this explosion of sourness and funk. The wine barrel aging comes through pleasantly taking the edge off the sourness. I not sure if this my favorite offering from Russian River. This beer is a solid example of a wild ale, but I will not drink it again."
"1666819620-1294","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/","Beatification","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/27992/","Currently ranked #6 in the ""Wild Ale"" Top beers list and #70 in the Top Beers list with a perfect score of 100.



375ml brown glass bottle with hood-and-wire cap over a branded cork served chilled into a tulip (as indicated is ideal on the label and even on the cork). Bottled 04/03/20.



""100% spontaneously fermented beer aged in wine barrels."" ""Barrel aged 9 to 36 months"" (that's quite a spread...). ""...fermented beer using only wild yeast and bacteria."" 6.00% ABV.



HEAD: None really...just a floater ring that's rather thin and weak, dissipating in under 10 seconds.



BODY: Also a bit thin and weak, and certainly dull with a depleted and dareisay undercarbonated look.



I imagine I'm going to enjoy this beer, but we're kidding ourselves if this is a perfect 5 for appearance.



AROMA: Oak, barrel-derived vanillin, white wine, still cidre, obvious lactic acid. The bacterial aromatics are much more subdued than I imagined they'd be coming in...they register, but it's not teeming with lactobacillus like so many American brewed sour ales (I'm looking at you, Cascade Brewing). Doesn't seem as full of life and bacteria-ridden as, say, Allagash's coolship ales, but it's enticing with promises of ample barrel character, microfloral intricacy, and diverse bacteria.



I don't get any of that wet cardboard character one sometimes finds in well-meaning sour ales and I find no signs of infection. Some green apple, sure, suggesting perhaps acetobacter. No vomit-redolent aromatics that would indicate butyric acid are present.



Aromatic intensity is average for the style, maybe even a bit on the timid side. Doesn't scream acidity, but it does seem acidic judging by the aroma.



TASTE & TEXTURE: Zaps with mellow acidity and puckering yet mellow bacteria, hitting on all fronts (pediococcus, brettanomyces yeast, and lactobacillus. Not a lactobomb, yielding to the lactobacillus without letting it dominate the beer's flavour profile.



I can't shake the feeling this would be better fruited. Some source of added sweetness would help counter its dry acidity; this lacks the tartness that often accompanies sourness and I think it's worse for it.



Smooth, smacky, deliberately undercarbonated (and to good effect, I might add, evoking a fine Brittany still cidre), a bit wet up front and a bit dry mid-body.



Oak and concomitant woodsy flavours tie the brew together without feeling in-your-face, but I could do with more barrel flavour myself...I'd guess this particular 2020 batch was aged closer to the 9 month minimum than the 36 month maximum in their claimed range, and that much to its detriment. I don't get barrel vanillin per se or rich toasted oak, and the wine character is decidedly lacking in terms of depth of flavour. I mean there's faint white wine - perhaps muted Chardonnay or Riesling - but it's not as overt or nuanced as I'd like.



Green apple/apple skins, orchard fruit, lime, rustic barnyard funkiness from well attentuated brettanomyces, scatterings of microflora (none of them as interesting as what one would find in a Senne valley sour), vinegar/acetic acid, grass, hay, maybe some faint clove/spice from aged hops.



I suppose the bacteria dominate. Maltwise, I don't get much beyond 2-row and maybe a kiss of Cantillon-like cereal grains. Far from a sweet ale, and I do think it'd be better off fruited as noted above.



OVERALL: It's not a holy shit son of a bitch ""man, you've got to try this!"" sour ale, and it's not even Russian River's best wine barrel aged sour ale (I'd tend to favour Supplication in that respect), but as an American imitation of Cantillon's spontaneously fermented sour ales, there's no doubt it's rather good, if not quite up there with the Allagash efforts in the category. I don't know that I'd shell out for it again at this price, but I'm glad to have gotten to try it. A long-time want and a damn solid ale, but I don't know that it beats the pants off your typical Belgian gueuze - many of which are easier to find than this and even as imports cost the same if not a biteen less.



I'm an unabashed Russian River fanboy, but while it's certainly rather good, the creme da la creme this is not, and how anyone can give this an honest to God perfect 100 rating given its obvious appearance issues (and what I imagine is to many troublesome undercarbonation) is beyond me.

Fairly clear, amber color coming out of the bottle, settling to a deeper semi-translucent caramel once in the glass.

Taste is wonderfully........different. This is unlike any beer I can recall in recent memory. The cherries are remarkably present after 5 years, but the wine barrel combined with the earthy funk is what's really making this one interesting. Plenty of sweet malts up front, but then the funk emerges mid-palate and into the aftertaste. Fairly full bodied and lightly carbonated.

Last but most certainly not least in my lineup if Russian River Wilds is Supplication, the 8th highest rated of the style and 101st overall. It’s been a fun journey working through all of these, and I hope to drink them all again in the future. For now, let’s see what this one has to offer



Pours a opaque brownish orange with 2 fingers of off white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing



Wow, this is a full on assault in the nose and I’m loving it. I’m picking up on aromas of dark cherry, old leather, brown sugar, fresh oak, lemon yogurt, vanilla, rich red wine, light vinegar, caramel, and light plum



It is just so rich in taste, and not really the sour bomb you expect from the aroma. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, tangy red wine, fresh oak, lemon juice, toffee, apple skin, wet hay, and light cellar. The swallow brings notes of dark cherry, stewed dark fruit, red wine vinegar, blackberry, black pepper, brown bread, and pear skin



A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a tangy beer. Finishes slightly sticky but tart enough to cut through most of it



This is a fantastic beer. It's certainly one of (if not the) best Russian River Wilds I had in this run, and it swings in the same class as the best of the style. So delicious but I'm sad that I've finished my last bottle!"

Supplication

Russian River Brewing

Date: 21 November 2019

I will start my day with a wild ale; I have tried most of the sours from RRB, they have been phenomenal. I used a tulip glass; the temperature was 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and airy light tan head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left zero lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, dark amber with rusty orange hues. The beer is somewhat hazy. The appearance of the beer is beautiful. 

When I pulled the cork out, wine and oak aromas emitted. Nosing further in the glass, I detect sour apple cider, funky barn, horse blanket, cherries, toasted crackers, and leather. Smelling the beer several times, I sense floral ester, a touch of phenols, and a slight fruity sweetness. 

The beer's aromas are sharp but did do not relate to the taste. The flavors are brett, oak, vinous, sour apple cider, horse blanket, dankness, funky barnyard, herbal, hay, cherries, lightly toasted malts, leather, phenolic, and earthiness. 

The mouthfeel is astringent, tart, and dry. The body of the beer is medium-light, high carbonation, and delightfully long finish. 

This beer is incredible. One of the best sours I have consumed to date. I was bracing for the sourness to rip my palate apart; I got the latter, a delicate ballet on my tongue. Near perfect balance, nothing the beer is trying to outdo other flavors. I loved this beer!"

There was also something fruity on the nose. The first sip was very funky and dry. The Brett was on full display and not much else. Over the next few sips the beer came to life.

I mean I made an account and am here now because of it right? 



Served chilled in a frosted pint glass. Brick red-orange colored, Head Came less than 1/4 inch up when i poured. First sip slaps you in the mouth with a refreshing sour cherry taste but not too much to make you pucker, Mild notes of cream and white wine (from the pinot noir barrels im guessing), very light taste of grain (not yeasty though or overpowering) a bit of funkiness and overall extremely refreshing. Taste great all the way through to the end. Almost a fresh olive kind of taste imo, i think it'd pair well with a Topanade, seafood, grilled food & chimichurri or tapas. As I said best beer I've ever had and what introduced me to the beer conossuier world. Now I've got to try the rest of the line up at Russian river brewing Co! I've had other ""specialty beers"" and they never really moved me like this did. This one is definitely unforgettable.

Black. After a brief, wispy, half-bald head rises on the pour, it’s 100% gone two minutes later, looking still & sinister. A beer to drown your enemies in (but what a waste…maybe drown your friends?). The nose is coconut & endless malts. 



Medianoche – Coconut is thicker than my Sunday waffle batter. Borderline gummy chewable. Taste-wise it’s a simpler beer than I expected.

Extended cut of coconut, pinch of brown sugar, serious malty sweetness throughout. Given a 10:30 AM wakeup time & a couple hours I’d love to take one of these solo.

This is massively, absurdly flavorful. I can't pick all that much out of this, just heaps of bittersweet chocolate and coconut for the most part. I do get a little bourbon but no barrel character otherwise. Very enjoyable.

Oh man, we have quite the big boy here. A 21% on a Tuesday afternoon? What the hell am I doing? Well, I’m on vacation this week and today turned out to be a stormy day, so I figured it’s the perfect time to crack this beer I received in a BIF from the legendary @Eziel. I’m getting close to the end of what he sent me, and they’re all heavy hitters. Let’s see what this one is all about



Pours a very dark brown with a finger of light beige head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing



There’s a definite sweetness in the nose, but it’s wonderfully balanced given its size. I’m picking up on aromas of chocolate fudge, earthy bourbon, toasted oak, nougat, black cherry, sweet caramel, molasses, toasted hazelnut, and light vanilla



This one really packs a punch in taste, heavy booze and char fight for attention while a huge sweetness backs it all up. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting charred oak, cacao, sweet bourbon, red grape, marshmallow, sweet vanilla, molasses, toffee, light nutty malt, and black cherry. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, charred oak, nougat, cacao, black cherry, molasses, apple brandy, vanilla, sweet caramel, and nougat



A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky and slightly thick beer. Finishes mostly dry but boozy as all hell



There’s no 2 ways about it; this beer is incredible. So complex and hitting all the right notes. Perfect for a quiet day to myself hanging out outside while it rains"

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing.



This smells like charred oak, lots of bourbon, lots of vinous grape character, brandy, roasted malt, dark fruit.



This is a nice bridge between some of overtly wine based Black Tuesday variants, and the regular bourbon Black Tuesday. The grape brandy adds a pleasantly oaky vinous character, sweet, but finishes dry, with oaky char, marshmallow, dark chocolate, caramel, roast, and bourbon.



This is medium bodied, slightly thin as most Black Tuesday variants tend to be, with a lots of concentrated booziness. It’s not overwhelmingly boozy, but it really kind of does drink like a distilled stout liqueur.



I haven’t had much Bruery in a while, but this was definitely a fun beer to revisit this brewery with. It’s definitely something to share with a bunch of people, like 10 people, maybe, but it’s well done."

This will be a very emotional review. Normally for big milestones like this, rudzud would have some crazy beer to share, but that can't happen now. Instead this was one from our share box that we got from Hoarders, saving for a special day. He might not be here physically to share it with me, but he's here in spirit.



Pours basically with no head, whisp of fizzy bubbles disappears almost instantly, dark murky molasses brown color with no real light coming through, and legs for days



Nose brings lots of barrel and bourbon, lots of vanilla oak, a bit buttery oak, fresh bourbon barrel juice, a bit like my nose in a Glencairn glass with some decent bourbon, lots of dark malts under that, some roast and coffee, no char, loads of cocoa, dark chocolate, a little nougat candy bar, fudge, a bit of a chocolate syrup as well, a little alcohol



Taste super rich heavy malts and barrel, dark chocolate, raw cocoa, chocolate syrupy again, a bit of a candy bar with light nougat and caramel notes, some roast and coffee as well, more like a coffee syrup, barrel brings lots of vanilla again and fresh bourbon barrel juice, a little generic whiskey character but some raw sweet bourbon as well, getting fudgey in the middle, some toasted oak character and layers of vanilla, a touch of baking spice, med lighter bitterness mostly from the roasted malts, some hot alcohol not quite fusel but almost there, finishes sticky and coats the mouth, never really goes away, lingering cocoa, fudge, vanilla and generic whiskey



Mouth is full bod, rich syrupy and really coats the mouth, some hot tingly alcohol, med-light foamy carb



Overall quite nice, there have been better Bruery beers, but for a Black Tuesday variant adding the extra bourbon and barrel was nice, although I think it has dropped a bit from what it probably was fresh, but alcohol didn't destroy either as the age probably helped there. 



I swear I heard a pop sound from my glass while it was resting and I was typing. Matt must have taken his sip, and I hope he enjoyed it. Miss the great bottle shares and fun times. This was just one more milestone in my reviews. I know rudzud always joked about how he would never catch me in reviews, and I guess he was right. I'll keep drinking beers, but I'll always have that hole that will never be filled. Cheers Matt!"

Quickly fades, as expected, leaving behind only a thin ring of foam around the edge. Body is surprisingly clear and cola-colored.



Boozy nose - whoda thunkit? The smell of bourbon, port, and brown sugar wafts over you from the pour itself. Up close it's similar but stronger: red grape, molasses, chocolate, brown sugar, oak, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, honeycomb.



Strong, sweet, and boozy on the palate, with an alcoholic burn that grows and grows. Very slow sipper. Lasting heat in the throat and chest.



Incredibly deep and complex, rich and dark. Molasses, brown sugar, oak, bourbon mash, red grape, white bread, light toast, toffee, vanilla, espresso. Long aftertaste, although the booze understandably dissipates rather quickly."

Cocoa, molasses, cinnamon, baked oatmeal, sugar (demerara with hints of muscovado), tobacco, vanilla, and coconut in the nose. Sweet, complex, and balanced. 



The flavor follows the nose but is joined by a wave of chocolate covered cherries, plum torte, cloves, faint poblano, sweet hay, and more. Malty and rich with hints of toasted nuts and 'smores in addition to black licorice and cinnamon. Medium earthy finish with the base beer shining through like the best oatmeal cookie you've had. Hints of ceylon tea at times. Low bitterness throughout. Flavors are not quite integrated - curious how this would age.



Slick, oily, full-bodied mouthfeel, low tannins, and lush carbonation. Well hidden ABV.

Pours a nearly pitch-black color. Befitting a huge, barrel-aged monster, there isn't much head, just a tan collar topping it off. 



The aroma, though, is out of this world good. The focus here is on roasted malt, espresso, licorice, and baker's cocoa. A light touch of smoke gives it another layer of depth. There's a tiny hint of cinnamon lingering around, which is good: too much cinnamon would have hurt its chances at greatness. And of course, the assertive bourbon barrels can't be overlooked. Tons of oak, vanilla, and bit of corn shine through. 



While the taste doesn't follow the nose super-close, it's wonderful in its own way. It starts off with a nice, sweet cinnamon flavor lacking the bitter spice of other (frankly lesser) cinnamon-adorned beers. Same with the bourbony finish: it's subtle yet noticeable, without being massively assertive. Dark chocolate, espresso, roast, and licorice round out the middle - again, enough to make you think, but not enough to overpower. There's a ton of stuff going on with this one, and actually coalesces together into something harmonious and complex instead of complicated and sloppy. The more I consume, the more I love it, therefore it earns an elusive 5 taste-wise. 



It's not as texturally slick or slimy as other big oatmeal stouts, but by no means is it bone-dry. I could use a touch more body and thickness, but that's me nitpicking for the sake of picking nits. It's still as creamy and decadent as one could want from a monster barrel-aged stout. Carbonation is low, but it doesn't need much anyways since the oak tannins cleanse the palate decently. 



I'm always that guy saying beer X doesn't live up to the hype or wondering how the hell beer Y earned a 100. This, though, this lives up to the hype and then some. It's one of the most complex stouts I've ever sampled, and - like I said - isn't complex in a ""some is good, therefore too much is even better"" kind of way. It's wonderfully cohesive and well-rounded in a way stouts not even a fourth as deep are. An absolute masterpiece, seek it out yesterday!"

The beer pours a thick , jet black coffee color with a dense brown head foaming up about 2 cm and gently cresting over the edge of my glass. No spillage out and no light passing through either. Looks the part of an imperial stout for sure.

the dense creamy head fades slowly to a sturdy surface covering and leaves dense coating lattice on each sip or swirl of the glass.

The aroma on this beer is complex and enticing, there is some dark chocolate and a bit of roasted malts and almost charred note. I also definitely get cinnamon, but its not artificial like Big Red, very earthy cinnamon note. Also some bourbon notes come through here. I dont get licorice that is on the label, which is okay as I dont tend to like anice/licorice aroma or flavor too much. I dont get any booze here which is impressive at 13.3%. Also not much if anything for a hop profile on the nose.



First sip reveals a full, thick body with soft gentle and fine carbonation. Beer feels nice on my palate and does give a bit of a coating on my lips with each sip.

Flavor follows the notes advertised on the nose. I get dark chocolate and some bourbon with hints of dark chocolate rolling through. Some warming and earthy cinnamon pops up, and this flavor lingers along with a bit of warmth, or is THAT the abv which was hidden on the nose?? Not really any char or heavy roast notes here. The bourbon does come back very dominant on the burps. Hops, we dont need no stinkin hops! I dont get any on the flavor profile.

So the warmth could be booze or cinnamon, its not hot, just slightly warm.

The beer does drink pretty easy for its heft and I do enjoy it a lot. I got a second bottle of another beer to open after this, but I may just sip this one all night.

Very good brew!"

The aroma spoke more of bourbon than oatmeal, which is typical, (Oatmeal generally affects to feel more than the flavor for me in most cases) but I wasn't sure what to expect. The malts were very present, rich and deep. Strong coffee, cinnamon and bakers cocoa all made their appearance.

Taste followed, no new surprises awaited me except the sheer level of flavors that came at me. The prior BA stout today I could have (and would have) consumed a bomber of, but this one somehow go through to me rational mind that finishing it tonight would not be wise. So I'm testing the bottle sealer that so many have recommended.

Alright, I've obtained the highest rated Oatmeal Stout! This title used to of course belong to Founders Breakfast Stout, but the restructuring of BA rankings shifted it to this. I am very excited to dive into this massive beast, which is also my first beer from Fremont. Let's see what this is all about



Pours pitch black with 2 fingers of dark brown head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing



Oh man, even after 2 years the cinnamon in this thing is still super prevalent. I'm picking up on aromas of cinnamon bark, milk chocolate, caramel, toasted oak, spicy bourbon, light char and black licorice. Very earthy and raw



The earthy and spicy notes from the aroma is still present in taste, but it focuses much more on the smoother, somewhat sweet notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, fruity coffee, earthy cinnamon, caramel, toasted oak, and light raisin. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, spicy bourbon, dark chocolate, black licorice, dark cherry, molasses, and spent coffee beans



A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a creamy and lightly zesty beer. Finishes slightly sticky but dries over time. Decadent but not overly sweet



This is a fantastic beer. It is incredibly creamy, balanced, and complex. I would love to know what this is like fresh but this is a treat regardless"

Smell - nutty dark chocolate woody smell. I'm sure that nut smell comes from the coconut but I don't get the coconut, more just nut. maybe some molasses caramel deep in there

Taste - a little sweet but not overly sweet. dark chocolate some char woodiness along with the toasted coconut and vanilla. 

Feel - Medium full body with a medium light carb, slight creaminess

Overall - I like how the vanilla and coconut aren't overly done and instead just bring out some great flavors of the beer in different ways. The Barrel to this beer is fantastic. Well done not overly sweet BA Stout"

Before getting into the flavor, I greatly appreciate this brew being offered in 12 oz bottles. Though I enjoy drinking socially, I do most of my drinking solo, which makes those 16 oz plus bottles a challenge. That might be the wimpiest thing I've said this week. I should probably go start my lawnmower in one pull to make up for that. As for the flavor, both the coconut and vanilla come through, but hold back from dominating the flavor profile.

Smell - Dark chocolate was most prominent in the nose. Coconut was faint in the nose. 



Taste - Initially, the dark chocolate led the way. It was like a bourbon barrel aged Mounds bar. The chocolate and coconut worked so well together. The sweetness of the coconut was most prominent in back. The bourbon made for a warming finish.

Dark seal brown to bistre body with a thin fawn/camel collar. Vague lacing; fast running legs; poor retention. 



Vanilla, barrel char, bourbon, roast malt, and a hint of tobacco, molasses, cocoa, and toffee in the nose. 



Intense palate entry - all of the flavors above but concentrated. Rather sweet, with a long chocolate-laden finish. Some barrel/alcohol elements along with a gentle, clean bitterness add a little balance. Stewed dark fruit notes emerge as the ale warms. Neutral yeast character. Coconut and vanilla seem a little redundant, overwhelming their counterparts in the bourbon flavor, and reinforcing the borderline cloying impression.



Silky, almost oily, rich mouth-feel with active yet low carbonation. Moderately warming.

Pours pitch black with a finger of fizzy, dark mocha, almost reddish head that fizzes away almost instantly. When swirled, it coats the glass with a dark film.



Aroma is light coconut and even lighter vanilla as expected from the extended aging. This allows the base stout and barrel to shine more. Dark chocolate, black cherry, tobacco, roasted malt, some peat, and molasses from the base and some charred oak and bourbon from the barrel.



Taste brings more of the adjuncts than expected given the aroma, but they're still quite light given today's ""pastry stout"" standards. Toasted coconut and light vanilla bean dance in the background while the barrel treated stout is at the forefront. Bakers chocolate, some bittersweet chocolate chip, roasted malt, some peat, tobacco, black cherry, some fig, molasses, some brown sugar, charred oak, bourbon spirit. I'm sure there's some vanillin and even possibly some coconut coming from the barrel, but it's hard to tell if that character is from the adjuncts or the barrel.



Medium to high medium body. Slick, oily, sticky, warming. Could use a bit more body. Doesn't drink like 16%, but you know you're drinking a big beer.



I know I shouldn't have sat on this as long as I did because I'm sure there was a lot more coconut and vanilla character; however, the base and barrel integration are top notch and allowing the adjuncts to subside has shown this. It also has led to what I'd imagine is a smoother drinking experience than when it was fresher. I'm sure a fresher version of this would meet my expectations more, but this is still a very enjoyable beer at where it's currently at."

750ml bottle - blend 5 - poured into a chalice at 50°F. 



Pours a clear, deep straw-golden hue, with just a cast of unfiltered fog, and a finger of creamy, soft, off-white head, eventually settling to a thick collar leaving some lacing behind. Visible effervescence.



Nose: Soft, pale rustic grains, with crackery wheat and some round malted barley lend secondary notes of wet hay, dewy grass, and some dusty silo. There is some remarkable floral character, lending spring blossoms like lilac and hyacinth, with lemon blossom, wet stony minerality, and a lightly musty oakiness. Some very restrained white vinous notes, along with a touch of pear, apple, and apricot. Gentle hints of honey, lemon zest, and some phenolic peppery notes wrap it all up in a beautifully soft and rustic olfactory display.



Palate: Saison du Fermier greets the palate with simultaneous waves of gentle lemony tang, semi-sweet grist with some crackery, bready, and rustic grainy notes, and an explosion of bright, shimmery fruity notes. Lemon, nectarine, apricot, tart white plum, green apple, Asian pear, and a sweet-tart balance of fruity white grape. There's a bright but balanced minerality pushing these flavours to the front, along with some wet limestone. Some Belgian-like saison yeast brings that fruity, undertone with a bit of peppery spice intermingling with a touch of herbal hops. Finish is oaky, dry, and lightly tannic.



Mouthfeel/Body: It's on the lighter side of medium-bodied, with a tight, snappy crispness - bright and fluid, but there's enough grain to lend some softness and presence. Effervescence is incredibly lively and fizzy, but fine enough to stay soft and fluffy. Tart and wet up front, finishing with an increasingly dryness, and a touch of cling.



Overall: A lot of the fruited and more recent Side Project offerings have been trending more and more acidic, which can really bring it down fast. This one shows the balance and softness that I know they're capable of. It retains much of that classic Belgian saison character, while contributing the classic Side Project culture and grist character. Soft, balanced, bright, and absolutely dialed in. A top tier American oak-aged saison."

The flavor has tons of chocolate fudge and chocolate chip cookies. There's loads of Hazelnut coffee, toasted pecans and almonds, as well as bourbon, vanilla, oak, fig, plum and caramel. Boozy but at 12.3% this should be expected. A lot going on here but it all works perfectly together.



The feel is full bodied, chewy and syrupy. Almost no carbonation but plenty of booze, as expected.



Overall, I might be a Tree House fanboy but I've been quite critical of their stouts in recent years. They've become a bit too sweet with minimal balance. Just chocolate syrup.

Review #2100



Medium bodied dark brown/black appearance. Somewhat thinner in appearance and lighter in color than I anticipated. The beer was topped by a small cap of bubbly, cappuccino colored froth that quickly broke apart. A medium sized halo encircled the liquid.



The aroma was solid initially but somewhat subtle. Malty notes dominated. Roasted malts were most apparent. Good dose of caramel malt character too. Moderately sweet. Slightly smoky. Almost a touch peaty. Dark fruits were also detectable. Raisins, plums and figs perhaps. There was a bit of a papery oxidative quality as well, but this subsided with time. As the beer sat, the aroma intensified. The dark fruits, the sweetness and the smoke became notably punchier.



The flavor profile followed the nose. Rich and malty up front but less intense than anticipated. Nice melding of roasted and caramel malts. Slightly smoky. Boozy notes kicked in as the beer moved along the palate. Port soaked raisins came to mind. There was a bit of a chocolate/Tootsie Roll-like character too. Subtle metallic notes appeared on the back end, but they dissipated with time. More lingering booze and sweetness on the finish.



The mouthfeel was solid but thinner bodied for a beer of this magnitude. Smooth and slick on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, moderate effervescence that fluffed up nicely on the palate.



Tree House make some amazing adjuncted milk stouts, but their purely barrel-aged releases seem to be a bit lacking in intensity and mouthfeel. While this was an enjoyable beer, it did little to stand apart from the pack."

Alright, time for the highest rated American Strong Ale, which is quite the ambiguous style, but I’m excited regardless. Especially after having The Rusty Nail and knowing they excel at using cinnamon as an adjunct, I can’t wait to try this. Let’s get into it



Pours a very dark brown with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing



This is super cinnamon forward in the nose, almost too much but it’s still nice. I’m picking up on aromas of earthy cinnamon, cocoa powder, sweetened coffee, spicy whiskey, and toasted oak

Pours out a dark brown, nearly black liquid. Aggressive pour yields a half of a finger of khaki head. The foam sticks around for a while. It didn't look too thick on the way into the glass. Stouts just have a certain way of looking and you can guess that this might not be one.



Nose indicates that it's definitely not a stout. Coffee comes forward first, but not in your face with roasty qualities. There's actually a slight hint of sweet fruitiness that accompanies this coffee. Reminds me of Jamaican Blue with its delicate, fruit-forward tones. Next is the presence of molasses spice cookie. There's this mildly bitter, peppery, spicy sort of thing lurking underneath. It smells quite captivating so far, if a little on the weak side. 



Taste is everything that was in the nose and more. A natural evolution. Mildly roasty and fruity coffee, cinnamon, bitter black strap molasses, a faint bourbon/oak, black pepper, but without the heat, and dark grainy bread. Along the lines of rye or pumpernickel. I got that in the previous B-Bomb I had as well. Very unique quality. These flavors unravel spectacularly, never once stepping over each others toes or vying for attention. Nicely balanced, not too bitter, not sickly sweet. 



Mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth. Not thick like a stout, but a nice density. Not too cloying, alcohol evaporation drying it up a little. Mild carbonation.



Overall a fantastic brew for the winter. A great sipper to have with friends and to ponder life and enjoy a snowy winter landscape. Cheers to Fremont who continuously knocks it out of the park."

This is well rounded and wonderfully balanced overall. The barrel presence is magnificent, no surprise from Fremont, rich with bourbon and mellow vanilla with hints of oaky leather. I want my funeral pyre built with spent staves from Fremont barrels.



Under all that was creamy cocoa, dates and raisins, caramel, subtle coffee, and dessert like cinnamon. This is wonderful as is, but I hope I get to try a fresh bottle someday with more assertive coffee notes.



Now having 2018, aged and purchased under the same circumstances. This version was a few bucks cheaper for some reason. This was drier and a bit roastier. Less cinnamon and surprisingly more coffee maybe. Just a bit less decadent than the 2019.



Edit 4/1/22 got my wish, now enjoying a fresh 2022 bottle. The coffee is more assertive but so is the cinnamon. I'm also getting a strong coconut note. Huge barrel presence but the figs , cocoa, and raisins are subdued. It's wonderful now, but I think I'll age the other for a year or so."

L: pours a nice very dark black brown with a moderate tan khaki head. Fades after a minute or so, leaves a nice ring of foam around the edge when it does



S: nice and inviting nose, full without coming across heavy or sweet. Great chocolate aroma to open, solid roast coffee comes through as well. There’s a bit of cinnamon spice coming through as well, adds some nice complexity but doesn’t become a dominant note. A bit more cinnamon as it’s warmed, along with a small bit of abv heat



T: follows the nose well, a great dark chocolate note with dark roast coffee notes shining as well. That cinnamon comes through to add some nice depth, but again more playing a supporting role than really acting as a main flavor. This was as it was cold from the fridge - as it’s warmed that cinnamon comes through more, still not aggressive but a nice addition to the chocolate. Medium-long finish, with a nice bitter coffee/dark chocolate coming through. Abv works very well, provides that warming character without coming across hot

Pours a hazy, largely translucent dark orange body topped with two fingers of fluffy, slightly off-white foam; good head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, a slim, frothy collar, and myriad spattering of webby/spotty lacing strewn across the walls of the glass.



Aroma highlights dank orange oils and accents of sunflower petals/general florality upfront, leaving crackery malt lingering into soft, grassy resins glossing over soft lemon peel over time.



Taste features waxy peach zest within a resinous overlay as grapefruit steadily washes over a catty/peppery undertone; light moss and wilted mint over the mid-palate fade to residual pine past the finish.



Mouthfeel brings a medium body and a choppy fluff of moderate carbonation, dispersing dry textures and a pseudo-bittering over the mid-palate before eventually fading to a flaky crispness; a resinous glide brightens over the back end as bits of residual grit prickle the finish.



A warming aggression peeks through the stability of crackery malt and floral resins, an unforeseen grit waving across the normally clean Hill IPA profile; the subtle bittering and choppier tones of earth the result ultimately lend to a slightly more varied and intense profile to contrast the largely delicate base."

This smells like intensely resinous piney hops, grapefruit rind, booze, pineapple, and grapefruit.



This is definitely a bruiser, and easily the booziest HF IPA I've had, which makes a lot of sense. It's quite resinous and bitter, with lots of pine and earthiness. There is a lot of juicy and citrusy type things, too, as I get grapefruit, melon, pineapple, and some lemon. There's not too much malt character, but it does finish a touch boozy.



This is medium bodied, with an intense lingering bitterness, both from the hops and higher alchohol. Despite that, it's still pretty drinkable for me.

A clear light orange with a dense white head with excellent retention and lacing this looks great. The nose is super ripe, fruity, floral apricots with a lactic saison adjacent base. Delicately floral fruit notes, probably from the Pinot Noir casks, is present, though this doesn't have a real red wine character. Vanilla to go with ripe apricots. Awesome. The fruit expression is sublime. 



The palate opens with a blend of lactic tartness, mildly yogurt like with lots of fresh apricots. Just tons of it, though in a nuanced, delicate way rather than the unabashed abandon that's Fou'Foune. No real funk here, this is fruit and acidity in perfect harmony. Vanillin, delicately fruity Pinot Noir, a nice tannin character are all present. Drying, lactic, fruity on the finish with lots of lingering apricots. Tannins and a little grain round out the finish. SARA beers aspire for a higher ideal in the mouthfeel category, and this beer delivers. Light, airy, parfait-like with tons of fine carbonation, just enough to lift the fruit heavy beer but not so much that it's anywhere close to being foamy. Gentle, coaxing, prodding, this is a truly excellent beer.



In contrast to the fresh Fantasia I had a couple of nights back- this has more fruit, more sourness but less funk and less depth outside the fruit. They are both equally good interpretations of the style, and I can see my preference flip flopping."

Aroma features flaky malts introducing a softer pineapple into mango flesh and a resinous grapefruit interlude sparking a peaking bouquet, whereon transitional pine to fresh-cut grass on the back end remains synchronized to a peppery dank, lemon twist.



Taste opens to pineapple resins with a light tinge of tangerine pith, wrapped in an undertone of freshly sliced mango laden with grassy hop textures; a grapefruit twang over the mid-palate phases effortlessly into a lemony dank finish with flaky malt accents and distant hints of pine.



Mouthfeel offers a medium body with a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation; a wispy twang invigorates a vague bitterness over the mid-palate, trending sticky as pillowy resins take hold into the back end for a lush hop consistency, and a flaky crispness persists with drying undertones through the finish.

L: Eschews classic West Coast IPA visual with a slightly more opaque and deeper color than other classics of the style. Beautiful lacing on glass after some sips, yet head dissipates rather quickly. This has little bearing on the beer overall personally, a minor complaint. 

S: Lovely nose of tropical notes. Smells of fruit and citrus, not an overpoweringly strong scent yet clearly expresses the flavor profile to expect. 

T: Citrus and fruit flavor explodes here. Measured bitterness reminds that this is a West Coast IPA, yet has a juiciness that has come to be associated with NEIPAs nowadays. Hoppy and fruity, taste follows suit on the nose and then some. 

F: Perfectly measured medium body, finishes on the dry side yet the tropical fruit and citrus notes linger for some time. 

O: My third experience with Citra, I think I can conclude that this is my favorite West Coast IPA of them all. The juicier and sweeter characteristics of it as opposed to other notable examples of the style put it over the edge as a truly original and exciting beer.

F: Medium mouthfeel. Smooth on the palate. Medium carbonation.



O: The freshness of this four-day-old beer made for some incredible aromas and flavors. Extremely enjoyable."

Holy shit, I’ve finally found a fresh Alchemist drop nearby, and I wasn’t even actively looking. My local store managed to get some of this and Heady Topper. I got a few cans of each (HT is ready for a re-review, and I couldn’t be more psyched on it. Let’s see what this legendary beer is all about



Pours a hazy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing



This is super juicy in the nose, but also shows and incredible balance. I’m picking up on aromas of orange zest, bready malt, mango juice, peppery hops, pithy grapefruit, cantaloupe, pineapple juice, and light weed



While it’s very good in taste, it doesn’t carry that same balance displayed in the aroma. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe mango, orange zest, doughy malt, lemon zest, grassy hops, and light pineapple. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, bready malt, caramel, pineapple juice, grapefruit zest, peppery hops, and light weed



A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy yet crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with with a nice blend of fruit juice and weed



Well, the taste may have been a bit of a letdown, but overall this is a killer beer. I can’t wait to try more from The Alchemist"

The tropical nature and just dankness of the hops shines through even more. Where Heady Topper feels like I’m drinking hop resin, Focal Banger feels like I’m drinking fruit juice with a tinge of hops."

Aroma: Blueberries, mango, grapefruit, passionfruit, pine needles, peach, mandarins, raspberries, sweet bready malt, and some Cannabis

Taste: The palate assault begins with pithy citrus, pine sap, and ripe blueberries that immediately expand their breadth and depth. Soon after, Cannabis, tropical fruit, orange-led citrus, and raspberries start to catch up and mix with the initial hop notes and all happening upon a soft, sweet malt base. Slick hop oils and alpha acids come in waves throughout and closes with a bold bite, pine, and dank

Mouthfeel: Full, slick, medium-high carbonation, and medium strength dryness on the finish

Overall: This is a phenomenal beer. Having had this gem and it’s bigger, bolder cousin (Heady) both for the first time in the last week, I can say not only have I been blown away by both, but I would immediately be a convert to the NE-Style/hazy IPA if all of them were like this O.G. Such a great and almost unbelievably deep nose along with tons of flavor depth, some slickness, a bold bite, and dryness are all prominent here and everything I feel many iterations lack more often than not. I now understand the hype of this sub-style where it originated as well as realizing how many times that I’ve heard how good this beer is and now can finally say, I wholeheartedly agree"

Pours three massive fingers of supremely fluffy white head into my Willi glass. Retention is superb, after a few minutes all of the head is still here. Initial lacing looks great. Body is a cloudy yellow, reminiscent of a Witbier. Looks perfect so far.



Nose is soft tropical fruit, mandarin oranges, small dankness. There is a perceived sweetness, likely from the fruit. This smells good, elegant, I hope the fruit isn't too candi-like.



The dankness and fruit balance each other wonderfully on the flavor, with neither being overwhelming. Fruit is mostly soft - mandarin oranges, finishes with a citrus rind bite.



Carbonation is medium-low, a small hop bite adds some character. Body drinks relatively light, which is a welcome characteristic. Bitterness is medium-low. Sweetness mostly comes from the fruit, and isn't cloying. Overall a pretty classic mouthfeel for a classic hazy.



Drinkability is pretty high. It's not cloying, or too bitter.



Appearance turned out wonderful. Lacing was thick all the way down, and a small island of foam remained till the end.



Overall a solid classic. Balanced and flavorful."

Focal Banger

The Alchemist

New England IPA

ABV: 7%

Date: 05/03/2022

I was given this beer by one of my good friends. I have already consumed a few; they are tasty. Served in a tulip glass at around 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and creamy two-fingered head with above-average retention. The head is bright white, leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. The color is pale straw with hues of light gold, charting beer around SRM 4. This beer is hazy, and little yeasty friends are just floating around. The appearance of the beer is above average. 

Tangerines, lightly floral, with hints of pineapple, pears, and peaches, are the hops aromas. The malt profile is lightly toasted bread crust, cereal grains, and a touch of crackers. Other aromas are grass, wet dew, and yeasty. 

The hop profile is the star of this beer. The hops flavors I taste are tangerine, a hint of pine, a touch of orange peel, pineapple, mango, pears, some floral, and a touch of passionfruit. The malt body is light yet stiff enough to hold the hops in check. Other flavors I detect are lightly toasted bread crust, crackers, a hint of minerals, a touch phenolic, and grassy. 

The mouthfeel is dry and crisp with medium carbonation. The body is medium, and it finishes tannic and long. 

An amazing beer! When I drink NEIPA, this is the standard which I hold other beer. Now I am talking about the balance, flavor profile, and a deft hand in creating this work of art. I wished I lived closer to this brewery, I would have a constant stock of their beer in my fridge."

Poured from a 16 oz. can into a pint glass (I know what it says on the can, but I like looking at my beer!!!) , this beer features a very pale yellow hazy color with a good size foamy white head and plenty of lacing. Head retention is good. Aroma and taste remind me of Heady Topper in that the aroma cascade out of the can as soon as you open it!!! Lots of grapefruit and pine in the nose and taste. More pronounced ""dankness"" than Heady Topper and I detected kind of a mild tobacco taste that I did not detect in Heady Topper. Mouthfeel is rich, bitter and crisp. A great beer!!!!"

A clear copper with a dense, white head with good retention and minimal lacing, this looks solid. The nose is pretty excellent. Insanely funky with preserved lemon, earth, mushroom, petrichor, light honey, floral orange blossoms, grapefruit pith. The dry, dusty, mineraly funk is just awesome. Dried mushroom for days. Delicate elderflower funk notes are present.



The palate opens tart and lactic, a blend of earthy and mushroomy funk, complementing the sourness quite well. The sourness is reserved, not only for the style, but also given the age and the fact that this is an older de Garde. Remarkably well balanced, there are undercurrents of peach and pear. The funk on the palate is just fantastic, with layers of earth, leather, mushroom, cobwebs and must, and yes, some horseblanket as well. Drying, tart on the finish with a moderate carbonation, flavors of earth and mushroom linger. Highly recommended, especially for fans of the funk. Truly old world like."

There was a canned date of 04/19/22 @ 05:59:33 on the bottom of the can. I bought this at the brewery, and drank about 2 months from purchase.



Appearance: Deep gold color with 2-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.



Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.



Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.



Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 8.2% listed on the can.



This is an excellent New England IPA. It has a nice mix of citrus, hops, and other flavors, which makes it enjoyable. Another outstanding IPA from Tree House. I like the overall balance, and would buy this again."

A: The beer is a very hazy dark gold color, with a large white head that fades quickly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.



S: The aroma contains strong juicy citrus and tropical fruits, floral and dank hops and light caramelized malts.



T: The taste likewise starts out with strong sweet and juicy flavors of citrus and tropical fruits. Then a strong but not over-powering floral and dank hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is hoppy and sweet.



M: Very crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean for the style.



O: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not too filling, well-disguised kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent 2NEIPA to drink for a very long time."

This beer is an imperial version of Alter Ego, which is one of their only flagship NEIPAs that I have not tried yet, so I can't draw any comparisons there. However, I have had Doubleganger, the extra hopped variant of this and enjoyed it quite a bit



Pours a hazy pale yellow with 3 fingers of rocky white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing



There is a perfect blend of tropical fruit and dank herbal hops in the nose, quite unlike any beer of theirs or any IPA really, almost an earthy perfume vibe that oddly reminds me of the smell of a church. I'm picking up on aromas of orange juice, creamy peach, juicy papaya, pithy grapefruit, grassy hops, dank herbs, a bit of onion, and doughy malt to hold it all together



Herbaceous vibes from the nose translate well into taste but with less intensity, allowing for greater balance which bumps up my rating. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy papaya, mango, overripe grapefruit, light pine, and a creamy malt. The swallow brings notes of herbal hops, creamy malt, tangerine, and underripe cantaloupe



A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a very creamy beer that coats the mouth on the way down. Finishes somewhere between dry and slick



This one was interesting for sure. Way more herbs than I usually get in a TH beer, and for uniqueness alone I have to bump up the overall score. Really good stuff here!"

S: A mix of tropical fruit and citrus up front along with a dose of dank and earthy undertones



T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the tropical fruit and citrus, quickly followed up by the dank, herbal, and earthy tones. Moderate bitterness. Finishes with lingering tropical fruit and citrus



M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth



O: A very good imperial version of Alter Ego that really hits with both the juicy and dank notes. Very easy to drink. Definitely worth checking out"

Notes via stream of consciousness: A two finger thick head of off-white rests atop a murky golden body with an orange sheen. The aroma isn't as strong as I expected but it delivers some orange and passionfruit over a sweetish and grainy malt base. The flavor is bright and vibrant with a clear note of tangerine backed by passionfruit, nectarine, apricot, and mango. The malt is delicately sweetish, bready, and lightly oat-like. The bitterness is moderate and yet it finishes dry due at least in part to some hop acidity. In the mouth it's medium bodied but it feels a little fuller due to all of the extra proteins giving it a fluffy feel. It's smooth but that hop burn gives it a little bit of an edge. The head has held up really well and I've still got a creamy, but more importanty complete, surface covering. The lacing covers quite a bit and looks like a drawing of trees out of a book of scary stories. The aroma is better on their ""Very Hazy"", and I've scored it better overall, but for my money I prefer this easier drinking version.

An interesting aroma; like a sage / cucumber mix; faint bit of citrus. The taste follows along the lines of the smell; stronger sense of cucumber rind bitterness; biscuit-like malt flavor. Heavy body; moderate acidity; somewhat juicy, somewhat dry on the palate.



All I can say is the smell and taste are weird. I don't recall tasting anything like this. If there is supposed to be a stronger citrus presence, it's missing in this sample. If anything, the hop profile seems like some weird combination of Motueka and Nelson Savin hops. Motueka has never thrilled me, but Nelson Savin can be very interesting. Still, there must be a reason it (currently) has a 100 score on BA, but I certainly don't understand it.

Notes via stream of consciousness: A finger's width of off-white foam tops a murky golden/brass colored body. The head appears to be holding quite well. The aroma is fairly mild for an NEIPA but offers up passionfruit, nectarine, and a light touch of citrus. The taste is fuller and more complex with notes of orange, pineapple, juicy apple, and distant lemon/lime. The malt is basic, most likely with 2-row, wheat, and oats although I can't specifically taste the wheat or oats. A solid bitterness backs it and it finishes dry with some quickly passing fruit that leaves a soft grassiness, bitterness, and ""hop bite"" lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gentle caress on the tongue. It's fluffy and smooth with plenty of proteins. The head held up really well and it's left some very interesting to look at lace all around the glass. All in all I don't think that Green is Treehouse's best beer by any stretch but it's a solid, well balanced, and highly drinkable beer.

Bought at brewery.

Canned 8 days prior to review.

Quite frothy, quickly dissipating, white head. Fairly murky, medium orange with some amber overtones, to the look. Mango, guava, candied tangelo peel, a little medium roast caramel malt, emerges out of the mix. Seems like there is a whiff of some nutmeg/allspice, or such, buried deep in the aroma. A nice melange of some Mandarin orange peel, a bit of medium light toasted malt, underlying, and a whiff of guava/passion fruit, deep in the taste somewhere. There is some lightness to this beer and it finishes mainly with a little tingly, glowing, Mandarin orange/tangelo peel bite. Definitely well done."

The barrel is significant here. Mature, spicy, peppery, and lightly charred with a caramel and even spiced rum character to it. This compliments the maple well, while tempering the decadence of the mocha, vanilla and coconut, which is like a swirling creme anglaise throughout."

We’re nearing the end of the BIF beers I got from @Eziel back in February, and this one is a heavy hitter. This has been a big want for me for a while, so it’s awesome to finally be able to try it. Let’s see what this famoud spicy Stout is really all about



Pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of reddish brown head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing



This is highly complex in the nose, not too peppery and balanced in its sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nibs, vanilla bean, chili pepper, spicy whiskey, burnt coffee, sweet toffee, brown sugar, and light charred oak



This is a bit restrained in taste, perhaps due to the age but I still really enjoy it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark chocolate, roasty coffee, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, cinnamon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, caramel, toasted oak, earthy whiskey, and burnt coffee



A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and earthy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a lingering heat



While I enjoyed this, I’d hardly put it on legendary status. Again, maybe it’s the age so I’d love to try it fresh, but even still"

Pours very dark with no light shining through, next to no cap or lacing.



Dark chocolate and fudge brownies on the sniff.



Super smooth, nice complexity exhibited by the notes of more chocolate/brownies/cinnamon/dark malts.



Delicious creation, no doubt aided by a few years in the bottle....get some of this fine nectar, if ya have the opportunity."

750ml bottle - poured into a balloon stem at 50°F. Huge thanks to DonnieT79 for this longtime want!



Pours an unbelievable slick jet black colour - absorbing every photon of light, with the single darkest head on a beer that I've ever seen, forming - like a grade school volcano, it foams up - fine and sudsy, with the colour of light coffee beans, and then receding to a huge, persistent coarse bubbly collar that lasts forever. 4.75



Nose: Incredibly rich. Almost like a concentrate. Deep, bold roasted malts with a particularly Russian-style accord lend bitter baker's chocolate, cacao, Peruvian coffee, black treacle, toffee, caramel, marzipan, and vanilla. A slight, dense fruity thread lends a deep raisiny PX sherry note, with a hint of fig, blueberry, and dried cherry. I'm failing to pick up any chilies or cinnamon, but there is a unique warm spice element, lending a hint of earthiness. Not very Mexican, but it smells delicious. 4.25



Palate: The legendary Hunahpu greets the palate with an expertly dialed-in balance between malt sweetness and roast. Immediately, it lets you know that it is not trying to be a Mexican wedding cake - this is a Russian imperial stout, with a bold, heavy roast, deep, dark, bitter complexion, and leaning drier on the sweetness scale. Roasty is the main theme here. Bitter cocoa, charred malts, burned sugar, and burned vanilla lead the way, with an underpinning of marzipan and malty sweetness. The pepper is there if you really squint, but rather than lending a chili heat, it's more of an earthy, dry spice. Spice as in spices, not heat. I'm not picking up on cinnamon, perhaps due to its age, but there's definitely some type of spice character that's lending an earthy aromatic quality. It grows drier, nudging out any sweetness, and the charred malt takes hold, upping the dry, bitter factor. The faintest little glow of pepper warmth emerges, and the stout concludes with deep, bitter roast, cacao, and an almost tannic bite to it, which lingers, resurfacing with an espresso- like aftertaste. 4.0



Mouthfeel/Body: Despite its foreboding motor oil appearance, Hunahpu is quite drinkable. A bold, rich, heavy brew, but he's quite fluid, with a medium-full body, and very minimal viscosity. There's some fine, subtle fizzy effervescence, but it's relegated to the background, and only just contributes enough. The chilies warm only the gums, and it concludes with a drying, tannic roasty squeeze. 4.25



Overall: This is a tricky one for me. I know this is revered as a legend, and was once highly sought-after, and perhaps the age didn't treat this one the best, but I have a hard time falling in love with it. It's a bit roasty and bitter for my taste, and feel it trends more in the classic Russian style than anything else. It's a great RIS, especially if you like them bitter and roasty, and the hint of pepper is a nice twist, but I keep,wishing that it were just a touch sweeter, less roasty, with more caramel/toffee/vanilla/malt, and less cacao/char/blackened bite. I can certainly see how the right person would adore this though. I just find the roast a bit overbearing.  3.75"

She's upset this is 25 oz and she thinks i should only be drinking a bomber a night, which is 22 oz. So this experience begins with stress and tension. And a couple eye rolls. I purchased this from a private seller for $40, which is probably way too much to pay but i can't get this around here in Ohio, and I'd heard so much about this beer i had to try it. So every whale has its price i suppose. Glad to be trying a beer from Tampa as I've been watching some interviews toady with Shock G, AKA Humpty Hump, about the history of hip hop, and he's from Tampa. Poured up deep dark brown with a darkly tan one inch head, a shade darker than khaki. It quickly dissipated into a floating ring around the glass. To be honest, this smells like wet metal, iron, blood. And a little chocolate, dark berry, and thick dark sugary things like molasses. I'm actually getting a lot of plum from this taste, plum and raisin and dates. More plum than ""Plum Tuckered out"" by Hoppin Frog. Very sweet, heavy and dark. A little burned tasting. Slight cinnamon, bittersweet chocolate, a bit of vanilla on the back end. Although the description says there's some Scoville units on this one, I can't detect any spiciness whatsoever. Mouthfeel is medium thick with moderate effervescence. Overall, it is very good, but i am not as thoroughly impressed as i expected to be. This is rated 100 on this website, and i think it tastes really good, but I'm not going to be that generous, as i don't think there's anything particularly unique about the brew. Maybe i'm just sullied by my wife's remarks and hope she just goes in and smokes a big bowl so she can get high and forget about the fact i'm drinking this whole thing tonight. So much for $40. Maybe better luck next time."

Outstanding aroma; tropical fruit sweetness with a rich bitter chocolate element; chili peppers. The taste multiplies the smell sensations; chili pepper spiciness with cinnamon overtones; cocoa and bitter chocolate; star anise. Heavy body; slick and oily on the palate; warm with chili heat and boozy warmth; sticky residual sugars coat the palate and offset the warmth notes with a sweet mouthfeel quality.



2020 edition, unknown ABV (the 2021 version is 11.8% ABV). This beer was made available to me out of the blue, and what treat this is. Many chili and high ABV beers suffer in the head retention department, and that seems to be the case hear, but everything climbs to a high degree afterwards in the sensory appeal department. This is one awesome imperial stout augmented with a devilish chili pepper kick."

Its nose features roasted malt, caramel, cocoa, cinnamon, freshly-brewed coffee, tobacco smoke, dark fruit, peppers, and subtle but distinct bourbon. The flavor is ridiculous! It opens with cocoa and coffee, along with mellow peppers, black cherry, and cinnamon. All the flavors are delicate and they blend beautifully. The bourbon notes are subtle and enhance the other flavors. It's so easy to drink. The mouth feel is creamy and remarkably lite for 10.2% .

Mouth: It's like chewing a beer - you know it's in your mouth and it doesn't disappoint. There's high carbonation that leaves a lot of carbonic prickling on the tongue and in the throat, and on the swallow there's a warning kick, presumably from the hops. Awesome.

Smell is both more oaky and peppery than regularly OG, a little dusty even, but also brighter and spicier, in a pleasant, sense-awakening way. Adding to the allure are hints of dried, gooey apricot, fresh fig and white grape.



The medium body's lively effervescence perks up the palate, again with surprisingly bright, zippy characteristics. It's super refreshing and also very pleasantly balanced on the palate, quaffable to a frightening degree, particularly for a bottle so hard to find.



It's like a mimosa with white grape juice instead of orange, while very fine white oak adds complementary complexity without any undesirable features, and barely a touch of funk. Again here it's more peppery, yet not as toasty as regular OG, but it simultaneously gives a feel like you can crunch down on it before the frothy light carbonation dies into a perfectly clean, semi-dry swallow. It consistently reminds me of nelson, my favorite hop.

16oz can served in a stemless wineglass. Dated 01/25/22. Received from @WunderLlama in NBS BIF #14.



Pours super murky whitish yellow with a medium sized head that dissipates into a medium sized ring and a fairly large but thin island of fine bubbles in the center of the glass. Smell...well, for starters I been catching whiffs of it for where I set it, arm's length away (and I have long arms). Smell is gorgeously tropical juicy, pineapple/mango/orange. Lingering resin sense that is difficult to extricate from the tropical juicy stuff.



Taste is much pithier / redolent of fruit skin than the aroma suggests. It's bitter up front, lots of resin, and the tropical juiciness is strong but lurking not-so-subtly in the background.



Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry / drying, slightly gritty. This is a very good beer."

Look: Pours a pale, but somehow full and hazy yellow with a large-pored white head that dissipates quickly without leaving any lacing. No floaters.

Taste: Yellow citrus fruits. Fresh and hoppy. Zesty and bitter body with a dry finish. Low sweetness.



Feel: Very juicy with a medium carbonation and a sharp zesty punch.



Overall: Full and juicy Pale Ale with a strong focus on fresh citrus fruits. Could easily be mistaken for a DIPA. Very challenging compared to other Pale Ales with its full body and its dry finish. Great beer. Very intense."

Notes via stream of consciousness: A very hazy, or rather, cloudy golden body rests beneath a massive head of slightly off white foam. It's three fingers thick at this point and holding quite well so I may have to wait a minute to take a sip. In the nose I'm getting plenty of citrus including grapefruit, perhaps some orange, and some other tropical fruits as well although they're not quite clear. OK, the head has settled so let me give it a taste... ahhh, that's nice, it's got a nice combination of malt and hop, and a firm bitterness to back it. I think there's even a little bit of hop burn there. The malt is sweetish, bready, and even lightly honeyish making it a great base for the hops to bounce off of. The grapefruit remains but it's not the dominant note anymore, and I'm getting more peach and other tropical fruits. There's some melon, a hint of lime, mango, passionfruit... ... and... lychee. I love lychee! It's a little weird eating a fruit that kind of feels like an eyeball but when they're perfectly ripe they're absolutely delicious. It's fairly floral as well, mostly coming out in the finish. I get a mild alcohol presence. How strong is this? ... ... ... There's nothing on the label. Doesn't matter. I think it's nicely balanced, and I am definitely getting some hop burn. I could probably drink about ten of these in a row. Only kidding, but I feel like it has that kind of drinkability. Alright, let me wrap this up. The body is medium on the higher end, or at least it appear that way due to all of the extra proteins in it, and it's gently crisp and then smooth across the palate. I'll definitely be looking for more of this. Oh, I almost forgot, although the head has great retention - I'm still looking at an eight of an inch of solid surface covering - the lacing falls behind. I think it still scores a 4.25 because the head retention is so good but with a little more lacing it could have hit a 4.5.

But over the past few months theyve all been hit or miss. And for $20 a 4 pack it hurts when you miss. Then i came back to an old favorite--Toppling Golliath. its got just about everything i like about all these beers, everything i hope for every time i by the new weekly. BUT HERES THE THING. King Sue has ""it"" every time. Real big fresh hoppy tones (citra) but so fresh, like they use real hops vs canned or dried hops if i had to guess. The pale ale version pseudo sue is just as good."

It is a clear, reddish plum pour with half a finger of pure white head. It looks less thick than many of the HF saisons I have tried, but ""prettier"".



Tart plum bursts from the bottle and fills the room. As I pour it gets even stronger. My salivary glands fire before I even put nose to glass. Such a delicious aroma, it calls, entices, with fresh plum, tart sourdough, raspberry jam, grape must notes, honeysuckle, hints of spicy alcohol and fresh flowers, in perfect balance to create a stunning aroma.



All the flavors of the nose are here, no need to repeat them, balanced perfectly, in a wonderful blend. It ends a lightly jammy whih fades into a tart, fruity linger. As it warms hints of an herbal bitterness enter the mix, quite lightly, and it gets even better.



Medium body for style, light carbonation which works well here, clean as a whistle, with a brilliantly flavored linger that is just right to bring on desire for next sip.



Another masterpiece from the master I regret not tasting fresh. It has either remained or become a beauty of a beer that is an artistic work of intoxicating refreshment"

375ml bottle - 2018 vintage - poured into a wide tulip at 44°F. 



Pours a clear, yet ever-so-slightly foggy true gold hue, with all but a loose ring of white foam forming, that sticks around permanently. Some lazy effervescence is visible. 



Nose: In classic Hill Farmstead form, the aroma is beautifully delicate and fragile, beginning with subtle notes of malt and wheat, with a rustic sort of grainy note about it. Atop this, gentle acidity and beautiful minerality act as a conduit for a melange of bright vinous fruits in the form of lemon, pear, apple, nectarine, white grape, and gooseberry, and then this subtle, yet spectacular dark fruit note that is quietly jammy, sweet, and plummet, almost evoking a hint of grape juice and grape pixie stix. Finally, threads of oak, hay, grass, attic, leather, parchment, wet moss, and petrichor stitch it a together. Absolutely spectacular. 



Palate: Immediately, the defining notes of the base beer - Florence, are beautifully showcased here, rounded by maturity. She greets the palate with the most restrained acidity with a hint of lemon-lime, and then that unique floral, fresh coriander-eucalyptus note peaks through. Bright fresh fruity notes of pear, gooseberry, white wine grape, underripe plum, and tart plum skins all play together, surrounded by a racey, vibrant minerality that sparkles over the palate. There is a subtle thread of funk, lending damp earth, moss, hay, wet oak, white grape pomace, river stones, and a whisper if dusty brett, before the lemon-lime and exotic fruity floral notes resurface. A slight minty/camphoraceous element cools the palate, and then the oak comes in to dry out the fruity bits. Flora Plum finishes dry and clean, with a faint hint of grain, and zero acidity. 



Mouthfeel/Body: Delicate, light, and crisp, yet managing to avoid being watery or lacking in any way. Perfect gentle acidity, which is complimented by a zippy, sparkling minerality, and lively, but delicate effervescence. Perfectly dry with just a hint of fruity sweetness and plum-skin tartness. Subtle drying oak, and as clean as you could imagine. 



Overall: This is a truly spectacular farmhouse ale. I thought blueberry was divine, yet I believe this exceeds it - and I'm a sucker for blueberry. It's just so delicate, elegant, and tasteful, while truly conveying all the character of Florence, softened by oak and time, and delivering this subtle, but beautiful fruity plum influence. There's a reason this beer is so highly revered. Practically flawless, and utterly Hill Farmstead."

The nose has faint, mildly dusty oak pairing with a pleasantly subtle floral perfume that's just hypnotizing.



Uniquely and cleanly juicy, a lightly herbal, drupe-influenced sort of pear character with just a kiss of tartness is dreamily weaved throughout the zippy effervescence of its satisfyingly palate massaging medium-light body before coming to a vanishing semi-dry swallow.



Flora Plum is such a perfectly quaffable yet delicately complex brew, it's beyond words. I love being floored by subtly delicate complexity like this. The experience is pure, even without a discernible Hill expression. It seems to even transcend that already high bar."

Pours a stunningly vivid, blood-red hue sporting deep ruby highlights along with a short-lived finger of fluffy, soft magenta foam; a few islands of paper-thin cap are temporarily encompassed by an equally thin collar and minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass with any longevity.



Aroma is awash in fresh raspberry jam as silky vanillins underscore a gentle funk; wisps of Sangiovese impress an increasingly juicy red grape must, while oaky, lacto-funk evolves in turn over time.



Taste brings raspberry jam cut with a level lacto-funk upfront; red Jolly Rancher is eased with subtle dry oak imparting red wine tannins and subtle minerality over the mid-palate and into the back end, where musty, wet basement undertones are interspersed along the finish.



Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body with a subdued, moderate carbonation; a glossy lacto-cooling washes waves of funky brightness over the palate, while a tannic wetness lingers on the back end, drying quietly into the close.



Jammy raspberry reverberates through a tannic silk and soft, funky underscore, leaving a wild ale perceptively hybridized by waves of dense fruit saturating rustic subtleties; a playfully approachable complexity throughout."

Overall, big and bold, with a clear and intentional focus on coconut, as the label would suggest. It's a soothing pillow of coconut.

The viscosity is delightful; other Imperial Stouts are so thin and weak by comparison. And the complexity is amazing. I introduce people to it every year, give them a small glassful without introduction and ask them what they think they are drinking. People are always fascinated by the range of flavors, and only a few guess that it is a beer!

Look: Very dark, and is about as translucent as used Diesel motor oil, which is to say it is quite opaque. It is a very dark brown in color, with a medium brown head. 



Smell and taste: Bourbon (of course), chocolate, tobacco, some dried hay, some smoke but not a lot. and more and more roasted loveliness. The alcohol burn is there, but it really just transports all of the flavors to the nose and tongue and is not overly intrusive. Everything is balanced, which is a characteristic of all of my favorite beers. Take a sip, and contemplate all of the different flavors as they dance across your tongue from start to finish, front to back. There is a lot of variety here. 



Feel: As at least one other review mentions, for its massive burst of robust, intense flavor, it is not a thick beer, but is surprisingly thin. It is not a make-or-break for the beer, just an interesting characteristic. ""



Overall: One of my top 10 beers (The old bomber Karbach BBHs, La Fin Du Monde, Avery Reverend, Aventinus, Real Ale Sisyphus, Avery Maharaja, Ranger Creek Wee Heavy, any dark ale from Double Mountain in Oregon, New Belgium Ranger Imperial IPA)



I always drink these out of a Bordeaux style wine glass since it concentrates the scent of the beer. I usually pour one right out of the fridge and drink it slowly over an hour or so, savoring the considerable shifts in flavor as it warms up. The coffee and the chocolate notes become more predominant, and the complexity bursts forth. The finish also becomes more Aventinus like and will linger on the tongue as long as you want it to. There is a strange stage about 20 minutes in when a burnt nut bitterness becomes more apparent amongst all of the other flavors. But, fret not, just wait and it will revert back to its full palate. 



I don't love my favorite beers because they score high on this site. I love them because they are fantastic. This is a fantastic beer."

This beer is so dark, the foam appears to be a dark brown rather than the the typical white. This appearance is how you know this will be a serious stout.



S: There are definitely notes of bourbon in the aroma. You can also detect notes of roasted barley and oak.



T: The taste of this brew is suburb for an imperial stout. There is a rich blend of flavors from the oak, the bourbon and the malts. While there is also some hop presence, its really the bourbon that takes center stage here. This is definitely the gold standard for a barreled aged beer. 



M: The mouth feel is very warming. That is to be expected at with a beer with a big abv like this one. This is definitely something you want to drink in the colder weather,



O: Overall Goose island nailed this style. I don't often give 5 star ratings but this brew earned it. It is such a rich imperial stout that drinks very smoothly. It is one of the best beers I have ever drank. Final rating 5/5."

Live review. Poured from the 1 pint, 0.9 ounce bottle that I found at a cool bottle shop in Mentor, Ohio about 18 months ago for, if I recall correctly, about $15. 2019 indicated on the neck label. Drink by: 25 AUG 24 08:33 14.7% ALC/VOL printed on the lower part of the label on the body of the bottle.

A: The look does not disappoint. The darkest body with a brief dark brown head which lasts about 10 seconds and I poured generously into a clean, clear snifter. Love this look, even if much of it is to style. 4.5

S: Dark fruits predominate without too much “heat” of alcohol which I expected somewhat due to the high ABV. I certainly pick up some deep, sweet bourbon notes but the dark fruits are front and center. Intriguing and I give it “extra credit” for not being too “hot.” 4.5

T: Wow. So much going on here. Early taste is a LOT of dark fruits, heat of alcohol bourbon notes dancing on my tongue and then dissipating into a long, slow, alcohol slide out to an amazing finish of smooth dark roast malt but that process takes about 2 minutes. 4.5

M: Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for the style and the beer’s reputation. Mind you, this is NOT a thin beer, just that I had expected one of the fullest, thickest beers but it is not. 3.5

D: Drinkability/Overall: Overall a fantastic beer, one that everyone reading this should seek out. Drinkability is limited by your budget and your sobriety but this is a “night capper” kind of beer. Only a fool would drink several of these in one evening. Intention, in my opinion, is to enjoy one of these in an evening, and frankly share it with someone else. 4.0"

Pouring this from a 16.9 oz bottle, the pour produces a nice finger or so of tan head that dissipates after a few minutes. A bit of lace is left around the edge, with light head left bubbling in the middle. Overall a very dark, nearly black pour gives off a strong boozy scent not uncommon in barrel-aged stouts. The aroma is also quite sweet, which for me is always a good sign of a stout with a good body and careful construction. So far, so good.



The first taste is very, very heavy on the tongue. This is an Imperial Stout with a lot going on. It sticks to the inside of your mouth like a stout should and has a sweet-hot initial hit, likely thanks to the very high ABV of 14%. There is a certain candy flavor up front that I am not a huge fan of, but it doesn't stay around for long. Afterward the taste dissolves into almost a cola-like flavor that lingers for a long time. It feels like there are a ton of flavors, including coffee and dried fruit that almost overwhelm anything else. 



This is a fine beer. It isn't my favorite stout of all time, but it is an American Imperial Stout, and is amongst the most well-crafted I have ever had. I can see this being someone's go-too Stout when it's in season, but the flavor profile is just a little too sweet for me. 



Still, very good."

Look: deep brown, nearly black, with a light coffee colored head. Delightful

Smell: IMO this is the best part of the KBS. Comes off almost like a Mexican hot chocolate with deep chocolate notes, some small cinnamon hints. Booziness apparent from the scent.

Taste: Matches the smell nearly to a T. Heavy alcohol heat throughout with the chocolate notes brightening as it leaves your mouth. Just like a barrel stout should be. Quite sweet, but even as someone who doesn’t love sweet beers, it’s great.

Feel: Carbonation is quite low, so the combination of the stout density and boozy heat creates a rather unique, slick feel in the mouth. High sugar content seems to be enhanced by the slick feel.

Overall: King of barrel aged stouts for me. Great stuff"

Bottled 12/4/2021 poured straight from the fridge into a frosted glass. Started around 48° and it was very closed up. Still able to get all the main notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and bourbon, but they were nowhere near as strong until the beer warmed up. My favorite temp was about 55-60° but I sipped until it hit closer to 70°



Overall: Incredible stout. Loads of separate flavors that all come together perfectly! 



L: pitch black color, can’t even see light coming through when held up to a lamp. Toasted brown head with good retention and lacing from top to bottom. 



S: at first I got more chocolate than anything else, but as the beer warmed up 5-10° I got a much darker chocolate and strong coffee notes followed by bourbon on the end. Chocolate heavy overall 



T:cold straight from the fridge at 48° I got some coffee and chocolate and maybe some black licorice with a heavy hit of alcohol at the end. As the beer warmed up the alcohol completely disappeared. Strong coffee flavor followed by dark chocolate and some nice bitterness that you would get from a nice piece of dark chocolate. Bourbon follows on the aftertaste. Slightly sweet at first with a bitter ending. Some roasted malt, but coffee and chocolate are by far the strongest notes. 



F: low carbonation, thicker and slightly creamy without being overly heavy. Very smooth"

Taste: Definitely tasting the heavy chocolate, coffee and bourbon. The initial taste is coffee, followed by the taste of coffee, finishing with the bourbon after taste. Very nice!!!!

Feel: Getting light carbonation - very smooth. Very well hides the alcohol.

L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass at roughly 55 degrees. The beer pours a dark black opaque. Very thin film of tan head which quickly faded to bubbles. The thin head only leaves moderate lacing.



S - The roasted coffee comes up front with a slight hint of chocolate. Not much else. It's pretty much straight-up coffee smell.



T - The coffee roast comes up front, then fades to a chocolate. There’s a little bit of cola flavor there too. The flavor is then balanced with a slight bourbon at the end. Aftertaste is a mild coffee roast. Toward the end of the beer though, the coffee notes fade a little and the chocolate notes take center stage. The taste is much more complex and pleasing than the smell.



F - The carbonation is almost like a cola. Smooth texture overall. Easy to drink. 



O - Again, I tried this a week after trying Founders Oatmeal Stout. From memory, they are very similar. (Not sure about side-by-side comparison.) As I stated in that previous review, I do not like coffee. Taste or smell. But these were so highly regarded that I had to try them. I still don’t prefer the coffee taste, but this is still a great beer. Very smooth flavors that go together well. The 12% alcohol did not make this boozy at all. It was all flavor and no sign of high alcohol. I personally won’t try this again, but for a coffee drinker, this would be a fantastic beer.



Again, in all honestly, I don't like coffee one bit. The smell, the taste, all of it. But after the initial coffee hit, this was a great beer with balanced flavors. I don't see myself seeking this out in the future, but I'm glad I tried it, and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to any coffee-loving friends in the future."

Alright folks, here we are, the final BIF beer I received from @Eziel! It’s been a wild 6 months of hard to find beers, and we’re ending with the heaviest hitter of the bunch. This is currently the 5th highest rated Saison on BA and 52nd overall. Those are some impressive stats. Also, I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen a beer fruited with only nectarine, it’s usually a blend. Let’s get into it



Pours an opaque orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that very quickly fizzes away to nothing and leaves no lacing



Sheesh, less than stellar appearance aside, this is bold in the nose, just super fruity and tart with a big funk too. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet nectarine, wet hay, tart apricot, sharp oak, lemon yogurt, wildflower honey, straw, and crackery malt



Oh man, the funk is even punchier in taste, but not in a way that's out of balance. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart peach, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, stone, sharp oak, nectarine, wet hay, honey, and lemongrass. The swallow brings notes of wet hay, stone, white wine vinegar, peach pit, nectarine, sharp oak, crackery malt, lemon yogurt, and light orange juice



A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp and zippy beer. Finishes bone dry with a lovely balance of sour fruit and funk



Wow, this is one hell of a beer! It's highly complex, yet I could chug it. But why would I do that? I plan on nursing this bottle over the course of the night"

The neck films a shade of macaroon cream that’s dismissive per inscription, from the preset retention. Howbeit, an irksomeness to turns offers lace docility, as the intervals thermally protract. There’s a touch of transparency upon the settlements of course, while effervescence becomes a mobilized variance 



S: Pierced rusticity for white peach with esterification authorities. Illustrated by, a bitingly tart eruption that’s tamed enough for the developing – wild yeast – appearances. The progression opts for some grainy malt to the motivated horsed phenols, which quietly idle funk steps. Principally, satchels and farmstalls with soiled mold. Nonetheless, acidity is tenacious on fruit bouquets, as the lactic stability is detrimental to frowzy quirks. There’s elements of solvency thru the open air drafts, which incriminate nail polish and naphtha agents. On the other hand, that piece is often stupefied, given the peppery phenol attunement to floral hops, and biscuit-y malt brackets to stone fruit minerals



T: A clean, consecutive, punch-down stomp that puts natural peaches in vanguard. Notations subtly follow in ripening depictions of Goldrich apricots and Armking nectarines, while briny minerals perimeter Neptune grass. In correlation, an engine for Eugenol to promptly pump in cloves and nutmeg, while maintaining that peppery attenuation. The ongoing drive is earthy and persistently bright, with calming acidity on the advances of rural funk. To that end, the move adds haystacks atop the citrus connotations, but keeps that musty jazz in a distant place. Aerial attacks begin setting in, from oak dragged elasticities, and prompt in some leathery satchels. Whilst, Chardonnay attenuates a staleness for Budapestlängd with an oxidative nuttiness



M: Does not puncture with puckered acridity, but rather maintains a level of energy that rationally aids. Namely, a backend for rustic brettanomyces, and a pillar for biscuit-y grains. The approach is brisk in carbonation, as the approach is crisp in sensation. Thus, cleanly bright with minor overextensions in the presetting bites, but pleasingly uplifting in the dry – erosional – reliefs



O: Showcases clean peach natures with a caustic effervescence that’s costly to the preliminary entwines, of wild yeast. Though, development is rapid enough to calm the impaling authorities, and make rational moves. In this situation, light malts provide an aid to earthy hop kicks, while acclimating spiced esters with musty phenols. The approach is thereby tart with brett funk complexions, and spurs wooded fruit tannins on an astutely dry/crisp exhibition"

Blend 4 (aka Vintage 2020)



A: Pops and is a gusher which is inexcusable as this has sat undisturbed for months. Several ounces wasted and sedimentation disturbed from the bottom. Color is apricot yellow/orange with a fizzy white head that dissipates almost instantaneously. Once that’s gone it actually looks flat. It’s quite hazy, nearly opaque. Certainly not much of a looker. 



S: Aroma is a great balance of fruit sweetness and tart sour characters. Huge fruit flesh characters with big peach as expected but also tangerine and apricot. Lactic acidity and sour citrus to balance, I would say the tart/sour characters are moderate on the nose. A bit of melting plastic like funk and mineral notes round it out. 



T: Taste is very delicious. Much more sour than the nose, with huge puckering tartness. Wonderful sweet fruit notes to balance, it’s very orange-family fruit forward with notes of oranges, tangerines, nectarines. Peace is primarily on the finish, but is quite nice. Pretty big lemon tartness as well. Really fantastic. 



M/D: Mouthfeel is fuller bodied, carbonation is appropriately high even though it looks flat in the glass, drinkability is very good.



O: Overall, this is an excellent beer, no doubt. Although #37 overall rating on BA seems damn high. Fair or not, I always compare these American Wild Ales to traditional Lambics, and even very well done ones such as this tend to lack the depth and complexities of most offerings from the likes of 3F and Cantillon. Regardless, still a treat, and would happily drink any day of the week. 



Happy New Year BA’s!

wish I could say the same about the taste - I feel like this could be used as an effective cleaning product. there is definitely a robust and complex peach flavor that is very impressive, but the overwhelming dryness and acidity detracts from that and probably drowns out some of the more subtle complexity. getting some grainy character and hints of vinegar, white grape and vanilla. don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this beer, but it was sour and acidic to the point of almost being harsh ...

Batch 4 (2020) 375ml - poured into a tulip at 42°F.



Pours a moderately foggy sunglow orange, not dissimilar to the peach on the label. A thin, coarse, broken off-white head almost forms, before quickly falling, leaving only a razor-thin collar, and constant streams of effervescence. 4.25



Nose: Signature Side Project pale base, with evident crackery grains, a touch of malt, and some dusty silo. The peaches are restrained - apparent, but not loud, lending a very organic white peach aroma, much like nectarine. The acidity translates as fresh lemon juice, and just a splash of apple cider vinegar - tame, and bright. There is a ton of wet white oak - woody and musty, playing with some funky wet hay, raw honey, stone cellar, dusty attic, leather, parchment, honeysuckle, lilac, dried leaves, and peach blossoms. Not aggressive funky or tart.



Palate: Fuzzy greets the palate with a quick flash of tartness - lactic and acetic in nature, lending some lemon juice and apple cider vinegar. The peaches, once more, are very natural and ripe, but not jammy. These are fruity, bright white peaches, with most of their fructose fermented out. Huge stone fruit notes of peach, nectarine, apricot, and a big plum presence. Remarkably floral, with honeysuckle, lilac, gardenia, and even a hint of honeydew melon. As the acidity curves, oak begins to show, along with a hint of sweet grain, which adds nice balance. Some farmhouse notes of hay, wet wet, stone, and earth emerge, providing that true wild touch, with the brett adding a nice dusty, sweaty, overripe element. It finishes remarkably clean, with a general stone fruit presence behind a fading acidity, some subtle grain, and drying wet white oak, with nothing really lingering.



Mouthfeel/Body: It's incredible how Side Project can produce these 8% ABV wild ales with such clean, crisp, snappy fluidity. Fuzzy is light-bodied, with no real malt weight, and quite dry, with no significant residual sugars. Perhaps a touch less sparkling than champagne, but with a similar feel - airy, clean, bright, and snappy. Acidity is tart - sour, even, but definitely shy of puckering. The finish has some nice drying tannic oak. Ultra-clean.



Overall: Fuzzy is a bottle with a lofty reputation. Long considered one of the finest fruited wild ales. That's a tall order. Is it the greatest wild ale I've ever had? I wouldn't say so. Is it the greatest peach sour I've ever had? Most likely. What it most certainly is, is the definition of Side Project. Yes, it is one of the more sour offerings, using their high acid blonde base, but it isn't overbearing, and it's one of the more subtle offerings - beautifully showcases the delicate nuance and balance that they're so great at. The tartness, the minerality, the organic nature of the fruit, the oak, the gentle funk, all meticulously blended. It really is a world-class wild ale, and one everyone should try at some point."

As we slowly worked through a collection of Hill bottles this evening, we started with shelf bottles and transitioned into sacrificing a few wine barrel aged versions. The progression is beautifully subtle, while the difference in appearance between them is pretty stark. Ann has much less visible carbonation than Anna, with only a short bubbly collar on top of a shimmering clear burnt amber body. This has closer to a honey appearance, whereas Anna is a hazier, paler yellow, with a larger, fluffier white head.



The aging process has cleaned her up quite a bit more than I was expecting, delivering a delicate experience that is less funky, yet more woody. White grape, riesling wine, and even notes of buttery chardonney develop as it finishes just barely dry, falling off the palate quickly. There's a hint of green olive, and it's only mildly sour, with essentially no funkiness at all. This is possibly the most wine-like experience I've gotten out of a beer. So much so we were contemplating opening a bottle of white wine to compare. It even sweetens up over time.



Ann is absurdly refined and complex, yet exceedingly simple. It does not have the body of the other wonderful Farmstead beers, and while I love it, I think in the long run that slaying a whale such as this puts into perspective just how fantastic the base beer is, as well as all the other HF shelfies, which are just so supple, easy to enjoy, and complex in their own right.

Maman 2020 is a blend of 2 distinct threads. The first consisting of base stout aged 22 months in Heaven Hill barrels, this comprises 80% of the blend. The remaining 20% is base stout aged 27 months on Weller barrels. We tasted through a couple dozen barrels to find a blend that best exemplifies our beloved barrel aged stout, Maman. Oak, maple, marshmallow, and caramel all dominate the aroma, with waves of rich brownie batter fudge and Heath bars wrap up the palate. We always strive for a balance of flavors in our beers, and we feel the nuance and surprising drinkability make this vintage of Maman something we’re immensely proud of.



This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.



This smells like high quality chocolate truffles, cookie dough, brownies, vanilla, spicy oak, caramelly bourbon, English toffee, marshmallow, heavy roast, and light smoke.



This has been high on my list of ""must-tries"" for a long time, and it really did meet my expectations. It's a pure expression of the power of barrel - you could tell me this has chocolate or vanilla or caramel added to it, and I'd believe you. There's very little booze here, and there's great oaky complexity on the back end helping keep things balanced. There's some definite roast and bitterness - it's not just pure pastry here. 



This is medium bodied, not the thickest stout ever, but that honestly helps here - keeping it light on its feet and very drinkable. There's barely any booze to this.



It's hard to find much to fault this one for. It's truly excellent - barrel aged chocolate marshmallow chunk brownies, essentially."

Glowing orange-gold body of haze and near-murk — pure juice. Big head of compact, off-white bubbles. Absolutely scoopable and creamy looking. Fantastic lacing.



Heavy sweet tropical fruits on the nose, balanced with lovely floral and herbal notes, breadiness, and a slight bite of pine. Familiar Juicy Fruit characteristics of a big TH hazy, but also a yeasty element. Each whiff is a little different than the last.



Taste follows on the very front of the sip but is then overwhelmed by a starchy green element, which takes it down several notches. Still heavy tropical fruit, very juicy, with a nice semi-sweetness. The grassiness overshadows any breadiness or pine characteristics that might be present. The can describes a sharp but pleasant finish, which I was hoping meant a nice bitterness.

Notes via stream of consciousness: This is a more intense version of their ""doppelganger"". An inch and a quarter of off-white foam tops a murky golden colored body with an orange sheen. The head appears to be holding quite well so far, falling in a little bit and become rocky looking. The aroma is pretty bright with notes of orange, berries, other tropical fruit, apple, hops resins, and pine. The taste keeps it going with additional notes of mango, honeydew melon, pssionfruit, and grapefruit. The malt is sweetish and bready, supporting the hop notes. A moderate bitterness and a fair amount of acidic ""hop bite"" balance it and it finishes dry with some fruit, resin, earth, and pine lingering. The head has held up really well and the lacing is fantastic. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gently crisp carbonation and a little zest from all of the hop acids, and then smooth towards the finish because of all the extra proteins. This one is really nicely balanced.

Look: Pours a hazy dark orange with a fluffy and stable white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. No floaters.



Smell: A combination of ripe orange and tropical mango and pineapple. Hoppy, dank and sweet. A bit sharp.



Taste: Citrusy notes of orange, tangerine and grapefruit with subtle tropical hints. Not as sweet es the smell suggests. Zesty, bitter and slightly sharp.



Feel: Very juicy. Medium carbonation. Smooth and silky.



Overall: Even though smell and look were almost perfect right from the beginning, it took a bit for the taste to fully develop.

10/06/22

Served in a Tree House Brewing Company teku



Outstanding appearance. The beer poured a nearly opaque, pale straw yellow hue and was topped by a frothy, finger-tall, bright white crown that slowly dropped to a lasting film. A wall of streaky, drippy lacing blanketed the glass and stuck until the drink’s end.



The aroma was fantastically hoppy and bright. Peach and apricot notes came through big time. Loads of citrus as well. Juicy orange and orange peel notes were most apparent. Good dose of mango too. Honeydew melon was also detectable, along with the signature Tree House bubble gum-like yeast character. Some alcohol appeared as the beer sat.



The flavor profile was nearly as stellar as the nose. Juicy citrus notes dominated on the front end. Like the aroma, orange and orange peel were noticeable. Peach and apricot appeared as the beer moved along the palate. Some honeydew melon too. Pithy orange rind notes came through again on the back end and in the finish. Moderate amount of lingering bitterness.



The mouthfeel was super soft and supple. Medium bodied for the style. The liquid contained a finely beaded, ultra mellow effervescence that worked nicely.



Very HHHazyyy is an other terrific double IPA in the Tree House catalog, though perhaps not too different from many of their other top-rated hoppy beers. I would gladly drink this again, but I probably would not actively seek it out."

Pours an almost turbid golden burnt orange body capped with two fingers of lush, fluffy, white foam; good head retention yields a thin layer of cap, a hearty, expansive collar, and generous spread of webby/spotty lacing coating the walls of the glass.



Aroma opens to deeply floral citrus refined to fresh orange juice accents and a fluffy lime underlay; papaya rind and soft melon ease over the middle as tinges of black peppercorn phased effortlessly into flaky, plush malt profile on the back end of the bouquet.



Taste shows mango upfront grazed with pineapple tart transitioning to lemon meringue against a fluffy malt base over the mid-palate; melon touches the back end, a briefly sweet interlude as musty grass and delicate, underripe passionfruit and grapefruit finish.



Mouthfeel offers a medium body with a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation, dispersing a hoppy twang fusing to juiciness over the mid-palate; the back end highlights a zesty character invigorating a taut, drying finish.



Waves of stimulation texture effortlessly attenuated character, seeing a pillowy malt profile support zesty citrus and pangs of sweeter tropical nectar in playful contrast; common with Hill's DIPAs, stimulating yet universally approachable displays."

Here we are, review #1300!! For this milestone review, I obtained the absolutely legendary Westy 12, the highest rated Quad on BA and #46 overall. A long time want of mine (over 3 years), so I finally decided to pull the trigger and get some shipped from Belgium. This is not as fresh as I hoped to try it, but I’m sure it hasn’t faded all that much. Let’s get into it



Pours a cloudy medium brown/red with 2 fingers of creamy light tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing



It’s super fruity in the nose, with a huge booze and yeast complexity to it. I’m picking up on aromas of red grape, dates, brown sugar, port wine, nutty malt, earthy toffee, molasses, clove, and light red apple



Oh man, in taste it is much more malt driven, but it’s still plenty fruity and complex. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting pumpernickel, red grape, sweet caramel, peppercorn, baked apple, brown sugar, clove, toasted nuts, and light port wine. The swallow brings notes of sweet booze, raisin, molasses, brown sugar, pumpernickel, port wine, clove, baked apple, leather, and light tobacco



A medium full body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer. Finishes slightly with a huge complexity that dries over time

The proprietor told me there were a number hidden away in the fridge to see if anyone found them and realised what they were. I sure as hell did! This review is based on some hastily scribbled notes, so might be somewhat sparse in comparison to the complexity presented by this wonderful beer. The beer was drunk in April 2022.



In the glass, the beer presents a burnt, muddy brown, pushing towards over-ripe, bruised plum in colour. There's a thin, off-white head. 



The aroma is dark cherries, brown sugar, plum, red fruits, dark cherry and Christmas cake. 



The taste is complex and ever-changing. There are dark fruits, red fruits, brown sugar and booze at first, and as the beer warms it moves to liqueur, cough syrup, sweet licorice and dark Christmas cake, with the booze backing off. There is almost certainly more peeking through, but everything intermingles so well together it's hard to identify specific notes in the overall melange.



The mouthfeel is full and smooth.



Overall, there's a reason this is so sought after. It's my second-highest-rated beer on Untappd (behind KBS) and, without looking, I suspect it will be my highest on BA. It's also the most expensive beer I've ever bought, coming in at around $55AUD for a 330ml bottle, which is about $48 more than an average beer! Nevertheless, it's grabbed without hesitation every time I see it.



Cheers!"

It gets even better with a few years age on it if stored properly with existing molasses and chocolate undertones coming out in full force. There is a reason why this is a top rated bier for decades and not just because it is difficult to obtain."

330mL (best by 10/13/2019, so bottled 10/13/2016) into a Westmalle chalice. 



Pours a clean deep reddish-brown mahogany with minimal white head, slow steady carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Evenly distributed particulates of yeasty sediment in suspension throughout the liquid are illuminated by overhead light. 



Aroma is bready and sweet, dryly fruity. Dates and figs, cinnamon and other spices, brown sugar/caramel, light tobacco—so many smells intermingle like wafting smoke, constantly changing. Not strong or powerful, just wonderfully complex and deep. 



Taste is likewise sweet and sugary, with so many layers of flavor to pick apart. Brown sugar; rum-soaked dates, figs, and prunes; candi sugar; warm yeasty bread; smoky leather/pipe tobacco. Just a touch of warming alcohol as it goes down—given the high ABV it’s well hidden. 



Mouthfeel is wonderfully deep and full, with gently prickly carbonation that allows the beer to dance on the palate without ever getting heavy or syrupy. Finishes semi-dry and clean. Just right. 



Overall just an outstanding beer, obviously one of the best within its style if not overall one of the best beers in production. World class. 

___________________________________________



Below is my previous review from 10/6/2011, for posterity:



Rating 4.52/5 (look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5)



330mL bottle (best by 8/29/2010 on the cap) poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Mahogany brown color with a thin fizzy head that dissipates quickly - nice carbonation continues to rise to the surface.



Aroma is dark fruits, figs, dates, brown sugar, spice, rum, and a hint of molasses. Smells exquisite.



Taste is rich and complex. Sweet dark caramel malt, spice, booze, figs, and raisins. Super smooth, chewy mouthfeel. Fills every taste bud with a complex blend of flavors.



This beer totally lives up to the hype. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the head - but this beer is also 4+ years old, which may account for that. If I try another one I'll make sure to get it fresh.



(Note: This tasting was done side-by-side with Rochefort 10 and I found this beer just ever so slightly more impressive on the aroma and mouthfeel. Otherwise they were very close.)"

The 12 is a monster. Tried many tripels/quads from St. Bernardus, Chimay, La Trappe and others (mostly on tap) the same week, but the depth and complexity of this one is a step above. Pours dark, light head without much density, not a huge nose. Creamy mouthfeel. Not malt-forward, heavy but balanced, with background flavors of raisin, leather, brown sugar, ginger and clove, and a surprisingly short finish and just a bit of bite. Small sips provide revelation after revelation. If you can ignore the hype and the crazy prices on the secondary market, this is 100% worthy of all the praise."
"1666819731-1792","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/","Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/313/1545/","Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with a ruby red hue when held up against the light and a medium, fluffy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, dark fruit and estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana clove and allspice, as well as just a hint of brown sugar. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt and dark, estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of chocolate, brown sugar and licorice. Finishes with a medium sweetness and some estery fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and low/medium carbonation.



While I didn't want to admit it, simply due to the ridiculous secondary price, this certainly is one of the finest Quads that I've ever had. I still don't think that it's worth 5 times the price of Rochefort or Bernadus Quadruple, but from memory it does stand just slightly above these simply due to balance and body/mouthfeel. The balance of sweet and spicy notes really is excellent here, with a very rich estery character, body and mouthfeel. Overall, this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quad that may not be worth its secondary price, but still stands on it's own incredibly well, with the ABV hardly being noticeable at all. I think that it's the richness, smoothness and balance which makes this stand just slightly above similar offerings, but from a value-for-money standpoint I'd still rather have a Rochefort 10."

I purchased six bottles dated ""12.10.24"" which I understand to mean they were bottled on October 12, 2021 and the ""best by"" date is three years after bottling or October 12, 2024. I also received a bottle dated ""19.01.14"" which means it was bottled on January 19, 2011 and the ""best by"" date is January 19, 2014. I purchased these bottles online on December 10, 2021 at westvleterenshop.com for $228.70 USD (Beer $149.00, Shipping $72.99, tax $6.71). The scores will be for the new bottle but I will include a review after for the old bottle just for fun complete with scores.



APPEARANCE: pours a dark, brown color with two fingers tan head that slowly dissipated until only a ring of small bubbles remained around the rim of glass, I swirled the bottle before final pour so there are larger bits of sediment that fell to bottom of glass, surprisingly the beer is not highly carbonated, it's not flat but maybe less than average carbonation, there is light lacing on the glass.



SMELL: dark fruits like fig and raisin, there is some black licorice and chocolate, bread, the 10.2% alcohol is clearly present.



TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially bread, figs and raisins, black licorice and chocolate, the alcohol is also present, less sweet than some other beers in this style.



PALATE: lower carbonation gave this a more creamy mouthfeel.



OVERALL: to me this is not the ""best beer in the world"", it's not even the best Quad, it's a good beer don't misunderstand, I enjoyed this beer immensely and would be pleased to have it again if I'm ever in Belgium but I will never pay $228.70 USD to drink this again, I can think of two Quads I like better, Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus and they are way more affordable, my opinion is that the scarcity and high cost of this beer has created an undeserved amount of hype and influenced people to score it higher that it deserves, I do not regret buying this beer, I can always make more money, I would recommend to anyone in Belgium but would not recommend anyone pay $228.70 to obtain this good not great beer.



Look 3.5 Smell 3.75 Taste 4 Feel 3.50 Overall 4



APPEARANCE: pours a dark brown color with very little head that dissipated quickly until there was no head remaining, I swirled the bottle on the last pour, there was very little sediment in the bottom, lower carbonation but it's still present after almost 11 years, no lacing on the glass.



SMELL: initially sweet brown sugar and an earthy note of figs and raisins, I can't perceive the alcohol at all, not as complex on the nose as a more recent bottle.



TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet brown sugar, the earthy note is dominant but there are figs and raisins, less complex than a more recent bottle.



PALATE: very low carbonation and creamy mouthfeel.



OVERALL: I would not recommend aging any beer as long as 11 years, the biggest issue is carbonation will begin to fail, the complexity is degraded, the alcohol was less noticeable but the pleasant aspects of the taste are diminished as well, I would not recommend aging, I know you can but, it's not as good, I would drink this beer as soon as possible."

The taste, wow; while it pretty much followed the aroma, the layers and power of flavors is impressive. Stone fruit mingling with biscuit like malts and they made an excellent pair.

This 330ml bottle, part of a limited, labeled, North American release a few years ago, had a best before date that I couldn't read. Poured into 12oz tulip. Poured the expected and anticipated very deep chestnut of the style, with about a half-inch tan head that dissipated at a moderate pace and left no lacing.



The aroma had all the big stone fruit scents one expects, solid, earthy grains, and a touch of yeast spice and esters. Maybe, just maybe, a touch of alcohol heat as well.



On the tongue, all those aspects were apparent, just amplified. The fruitiness was bolder, the malts stronger, the yeast had more bite, and there was certainly a bit of alcohol heat at the back end.



The body, while full, was a bit lighter than I was expecting, making the beer float over the palate rather than flooding it. The finish wasn't nearly as sweet as I would have thought, and dried out quickly.



Drinkability was awesome, you could easily drink a couple of these without getting bored.

This is my 2,000th beer rating/review so it had to something with the prospect of wowing me; fingers crossed... 

L- Dark chestnut red-brown. Pours with minor haze with some sediment left in the bottle. Head forms swiftly, take the pour slowly. 3Cm pale tan head. ps@+10mins a patch of bubbles holds the whole way down. 

S- Quite malty with a light hint of spice.

T- Woah!! Ok, well THAT got my attention. Instantly deep and roasty-rich, notable ABV% brushing my palate and a good balancing hoppy-bitter aspect into the finish.

F- Big, rich + 'visible' ABV% but well balanced by hops.

O- Made for slow-sipping. Lovely, complex and big yet mostly refined. The ABV% is unusually loud for 10.2% and that surprises me. (I had an 18.1% yesterday less shouty on the palate than this one). FWIW I'm tasting this on a clean palate. My wife tried it after eating chocolate and didn't get the ABV-zing. Nice. Would I drink it again? Yes if I could drive to the brewery and buy it for peanuts.

Poured cold to a champagne coup…closest to a chalice I have. Nose is light floral, with a strong funky bready yeast. Thin effervescent head that maintains throughout. Color is a dark amber, with a few floaters. Taste is a solid crackery malt, with a constant hit of funkiness. Mouthfeel is crisp, with an earthy heaviness, and a ton of carbonation. As it warms, there is a stone fruit vibe that really overtakes the tongue. Alcohol doesn’t bite, but brings on some warming fairly quickly. I’d say it’s a great representation of the style, but hell, isn’t this that misleading? This is OG for the style, from which others should compare. I should let the next half of the title warm, as that seems to really bring out more complexity. The flavor lingering is really satisfying.



The wife asked if it was worth $50 a bottle? Is any beer “worth” $50 a bottle. Yes. Plus it’s a story of history, with a present day support of a simpler lifestyle and dedication to higher purpose."

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and oily beer. Finishes mostly dry with a decent heat

But that's OK; I'm an old man and a high ABV (13.6 on the 2020 vintage) no longer impresses me. But, this is a wonderfully smooth RIS and it was enjoyed after-dinner along with two friends. Another year cellared will take care of two rough edges: lingering hops; and a fuller melding of the dark fruit and chocolate, like the dessert that Parabola should supplant.



I am an enthusiast for FW and particularly how its owner (Duvel) is smart enough to let FW do its thing. But that is another story littered throughout enough of my reviews of the 7 other brewers Duvel owns; all I like to varying degrees."

This is absolutely phenomenal, and represents the best of what Hill Farmstead is capable of.

There's also an outstanding sweet floral honey-like flavor.

Pours a rich burgundy color with a finger of pink foam. Aroma is cherry forward, but not in a fleshy, fruit forward way, instead delivering a rindy dark pit. It's morphs into notes of almond and cinnamon, with light tart cherry and stone just beyond. Complexity is notable, without any overtly sugary tendencies. Flavor profile delivers those same almond and cinnamon notes. Cherry is present, with a tart twist. Stone, followed by big lemon zest and grassy notes play the outro. Again, the complexity and depth is just amazing. For a beer blended with cherries, it develops much more nuance and thought beyond this single note. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a consistent grit throughout. It verges on bubbly, at least at the onset.

Review 1100!! I figured I’d bust out a special bottle for the occasion, and what’s better than the highest rated Gueuze on BA? Well, Gueuze-inspired I should say, based on recent thread. Whatever the fuck we wanna call it, I’m beyond excited to try this so let’s get into it



After a long and annoying struggle with the double cork breaking inside the bottle, it pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing



Wow, this is super bright in the nose, just an absolute. punch of funk. I'm picking up on aromas of lemon juice, sharp oak, old leather, wet hay, vinegar, apple skin, dried apricot, tart white wine (surprising given the red wine barrel aging), and general floral notes. Really all over the place but fantastic



While it's not as incredible in taste, it is still very damn good, just less sharp than you'd expect based on the aroma. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting wet hay, lemon zest, jammy apricot, white wine vinegar, pear, white pepper, dry oak, and light leather. The swallow brings notes of bright white wine, stone, lemon yogurt, orange juice, apple skin, straw, and light honey



A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp and zesty beer. Finishes very dry with a balanced tartness



Super annoying cork aside, this is a fantastic treat of a beer! There's something special about this one doing a very convincing Belgian impersonation, in the most flattering way. I need to get more to cellar, cheers BA!"

750ml corked and caged bittle - poured into a Riesling/Zinfandel stem at 45°F.



Pours a slightly foggy translucent honey-golden, really verging on orange, like a West Coast IPA. A finger of coarse, sticky, sudsy off-white head forms, with fair retention, and settling to a decent collar, with weak, spotty lacing. Clings to the glass like whiskey. Really a beautiful beer.



Nose: This one travels. No shortage of funk here. Tons of damp hay and wine-soaked oak, with plenty of bright lemon juice and rind. There's ample leather book binding, dusty stone cellar, petrichor, magnolia blossom, and a really dense note of patchouli, with some sweet apricot and marmalade threadinf through. Some funky stable, sea shell minerality, and sweaty brett emerge, but the funk is balanced by plenty of bright fruitiness. Huge nod to Cantillon here.



Palate: Duck Duck Gooze emerges with an impressively balanced acidity. Like biting into a ripe stone fruit, there's a bright *POP* of tartness, but it immediately steps back, becoming more of a lemony tang. Lemon oil, orange juice, apricot, and crabapple lend bright fruity notes, with undertones of cabernet grape, cranberry, unripe plum, and coriander seed. The tartness begins to rapidly subside, showing quite a bit of grain - dusty, with hulls. An almost Gueuze level of funk presents itself in the form of wet hay, damp wood, old musty stable air, milkweed, and a touch of herbal flowery notes with just a whisper of sweaty funk. The tartness completely disappears, and the finish shows wheaty grain, grass, lemon essence, white oak, and just a touch of grapefruit oil that clings to the palate.



Mouthfeel/Body: Absolutely stunning. It's crisp, airy, and quenchingly dry with a shimmering minerality, but there's definitely some soft body which lends presence. The effervescence is truly perfect. Champagne. Zippy, airy, fluffy, and fizzy, but soft and supple. An oily feel lingers.



Overall: This is perhaps the most stunning American wild ale I've had in a long time, perhaps ever. I'm not sure if this is Method Traditionelle or not, but either way, this really is a masterpiece. A sweet grain presence, incredibly balanced acidity, ample funk contrasting against beautiful bright fruity notes, and it all comes together so seamlessly and flawlessly, this has truly transcended the style itself. Simply stunning."

The aroma literally jumps out of the glass on this beer; it has an essential oil like brightness to it, incredibly vibrant. A mix of fresh in season fruits; nothing tropical to me just local summer fruits, but with an extra citrus like bite to it; a little bit of vegetal dank on the finish, it cuts short of onion garlic territory for me.



Taste is much of the same but the beer becomes less fruity more citrus, pithy, with a pretty nice minor sweet malt presence; slight resin/sap aftertastes.



This is a double IPA that is for sure; it has a pretty hefty body, higher end of medium. A very clean drinking beer, dry and biting bitterness on the finish, prickly sappy tingling on the tongue. Also letting you know this is a double IPA is the slight alcohol presence on the finish, no overbearing by any means but present.

The lack of head could certainly be chalked up to the fact that it had probably been a minute or two between the pour and its arrival at my table. Regardless, while there was nothing wrong with the appearance, nothing particularly stood out either. 



The nose was a different story. I'm desensitized to IPA aromas at this point, but this beer smelled amazing Loads of citrus, mango and other tropical notes. Simply an excellent smelling beer. 



The taste was very nice, but not as tropical as the nose. Grapefruit was the only taste I could pick out, but whatever else was there it was above average, but didn't blow me away (keeping in mind I'm not a big lover of IPAs). The feel, however was amazing.

Pours a just barely hazed honey-gold with two-plus fingers of pouffy, shaving cream-like foam. Retention is excellent, leaving a fat bubbly-sudsy cap and a tattered curtain of lacing.



Nose is sweet, malty, and layered with aromas of orange peel and pine needles.



Taste is as expected, leaning into the sweet and malty end of balanced. The earthy-woody pine needle, resinous character is prominent, along with caramel sweetness, oily orange peel and a squeeze of lemon.



Feel is clean, just a little too brisk to pass as smooth (entirely in a good way) and no more than medium bodied with bright, zesty carbonation. There’s a cheerful hop oily tingle on the tongue and a slight boozy warmth in the gullet.

The excellence in Jjjuliusss is felt starting with a similarly creamy peach and golden blend of colors and airy textures as the original Julius. The beer's dense and foggy appearance only works to make it more appetizing. A slow separation of ale from froth suggests a viscous character that carries over to an even more creamy, tangy, sweet and fruity taste just after a grassy, citrusy, herbal and piney perfume than any before.



Less grassy and herbal in taste, the flavors that explode on the middle palate are dominant with all-things-orange. Tangerine, in all its tangy, fructose-sweet, branch-ripe and fresh squeezed vibrance springs to life with a zesty support of red grapefruit, lemon and lime. Tantalizing tropical fruits join the taste with pineapple and kiwi nuances. Smooth in the beer's fleeting taste, a sense of bitter sherbet with citrus zest apply their final and lasting contributions to balance.



Creamy and malty-dry, the taste starts fuller and plush, but trailing bitter, herbal and dry, the soft sappiness of freshly shaven spruce links up with fragrant citrus peel for an evaporative texture and a nearly teeth-churning creamy tartness that aligns itself with sorbet desserts- Its surprising that a single sixteen ounce can can hold so much flavor."

Aroma highlights mango gummies accented with a slight mustiness hinting toward a boggier overlay of guava peel and tropical compost over time; a dense, bready malt backing remains prevalent as light papaya and melon brings a soft freshness to the back end.



Taste offers mossy mango contrasting tangy orange juice upfront, with lingering guava engaging distant melon over the mid-palate while sweet, boggy-dank sensations flow alongside a lime-pineapple juiciness on the back end.



Mouthfeel shows a medium-full body and a moderate, rounded carbonation soon easing to resoundingly creamy, smooth textures; a juicy twang levels density past the mid-palate to an effortless, pillowy grit lingering on the finish.

Notes via stream of consciousness: The can that I have in front of me is labeled JJJuliusss without an exclamation point and the label is white, not orange, but I'm pretty sure this is the same beer. The question is, what is it? I get all of these Julius beers confused. Ahh, this is Julius with extra hops added, first brewed for their 3rd anniversary. It's poured a very cloudy orange body beneath a finger's width of creamy off-white foam. As is the case with all Treehouse beers the head holds up really well and it leaves some very nice lacing about the glass. That hasn't happened yet but I can tell that it will based on experience. The aroma is fruity but also malty. It's sweetish and grainy with notes of orange, peach, and mango. I wish I had a Julius to compare it to but I drank them all! Ha ha! The flavor delivers that sweetish malt and I can taste the oasts in it. It's threaded through with notes of orange, peach, mango, melon, passionfruit, and lime. There's some resin to it, and a touch of pine. It's got a median bitterness but also a lot of acidic ""hop bite"" that balances it and eventually leads to a dry finish where resin and pine linger. In the mouth it's medium bodied but fluffy and smooth due to all of the extra proteins. As expected the head held up well and I now have craggy rings of lacing throughout the entire glass. I honestly can't say how much more aromatic or flavorful this is than the standard Julius but I think I enjoyed it more. I'll have to try to get a hold of more of both to do a side-by-side.

Big orange in the nose. Hints of passionfruit, plum and gummy bears.



Same lovely mix of tropical fruits and orange citrus in the taste. A little herbal greeness and light pith in the finish creates some great balance that prevents the beer from being sweet.

Overall: Typical Tree House IPA which could easily be mistaken for a higher ABV DIPA (which is great). Rather edgy than smooth, but still nicely balanced. Overall a very good brew and a prime example of the style."

Poured into Durobar Charente glass.



Appearance: black bodied beer with dense and thick off white to light brown head that is uneven with lots of large soapy looking bubbles. Light lacing. good staying power. Thick ring remains around the outside of the glass as the head eventually dies down. 



Smell: Big maple and oatmeal with a hint of cinnamon, smokey bacon and a hint of coffee. Hints of chocolate, oak, and bourbon.



Taste: Immediately big maple syrup flavored oatmeal just like what was found in the nose. Bacon and meaty smoke integrated nicely with a gentle ashy barrel char in the middle that is quite enjoyable. Hint of Dad's brand root beer candies and cola. Finish has lots of rich bourbon notes and chocolate notes. This is complex, superbly balanced, and flat out really really tasty. Easily exceeds my expectations for sure.



Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low and adequate carbonation levels. Slightly silky and creamy bodied porter. Very smooth and not any booze at all. 



Overall: Finally! Pretty excited to get to tick this barrel aged porter thanks to TATURBO. This beer is rich without being overly sweet. The barrel notes are spot on and it really is hard to find anything wrong in this beer. Just the right amount of maple which is a flavor that is easy to overdo. The balance is also quite impressive as well. Put this beer on your must try list if you haven't. Breakfast flavors galore with a splash of bourbon and oak. What's not to like? The barrel aging definitely improves maple bacon coffee porter which is a hard feat to achieve. Nice work here from Funky Buddha for sure."

In terms of appearance it pours a shiny black color. A lovely velvety head forms on the beer with solid head retention. It is pretty viscous. Back to the aroma - it is dominated by the maple syrup with underlying notes of smoky bacon, oak, bourbon, and chocolate. All of those aromas are quite strong - so I am not really getting much in the way of coffee.



Taste follows the nose and is very much dominated by the maple syrup flavor, but the surprising part is that it is not at all as sweet as I remember from having this in the past. There is much more roasted malt, chocolate, smoked malts with some slight meaty notes, and the bourbon barrel comes through more strongly. Some slight roasty bitterness comes through on the back end. Feel is thick, full bodied and luscious. Moderate carbonation. Sort of drier on the finish."

Appearance: Poured 1/4th of a glass every time so not too much head. Pitch black of course. Some lacing. 



Aroma: Impressive -- maple, coffee, and smoke all shine through. 



Flavor: Overall sweet almost like a milk stout. Maple syrup throughout, strong coffee throughout as well. Milk chocolate. The barrels come through if you pay attention. There's a slight smokiness on the back end, which is such a great addition. There is absolutely no heat. The advertised flavors do not lie... however I don't get much more than that. Not a bad thing but perhaps was hoping for more. 



Palate/Finish: Medium but oily and sticky. Very smooth, no carb. I do wish this was thicker, but I also realize that this is a porter so I won't knock it too much. Finishes with more coffee and sticky maple. 



Overall: This is a very good beer and it deserves some accolade. I was hoping for something to 'chew' on, but at the same time, the style *is* porter, and I do admire that. The alcohol is completely hidden, and the maple/coffee flavors shine so well in the flavor and in the aroma. This is what impressed me most. On the other hand, it's not the most complex imperial porter I've had, and it's a little lactos-y. Overall, I'm gonna say this is an A beer, but not an A+."

They have the ability to do something that no one else can do and they use it for good. Lawson's finest has a gift for hops and they do good bringing a double dose of their best efforts to the New England craft beer community.



Double Sunshine pours with a strikingly hazy and golden orange appearance. Looking the part of most hazy ale, the beer floats a creamy dense meringue of tarnish froth before enticing the nose with a brisk and brazen citrus scent with an herbal perfume of citronella in a ripe, roaring and racy tone. Deliciously smooth and velvety in its malty upstart, the early palate is met with cereal, honey, caramel and cream.



As the malts settle on the palate, the hops simply begin to blossom with a bounty of branch-ripe Valencia orange, tangerine, mandarin and blood orange while inviting more fruits of nectarine and mango to add even more racy flavors. Red grapefruit tighten its hop taste as a late plunge into juicy notions of sherbet and push-ups. Trending firmly bitter with smooth pine, fragrant woods, citrus peel and herbal and a slightly dank vegetal bite.



Medium-full in body, the beer's bold flavors and creamy upstart finishes remarkably dry and resinous. A long but smooth bitterness is lasting with fruit peels and herb for a session that's classically hazy up front and traditionally bitter to finish- a best of both worlds."

Look: Pours a golden-brownish orange with a pillowy white head that dissipates rather quickly leaving a good amount of lacing. Floaters all over the place.



Smell: Piney, resiny, somehow woody and slightly smoky. Also sweeter notes of melon and gummy bears.



Taste: Less intense, more balanced, but all the notes which can be smelled can also be tasted. Resiny body with notes of sweet melon and burnt caramel, and something woody and smoky popping up here and there. Medium sweetness followed by an intensely bitter finish.

Overall: Very complex west coast style IIPA that combines a typical piney and woody body with different kinds of sweetness.

Well damn, my first Hill Farmstead beer and it’s the 35th highest rated beer on BA! I know they’re more known for their Saisons, but I’m very happy to try this



Pours a hazy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing



For the style, this isn’t super juicy in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of the overripe melon, lemon zest, bready malt, light caramel, peppery hops, fresh grass, and grapefruit rind



It’s a little more aggressive in taste but still feels more rustic than juicy and fruity. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, crackery malt, tangerine, overripe melon, weedy hops, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of grapefruit zest, orange juice, bready malt, peppery hops, fresh grass, and light tangerine



A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a zesty yet creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry and very balanced

Poured a solid medium-dark orange color with a bit more than a half-inch of white head that had good retention and lacing.



A big blast of hops popped out of the can upon opening. Some citrus-orange scents, and some light frootiness. Very low grain presence. 



Fairly similar on the tongue, with a bit of alcohol presence as well.



The body was fairly typical for the style, smooth and light.



Drinkability was good, especially sine the alcohol seemed to fade out a bit as it spent some time in the glass.



Overall, even though almost certainly faded, this still a really nice beer. Would like to try it fresh some time. Worth grabbing if you see it."

Bought at brewery, canned 12 days prior.

Brief, white head. Cloudy, medium orange, with a bit of amber on the side of the glass. Candied tangelo peel, mango, a touch of allspice and light caramelized malt, makes up the aroma. First ⅔ of taste is very good, with a candied tangerine peel, some mango and off-dry ( a wine term for nearly a complete lack of sweetness ), medium toasted, caramelized malts. As soon as these flavors fade, a sharp tangerine peel bite comes in and crowds out all else, for a long finish."

Smell - The nose was a bouquet of fresh lemons surrounded by dankness. 



Taste - Initially, fresh but dry lemons led the profile. There was just a touch of sweetness like the East Coast style, but it was not liquid candy. The dankness really came through in the finish. 



Mouthfeel - The body was nicely thick with an almost gritty body. Carbonation somehow survived the viscosity. 



Overall - This is a great IPA, but I have had better."

It says to drink by 6/8/21, so is this almost old?! Either way, it’s still fantastic. It looks, smells, and feels world class. It’s one of the best balanced IPAs I’ve had in a really long time. I would have guessed this is a 6.5% abv and not 8.2%. I love the bitterness throughout. Not West Coast style, but East Coast hazy like.

Couldn't believe they had it, i haven't seen it anywhere else, so even though there was a steep price to pay i just had to try it. Poured out a deep dark brown with a light tan head that lingered long after i poured it. In fact, several minutes after i poured it there remained a frothy loft of bubbles just waiting for me to taste it. Smell is not too strong. Not strong at all in fact. Very weak. Not what I look for in a beer. I usually want at least some kind of scent, but i've poured this into a snifter and swirled it around a good deal and still receive barely anything. Am i losing my sense of taste or have i just become accustomed to stronger beers? Well whatever nevermind i'll try a sip. A little bit of nuttiness, a little bit of caramel and toffee, a little bit of molasses, a little bit of coffee, a little bit of chocolate, but it's all just a little bit. i'm not certain what's supposed to be the dominant note here. i don't really get what they're truly going for. Usually there should be at least one taste that's predominant, but i'm getting a flat wash of not really much of anything except muted tones of what it claims to have. Aged on maple syrup it says, bourbon it says, well hell i'm not getting much of either. There is a sweetness to it, but it's kind of a flavorless sweetness. Did i get a bad bottle? How could this be rated a 100? I look for deep, dark, strong, bold flavors and this has none of that. Mouthfeel is light and sparkly, probably the best part about this beer. Overall, i'm rather disappointed. I can't believe i spent so much on this flavorless effort. I've had a LOT of brews that have been barrel aged, flavored with coffee and chocolate and maple syrup, but this just doesn't deliver. What's the hype? I'll stick to Hoppin Frog who knows how to get it right. I thought this would be a smooth slow sipper but i'm tempted now to just slam it, get the buzz, and call it a night. So disappointed.

L: Very dark brown, almost black. Small head that settled quickly; very little lacing.

S: Low aroma, mainly of bourbon. The barrel is here but it's more oak than maple syrup. A little roasty, too.

T: Very sweet, but balances really well with the malt and the bourbon heat. I remember this being too much maple when it was new but after two years it's almost perfectly balanced.

L - Served in a clear plastic Solo cup due to the bar’s location inside a giant food court with outdoor patios. Light golden color with a touch of chill haze. Pure white head started out fluffy and a finger thick, but quickly faded to little more than a ring around the glass. Head may have been impeded by the plastic cup.



S - Again the cup may have lessened the impact of the nose, as it was hard for me to get much. Nice DIPA aromas of citrus and pine with some sweet, bready malt at a lower level. Not overly distinctive nose, but hits the right notes for the style. 



T - Explosion of West Coast hops, with orange and grapefruit citrus notes, along with pine resin. Maybe a hint of pineapple. A light touch of bready malt that quickly fades in the surprisingly dry finish. The beer lacks enough malt to begin to balance against the hops, as I normally expect in the style. 



F - Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Monstrous hops bitterness level that burns the citrus into your tongue. Alcohol heat is hard to pick out behind the hops burn. Very dry finish that leaves the hops aftertaste to linger.



O - I was very glad to finally try this beer after years of hype but not having any opportunities in Florida or in my travels. Is it a great beer? Certainly. Is it a world’s best, or an aging example? I won’t get into that debate. I can only say that, for my palate and preferences, this lacks in malt character to stand out as an Imperial IPA. To me it is more properly called an assertive West Coast IPA, and a great one, and I’ll leave it at that."

Pop this beer open fresh (I have only had it bottled...not on tap or canned) outta a cold fridge and get your nose on it for some wonderfully floral and hoppy aromas. At 8% this DIPA is strong and one 17.5oz bottle will set most right requiring a brief 20 min interlude before standing up quickly/getting behind the wheel to hop to the next tasting room/bar.

I have been wanting to get my hands on this beer for a few years. If you know me, I love imperial stout, barleywine and double ipa. If it's not full bodied then probably not gonna rate very high on my list. This brew poured a very light tan with a thin head. Nose was very happy and floral. Mouthful was very light with little malt backbone. I was dissatisfied with the taste of a beer that is rated 100. Maybe 15 years ago but with the evolution of craft beer I find it hard to fathom this beer in the top 50 all time. I would rate it 3 out of 5. Just like Hopslam this beer is overhyped and in my opinion not worth all the accolades. Of I were to taste it on draft the outcome could be different, but like I said I prefer full bodied brews and lean towards other styles. So take it for what it's worth.

Aroma: Hop forward aroma as expected, but not deep or complex with a light malty sweetness in the background. 



Mouthfeel: The body is a thin to medium body, solid carbonation that sings on the tongue, small alcohol warmth.



Flavor: Complex hop characteristics, gives small citrus flavor off from hops with some black currant like flavors and a solid touch of pine and a touch of floral/perfumy like flavors, from the bittering to flavoring hop additions. Small sweetness from the malt flavor to act as the backbone. Long lasting hop bitterness sticks with you after each drink that is still pleasant to enjoy.



This is a solid and most importantly classic/quintessential West Coast style IPA and shows exactly the path from the old school IPA 2000s vibes with the heavy magnum bittering. This beer shows the depth of hops from each stage of the beer making process to give deep complexity to the hop flavor."

Woodbury bar on tap Nonic pint



A- Golden-orange body capped with a 1/2 finger off-white head. Awesome thick lace left on the glass. Retains at a thin foam.



S- Grapefruit and Topical scents with a sugary doughy backbone. Robust and fresh. Leafy hops, tobacco, resin and herbs as it opens up.



T- Great balance of grapefruit hops up font. Doughy and sweet cracker malts in the middle like honey whole wheat. Grapefruit and herbal spicy black pepper hop finish. A little aspirin.



M- medium full body. Crisp. Hoppy bite.



O- Fresh drinkable IPA. No frills or quirky additions. Just a straight up solid IPA. I could see this as a go-to IPA if it was available. Definitely glad I finally got to try this classic brew on the last day of a SF trip.

"1666819763-1949","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/","Pliny The Elder","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/","Poured from a 17.25 FL Oz bottle, bottled on 6-14-2022 so a month and 16 days old. Poured into spiegelau IPA glass.



On the pour a white nearly three finger head forms after a minute or two it slightly recedes making more room to pour, and I am able to get the head over the rim over the glass. Head becomes quite rocky but has very good retention. Carbonation after the pour looks quite ligjt and lazy. Body is a slightly dark gold. On the paler side of a lot of IPAs and with a very slight chill haze. Laces very nicely.



Aroma is quite bright with a hit of resinous grapefruit sweet hops. Some malt sweetness comes through, but the hops are very big on this one. A very sweet floral and citric smelling beer. Nothing off and very clean. More juicy than I expected.



Taste is similar to the aroma but a lot of the fruity qualities are traded for a big wave of bitterness that slowly fades leaving a resinous zesty but sweet and malty finish that lingers but is very nicely balanced after the big wave of hops. Despite the abv I can't really detect alcohol as the hops actually cover it up. Despite being super hoppy this isn't a mess and is very drinkable with a nice hop evolution that gives a good balance of bite to flavor.



Feel is soft and dangerously drinkable with a perfectly balanced carbonation bite to softness provided by the head. Honestly this is tasty af and I'm not an ipa guy nobody does everything right and maintains the balance. This feels like a benchmark and I could drink this all summer long if it wasn't 8% and so damn expensive.



Overall this beer is very hyped up. Don't get me wrong it's very good. There's essentially nothing wrong with it, the bitterness isn't cloying, but is pleasantly present, and it's big and hoppy without forgetting its a malt drink. It even looks beautiful. It's the perfect IPA, but everyone is trying to imitate it so unless this is you're whale you probably have a general idea of how this tastes, you've just had a similar but inferior beer. Is it worth the price? Maybe maybe not though. $7.99 for the bottle at a store in Colorado. Maybe I got scammed."
"1666819763-1950","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/","Pliny The Elder","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/","Comes in a crystal clear golden color, with a creamy, marshmallowy bright white head. Incredible retention with sheets of lacing.

The aroma doesn't explode from the glass, but it's nice. Earthy and piney, with pithy grapefruit. Think forest floor, littered with grapefruit peels. Potting soil, pine needles, pine cone, grapefruit peel, a touch of grass, and orange peel.

Juicy yellow grapefruit, and bright fresh white pine hit in equal measure. Grapefruit and orange peels and juice take over and dominate, but earthy pine needles remain in the background. The malt is subtle, biscuity, slightly toasty, offering a slight sweetness but remaining subtle. It finishes clean and crisp, moderately bitter. Hop oils, grapefruit and pine linger on your tongue and make the palate sticky.

Nice medium-plus body, good carbonation, moves quickly and smoothly on the palate but leaves a lasting impression.



This is every bit a world-class WCDIPA. Tastes phenomenal."

This beer is extremely well crafted and balanced, while punching a piney flavor burst to your jaw. Everything about this screams well balanced while adhering to the West Coat style. And whaddya know, this beer invented the damn West Coat Imperial Ipa Style!



I will say, their only competition would be Alvarado atm, along with Cellarmaker.



There's a couple up and comers. Another OG would be Boneyard brewing who took a malt heavy approach for their beers and somehow, they kept their integrity after the buyout and do have the price advantage over Russian River. Bay Area beer heads are blessed with those two and Cellarmaker, BareBottle, Revision, and Field Works, to go along with the San Diego breweries that make their way up there."

The beer poured the expected blackish brown color, with minimal lacing and not much in the way of head retention. Still, I didn't think this was particularly unusual for a ba impy stout. On the nose, I'm picking up dark chocolate, light licorice, some vanilla and a hint of cherry. Not really getting much of any bourbon. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this moderately sweet stout, but with a slight roasty component as well. Mouthfeel is fairly full, and the finish is pretty long. As others have noted, there's some sort of odd flavor in the finish. It's not bad, just unusual (a slight wet cardboard flavor). Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, which I appreciate. 



This is a nice beer no doubt, but the accolades this beer garners is a bit of a head scratcher. Likewise, the price tag for this beer is a puzzler as well. I ordered 3 ba impy stouts at Ansari's, and the Assassin was clearly low man on the totem pole (a ba coconut stout from 608 brewing from Wisconsin was vastly superior to the Assassin). Whatever. Each to their own. This is still a pretty good impy stout, but given the ""value quotient"" for this beer, I'm pretty sure this isn't something I'll ever need to order again."

Look: Pours an opaque bright yellowish orange color with a frothy off-white head that has small- to medium-sized bubbles.



Smell: I can see why they call this ""Very Green."" It has a lot of green grassy and piney aromas. There's also a lot of tropical and citrus fruit aromas - pineapple, orange, grapefruit. Creamy notes also. Smells like many other Tree House beers that I have had before.



Taste: It's a bit more interesting than the nose suggests. Up front, it's fruity and juicy. But that personality trait quickly fades as the finish is long and bitter, yet not very aggressive at first. It really is a ""green"" finish with big vegetal, grassy flavors including pine, mint, lots of citrus pith. The second sip was much less juicy and sweet up front; already the second sip is bitter up front as the bitterness builds on the palate. As much as you get the flavor of the fruit of the pineapple, you get the flavor of the green pineapple stalks.



Feel: The mouthfeel is soft and creamy.



Overall: I've said it before and I am sadly saying it again. I am largely unimpressed by Tree House New England IPAs. This beer is just not very flavorful or enjoyable for me. There are so many other beers that I would rather be drinking. I can still honestly say that it is a well-made beer, but it's just not made according to my tastes/preferences and therefore I rated it accordingly. I guess that so many people like this beer because it gives a ""hop fix"" along with a super creamy mouthfeel. It's just lacking some elements to make it an enjoyable beer for me."

Poured from a can (14Jul2021) into a Tree House Teku



L: pours a completely opaque, creamy and slightly glowing yellow orange. Massive dense and fluffy white head that fades slowly, leaving excellent chunky lacing as it does. Visually it’s DIPA perfection



S: huge, rich tropical nose right as I crack the can. Pouring into the glass I get huge waves of overripe pineapple, orange, grapefruit, lime. Mix of flesh and pith, dripping fruit with a slight earthy dankness to it. Nice citrusy bitterness as well. Really great layers to the aroma, from bright fruit to richer, more dank overripe/earthy notes



T: delivers the nose very well, immense depth to the very fruit-forward swallow. Mix of pineapple and pithy grapefruit to open, the acidity builds nicely into the middle. Some mango and peach starts for emerge. Really excellent pairing of bright and fresh sweeter fruit with a more acidic, citrusy character. As it warms find that pineapple comes through more, like it. Medium+/long- finish, that pleasant slightly drying acidity carries through



F: medium carbonation, medium body. Very smooth, not overly “full” or heavy/creamy. Superbly drinkable, mildly drying



O: the second batch of Very Green I’ve had, it’s easily one of the best beers I’ve ever had and probably my favorite DIPA. Looks aren’t everything but this beer is stunning. The nose is just incredible waves of tropical flavor, with the swallow delivering across the board"

S: The aroma contains strong juicy citrus and tropical fruits, floral and dank hops and light caramelized malts.



T: The taste likewise starts out with strong sweet and juicy flavors of citrus and tropical fruits. Then a strong floral and dank hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.



M: Crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a murky golden/brass colored body beneath a finger's width of off-white foam. The head appears to be holding quite well as is always the case with Treehouse beers. The aroma delivers sweetish and bready malt along with notes of passionfruit, nectarine, some mild hop resin, and a light touch of citrus. The taste is fuller and more complex with notes of passionfruit, pineapple, orange, citrus pith, and a hint of lemon/lime. The malt is basic and sweetish. It's bready, and oat-like. A very firm bitterness makes it's way through all of the sweet malt (it's got to be more bitter but you just can't tell) but there's also a whole lot of acidic ""hop burn"" and it finishes dry with some passionfruit, soft grassiness, bitterness, and ""hop bite"" lingering. In the mouth it's medium but feeling a little fuller because of all the extra proteins from the wheat and oats, and the carbonation and hop acidity gives a gentle bristle on the tongue before becoming smoother. The head has held up really well and it's left some beautiful lace all around the glass. I'm quite pleased with Very Green and feel that it's actually better than Green but that's just my opinion. Regardles, it remains a solid, well balanced, and highly drinkable beer.

Poured into my Precious Things Teku (my one and only Teku), this was an opaque yellow-orange color, with a good sized & creamy looking off-white head. Lots of lace.



Nose is of tropical and citrus fruits. Initially just sweet fruit scent, as it warms a more bitter, pithy aroma seeps into the background.



More complex than the nose lets on, although the beginning is straightforward tropical fruits and Mandarin oranges, Midway through there's a more pithy, bitter happiness. The level of bitterness is just right to add a shade of complexity to things without clashing with what came before. Things finish off smoothly, with a slightly dry bitter zap to the palate.



Medium bodied, with a mouth feel that's a bit creamy.



Really, really dug this. Really regretting only having one can. Thank you so much for this, Bill!"

Holy. Fucking. Hell. I’m finally having this beer, and my lucky review #777. This beer is the result of my first beer trade ever, thanks to the incredible fo5s. Much appreciated bro, I’ve had this marked as a want on here for just about 3 years. This is the #1 fruit Lambic, and has been for quite some time. It currently sits at #17 overall, and I can’t think of a better beer for my personal #777 as a very highly regarded apricot Lambic. I actually have a few trades going for different vintages of this, with updated reviews to come. Alright, I know that was a lot of numbers, let’s just get into it now



Pours an opaque pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing



This smells absolutely heavenly. Even with over a year of age on it the fruit hasn't faded like some say that it has. I'm assuming it's more prominent in a fresher batch, but it's wonderful here too. I'm picking up on aromas of jammy dried apricot, white wine vinegar, sharp oak, aged leather, white grape, earthy wheat, doughy malt, light pepper, and lemon rind



This is unreal in taste as well, and not nearly as sharply sour as the aroma would suggest. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting juicy apricot, underripe peach, wheat bread, straw, pear juice, lemon rind, and light oak. The swallow brings notes of jammy dried apricot, sharp oak, white wine vinegar, peach rings, lemon rind, crackery malt, lime juice, and old leather



A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a crisp and tart beer. Finishes mostly dry but leaves a slight film behind on the tongue from the residual sugars



I honestly think this might be the one of the best beers I've ever had. Everything is so nuanced but flavorful at the same time. The 6% abv keeps it beyond drinkable, almost crushable, but that is not what I wanna do with this beer. I'm gonna cherish every last drop of this one. With the others I get, I'll see how it develops over time. Another massive shoutout to fo5s for this one. Cheers BA!"

There was a canned date of 07/06/22 @ 09:45:42 on the bottom of the can. I bought this at the brewery, and drank about 2 months from purchase.



Appearance: Deep gold color with 3-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a few minutes, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.



Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.



Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.



Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 6.8% listed on the can.



This is an excellent New England IPA. It has a nice mix of citrus, hops, and other flavors, which makes it enjoyable. Another outstanding IPA from Tree House, and only second to King Julius. I like the overall balance, and would buy this again."

Aroma is wow huge fruity notes mango, peach , passion fruit, light whiffs of orange citrus bitterness on a sweet malt base.



Taste is surprising some fruity enhanced malt but nothing like the sweet very fruity nose. Nice hop bite citrus, some spicy notes that move to dry zesty finish with lingering hops. I normally like hoppy hazy brews and this one is good, just little weird it so different from the nose. If you love soft fruity hazy IPA's not sure you would enjoy this one.



Mouthfeel is about medium but the zesty carbonation makes it seem lighter. Personally just a touch too much for my tastes.



Overall weird to me the nose and taste seem like two different brews. Glad I got to try this but not sure if I would repurchase it. It just confuses my brain a little , not so much it not being good."

My first foray into the Julius “family” was King Julius a couple hours ago, and after pouring this guy, I see - and smell - a lot of similarities. The regular version appears to be slightly paler than the double version, and the head dissipated more quickly as well.



The nose on this however is hitting me more in the face than “King.” I’m getting wafts of canteloupe, mango and orange, and it’s very citrus-forward. Smells fantastic.



The taste is very similar as well, although this tastes slightly more malty, and the feel is definitely nowhere near as chewy. I get much more melon lingering after the sip has faded, as well.



I sipped on King Julius for more than an hour, but I feel like I would crush the regular version all day. Great beer."

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a very cloudy brass-orange body beneath a finger's width of pillowy off-white foam. The aroma is not as bright as I thought it would be having just sampled a Juli-ish, which is their lower gravity/alcohol version of this. I'm getting some sweetish malt that's grainy but not overly so as I can smell the oats as well. It's fruity with soft orange and peach. The flavor is bright, floral, citrusy, and otherwise fruity. I'm getting orange, mango, melon, peach, passionfruit, and lime. There's some resin to it, and a touch of pine, but not as much as I found in the Juli-ish. I guess the little bit of extra malt here is covering it up. I will say that this is much better balanced and rounded though. It's got a median bitterness that keeps it in check across the palate and then leads to a dry finish. I should also note that I found a lot of ""hop bite"" in the smaller beer, but not as much here; that made it seem drier than this. There's not a lot of fruit lingering, but there is some, and it's a touch mineralish. Yeah, this is really nicely balanced. I could drink at least 4 of these in a row. How strong is it? Ahh, just 6.8%? Make that 6 in a row. In the mouth it's medium bodied but with a lot of extra proteins that makes it seem fluffier and somewhat fuller. It's gently crisp and then smooth. Based on what I'd heard of this beer I was expecting a true juice bomb that tasted like orange juice but that's not the case, this is so creamy and smooth that it comes across like an orange-creamsicle.

8.2% New England style IPA by Treehouse



Poured into a tulip glass today from a pint can dated 7-12. 



The body pours a dark pineapple yellow with a fluffy head. Very good lacing throughout the tasting. 



Magnificent aroma. Pineapple, Orange, passion fruit, lemon notes and a dankness provide a pleasurable experience. This aroma is the feature of the NE style that I like most. Use a tulip glass and enjoy the aroma throughout. 



The taste begins with a slight bitterness that quickly dissipated into a light dankness. Easy finish as the light bitterness reappears. Super easy drinking.

Notes via stream of consciousness: Juice Machine is a double NEIPA at 8.2% ABV, It's poured a murky orange and gold body beneath a two finger thick head of slightly yellowed off-white foam. The aroma suggests orange, mango, papaya, and a hint of grapefruit. The taste is fuller, as usual, and offers up everything found in the nose along with additional notes of peach, some floral character, passionfruit, spiciness, a little bit of melon, zest of lime, some hop resins, and a touch of mint. The malt is sweetish and bready. A median bitterness balances it and it finishes dry with some hop resins and spiciness lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied and smooth with a lot of extra proteins but also with a little bit of zing from the acidic ""hop burn"". As usual for Treehouse the head has held up really well and there's a great amount of fancy lacing throughout the entire glass. I don't know if that's because of all the extra proteins or how carefully they're processing their beers (probably both) but they always have great head retention and lacing. This is my third can of Juice Machine and I've blown through them fairly quickly because although it's full of flavor and ""dank"", it's not as ""dank"" or intense as some of their other beers. They make a few NEIPAs that are even more accessible, and this is pretty complex so I'd put this somewhere in the middle range of what they do.

And what magnificent aromas greet you - rich English toffee, vanilla, a bit of fig, oak, and a smidge of booze, all in perfect balance. I am literally drooling.



The toffee is forward on the taste as expected, but it willingly allows room for the vanilla (hurray!), oak (double hurray!), and especially the fig (cubed hurray!) that provides balance to the sweetness of the other components and coasts into the boozy warming at the back of the palate. Simply stunning flavor profile and nuance to a beer this big (13.8% ABV).



The mouthfeel is creamy and more than a bit oily, as expected. I sat on this a bit, and it was more than worth the wait. Truly a world class English barleywine."
"1666819785-2053","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/","V.S.O.J.","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22072/264097/","Pours a dark burgundy that reveals a remarkably clear transparency when held directly against a light. If not held against a light, or if poured in a dark room, the beer looks black. Moderately heavy oily legs form on the glass after a light swirl, foreshadowing a heavy, hearty beer. Head is two and a half fingers of khaki foam.



Aroma is raisins, fig, toffee, molasses, and dark fruits mashed together with leathery, spicy bourbon. Barrel adds additional char and heat, which is smoothed out well by hearty caramel, toasty, and bready malts. That dark fruit character really starts to swell up and become a much more major player in the aroma as the beer warms.



Flavor profile is fig, raisins, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, and hearty dark fruits. Grassy hops add some resinous hop presence, which introduces some pleasant variation to the profile that is not a sugary note, heavy malt, or bourbon. Bourbon is present throughout, but becomes much more present on the back half of the flavor profile, building up heat and complexity akin to the way a snowball builds rolling down a hill. Despite that build up, it never runs away with heat. Underneath it all is strong caramel, bready, and toasty malts. 



Mouth feel is thick with a still effervescence, offering up some light bubbles at the start before smoothing out at the mid-way point. A very light silt adds some further texture, but really, it's smooth. The texture matches, both, the aging process output, and alcohol, suggesting this beer has been slowly pressed flat by the act of time and heavy alcohol. 



Overall, a remarkable beer that pairs bourbon barrel complexity over a resounding barleywine. Regardless of notes, it's a remarkable beer for sipping, offering complexity and depth at every corner and crevice. 



Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 12oz can. Canned June 29, 2021. 15% ABV. 



For kicks, this was served side-by-side with Piggyback 6yr Rye aged in V.S.O.J. barrels. This is a sample from barrel #1. A few notes: Dark coloration, with moderate oily legs after a swirl. Spicy rye on the cusp of the nose, with heavy barrel leading way to floral and mild bourbon and dark fruits behind. Complexity is dense, mixing in a little cake at the finish. Flavor profile brings a more mild profile, building spicy rye over oak, lemon zest, floral and mild dark fruits and bourbon. Spice simmers on the back of the palate long after a sip, emphasizing the rye base. Really smooth, with a crescendo from start to finish that resembles a wheelchair ramp - a linear rise from start to finish.



Served neat in a Glencairn glass."

Pours like they all do... Very nice, glowing orange haziness with a creamy cap that sticks around till the end. Aroma and flavor are a complex, layered mixture of tropical and non-tropical fruits and different ""green"" characters just like the OG Green (probably my favorite beer, and definitely my favorite NEIPA) but turned up a bit. This does not drink like a gimmick. Nose is still a little rough around the edges. But is a melange of sticky, resinous fruit. The flavor is grapefruit oleo, underripe guava, green mango, pine sap. It is so wonderfully sappy-yet-sweet and hop layered/laden. It reminds me of the first time I had Heady Topper*. Morning dew in the Rockies at the break of day after a late night around the campfire. Hot dogs. America. Fuck. So good.

Truly loverly.

Aromas of dank peppermint beneath layers of juicy pineapple and mango slices dominant, with dense undertones of bubblegum yeast accented by papaya as a subtle, bready malt welcomes an earthy, catty stank to the back end of the bouquet.



Taste highlights orange contrasted by sweeter peach upfront, progressively dank and overripe into musty passionfruit and guava over the mid-palate as a catty dank proceeds into bready malt easing into mossy undertones on the finish.



Mouthfeel offers a medium-full body and a moderate carbonation, rounded and fluffy to a peak of creamy overtones and contrasting juicy, boggy resins; a hop twang emerging in the back end guides to a refined, earthy grit marking the finish.

Drinking this is comparable to drinking cold brew coffee concentrate that I forgot to water down. The intensity of flavors makes this absolutely unique. The relatively short time in the barrels seems to leave the oaky depths and nuance behind in favor of a massive straight up bourbon presence. This works well with the strong toffee and raisin base. This does not represent my favorite approach to double barrel barleywine, I will continue to buy multiples of everything Kane offers at a fraction of the price while this is a one and done purchase. But, these are flavors I enjoy at intensity levels that no one else offers. If you are curious, I say try this once. This is leaps and bounds better than Wendigo."

Bourbon and espresso coffee share the nose space. 

The first taste matches the nose. Chewing on it a little reveals notes of fine cacao, bit of vanilla, faint oak barrel, a dark fruit I can’t quite put a finger on and a welcoming heat.

Appearance: Black with a small, dark, beige head that quickly faded. Age probably took a big hit on the head size.



Smell: Fairly prominent bourbon aromas and moderate coffee aromas. Not bad, but again age is a factor here as well as the appearance.



Taste: Bourbon notes, prominent coffee notes, mild brown sugar notes, and mild tannic oak notes. The coffee comes off a touch bitter but considering the age of the beer it's not bad and provides a nice counter to the bourbon notes.



Mouth-feel: Mediuml-bodied with a fairly low level of carbonation. Not a bad mouthfeel but age is a factor.



Overall: While the beer wasn't bad, I get the feeling I'm only getting a glimpse of how good the beer was fresh. hopefully it's rebrewed and I can get my hands on a fresh one."

12.6% ABV 



The beer is listed as “Stout – American Imperial” on BA. 



The beer was removed from a 40ish degree temp fridge after having been refrigerated for approximately 2 years. Beer poured into 2012 BCBS snifter. 



First Impression: Pours dark, thinner than BCBS. 4.5 



Appearance: Standard Bourbon County. An aggressive pour years only a small amount of khaki head that fades quickly, leaving only a small ring around the glass. 4.25



Smell: Coffee up front. Mostly this cold-brew smelling with a hint of grounds and also the dread ‘pepper’. Weak barrel on the nose. 4.25



Taste: 2014 and earlier BCBCS is what all coffee stouts should be judged on for me. As the kids say, ‘it fucks’. And after this many years, to still say that? Come on. Taste starts with the coffee, shifts to bourbon, pulls in some chocolate fudge brownies, shifts back to bourbon, finishes on coffee, and then a slow finish lasts for longer than most BA stouts, let alone BA coffee stouts. Impressive for 12.5% abv. 4.70



Mouthfeel: Coffee stouts are always thinner than their regular counterparts. They just are. While this is clearly thinner than the regular, not appreciably so. For judging this against other coffee stouts, this is still upper echelon. 4.75



Overall: This is a great beer, and I’m jamming on this. I debated about whether to have this tonight, because I have to get up in 4.5 hours to hit the BCBS release. Well, I’m glad I did, but only because I chose to drink this tonight. It’s really fantastic. It’s incredible how well this has held up. I did have this a few years back (just once), and while it was great, I don’t remember enjoying it quite this much. This is just singing tonight. It’s everything that I want. And the finish just keeps going. I’m in heaven. All this said – could it be better? Of course. I’d love to have even more barrel. I’d love to see how this shined at 15%. But for what it is, and compared to others, this is Heaven. 4.65



BA Review Score: 4.56"

Oh boy, we have quite the whale here. From what I've heard, the coffee BCBS is one of the most sought after variants, and 2017 is unfortunately the last vintage. I never really expected to see it on a shelf anywhere. However, when visiting DC this past weekend, I decided to pop in a liquor store to search for some of the Dogfish Head spirits, since we don't get those up here in Mass. Well, I found their whiskey and was happy, but decided to check out the beer selection. This one was staring at me and I immediately snatched it without looking at the price tag. Worth it? Let's find out



Pours a velvety black with a finger of dark tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing but very strong legs



This is wonderfully balanced between roasty and sweet in the nose, like a decadent coffee drink mixed to perfection. I'm picking up on aromas of chewy caramel, lightly acidic coffee, chocolate covered espresso beans, vanilla creme, ripe fig, smooth oak, and just the slightest hint of sweet blueberry



The fact that this has such a strong coffee presence after 4 years is very impressive. Many of these beers tend to fall off in flavor pretty quick, but it is beautifully preserved here, despite not being full force. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting creamy vanilla, lightly spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, medium acidic coffee, and light grape. The swallow brings notes of decadent milk chocolate, oily espresso beans, burnt toast, a touch of that vegetal green pepper character others have complained about in older bottles, and earthy oaked bourbon on the aftertaste



A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and viscous beer. Finishes mostly dry from the bourbon heat



This beer is awesome! It doesn't quite crack my top 10 though I suspect it might if fresher. Regardless, I'm very happy to have tried this one, and here's to hoping they bring it back next year!"

L: Deep black with a slight twinge of brown



A: The winner in my opinion. Bakers chocolate and coffee all the way.



T: Do not drink this beer cold, severely underwhelming. Once it warms there is a strong chocolate syrupy goodness up front followed by a slight sweetened Cuban coffee. While I assume the coffee has dropped off some, still provides a strong aftertaste which makes it more enjoyable. 



M: It’s bourbon county. Always proper almost syrup like.



O: While a damn good beer, I think the hype train has won with the coffee BCBS. I have not had a lot of them, but I prefer the regular. Maybe I’m in the minority here. Still great though."

Appearance: Pours impenetrable dark brown with no head at all, leaving a slight sediment behind in the bottle. 



Smell: Very rich coffee and bourbon, a bit of chocolate. No green pepper.



Taste: Phenomenally smooth and deep. Starts with bourbon, shifts to dark, acidic coffee grinds, finishes with a delightful burnt bread roast. My only demerit is that I find the bourbon ever so slightly too dominant on some finishes.



Feel: Full-bodied but not too heavy, with light carbonation. Bit of alcohol on the finish, but not too much.



Overall: It's a huge beer, really well put-together. It's a bourbon-lover's coffee stout, with a very prominent bourbon character that somehow still doesn't mask the big coffee base."
"1666819794-2094","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/","Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout","https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1146/57747/","2013 Vintage - Los Inmortales Coffee 



335ml bottle - lightly chilled, poured into a snifter.



Appearance: Pours a coal-black hue - slightly thin, with a deep reddish-mahogany ring around the top edge. Zero head, zero foam, zero collar. Just sits like liquorice-coloured liquid in the glass. Lifeless.



Nose: Surpriseingly, the coffee is still here - and quite strong. The coffee is deep, dark, roasty and pungent, with an almost stale quality to it - like a gas station coffee maker that hasn't been emptied or cleaned in a day. It almost smells sticky and concentrated, very much like Kaluha. Zero green pepper. There's some deep roast beneath the coffee, along with a bit of an ashen/smoky note. Some tangy dark fruit peeks through, as well as some bourbon, and if you really dig deep, some vanilla, oak, and baker's chocolate emerge. Not much warmth. Coffee dominates.



Palate: This 7 year old stout greets the palate fairly sweet, with some rich chocolate fudge, brownie batter, vanilla, bourbon, and oak, before an intense coffee presence explodes and takes the lead. It's a miracle there's still so much coffee in here. The coffee is sweet, black, roasty, with some fresh whole bean notes. Saturated, almost like coffee liqueur, and then finally showing some of that stale back coffee character. A whisper of tangy dark fruit pokes out, before some coffee bean bitterness begins to show, quickly compounded by blackened malt bitterness, drying this out very quickly and fully. Some more subtle bourbon, followed by some less subtle barrel reappear, and the finish approaches, bringing sticky black coffee, roasty beans, bitter malt roast, pure cacao, charred malt, and spicy charred oak. No lingering sweetness.



Mouthfeel/Body: Admittedly, I expected this to be thin, given its age, but surprisingly, it's actually packing some nice heft when chilled. It isn't luscious or chewy, but before it warms, it does have some nice viscosity, though it does thin out as it warms. Effervescence is extremely low - not still, and there is some subtle fuzz in there, but like a cup of soda the morning after you poured it. Quite sticky around the lips, but almost fully dries out in the finish with all that roast.



Overall: This is a difficult one to rate. Is it fair to formally review and rate a 7 year old coffee stout that I've never had? It may actually not be. I'll never know how this was when fresh, but even now, I'd say this is a perfectly respectable barrel-aged coffee stout. Strong coffee presence, no green pepper notes, essentially no oxidation, and maybe just a hint of staleness to the coffee. The bourbon and barrel are subdued, and the effervescence is lacking, but as-is, this is still a great coffee stout. The fact that it has held up so well is definitely a testimony to the early-mid BCBS era. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. This is the most you could ask for in a 7 year old coffee stout. I have to wonder if the 2013 was particularly coffee-forward, because apparently less ancient bottles have already lost their beans. Certainly not the case here, but I wouldn't hold onto one any longer than this. Gracefully aged."

Similarly, a visibility on fingers thru a firewater viscosity, at a state where the collar is annulled, if tolerant on time. The pour is deep on mahogany, and transcendent on ruby highlights, while the neck transcribes a copper to chestnut tone. Correspondingly, a thinning out on retention to the hour, which terminates lace delicately, before that annulled header addressed above



S: The cask recitals circumference the subtle (earthy) hop effects, which quarter the esters, while building a strong dexterity around sweet – bready – malt. An inclination on dark fruit that ranges to elderberries, when exhibiting dated prunes amongst raisins. Sequentially, an armored disposition on Crème caramel that’s been slightly browned to aptness, before taxing in a Mackintosh bar. The inclining humidity brawns a treacliness over a Black Forest Chocotorta & liquored truffles, while pitting leathery advances against brown sugar tobacco. Synchronously, a hop bite to softly cuddle malts candied advances on creamed variations, when sylvan elements develop upon the tarry dried fruit inclinations. With this in mind, a bittering – woodsy – expansion that’s deepening on pine resin around timberlands, yet a facilitating aid to not overextend the greenery virulence. Moreover, a step that nears Goobers with a charred following on walnuts, besides stale cherry bitters to coriaceous stipulations. Oxidation is lightly pressed against the late solvent esters that work to benefit the movement, by suggesting a Pedro Ximénez cleverness, while barreling the oak staves at length



T: Bourbon continually pillars the complexity with a warming – humid – torridness on malt, as hops lightly frame a woodsy path. The elements touch on a caramelized fig custard, while parading crystallized stone fruit in a molasses – marshmallow – soufflé. Secondly, a posturing sweetness to neighbor an unwanted cloyingness in balminess; however, a position that’s impeccably groomed to cloak heat. In sequence, a spice to fruit component that prompts Ethyl Caproate under the residual malt pleasantness. There is an ongoing sentience over the varying cask proportions, which are competently equipped to gamble on the sustained aeriation. Thusly, meandering polymers to further provoke/strengthen vanillin aside honeyed spices, while continuing to calibrate the oak lactones. The barrel presence continues on to address almonds with lightly shredded coconut, as a hard Skor emanates against fudge. In addition, liquored raisins applied to charring, when shriveled cherries pass cordials & cola taffy, once hops attune that backwoods kick to face grape – brandy – bugs. A measure that becomes thirsting of tannin stipulations in the patient exertions, as dried leaves spread from a nearby – progressive – ruin 



M: Sidesteps under-attenuation in the inclusive duty, of not overwhelming the rich records. Nonetheless, the approach is sweet with a chewy dexterity and a warming sensation, while carbonation is handled in a judicious manner. An approach that does not burn or madden the slick feel, as longevity offers a calm smoothness, in the act of intellectualizing a system over the dry (oak) tannin mannerisms 



O: A hop bill that’s cautiously tempered against a glucose powerhouse, which bypasses the aggressiveness on bite, while still prominent to ally the esters. They offer a balance to the finer points on wood amid the several transfers, as malt sweetens the complexity chronologically, in anticipation of the craftily dry hooks. An onset that’s censoring on depth with a tough buildout; albeit, an advantageous/more beneficial buildout, if given the patience to draw out time"

Lovely look as per usual. Glowing gold, hazy, ok covering of creamy white head that leaves swooping lacing. The aroma is dank and earthy compared to what I was expecting, with some stonefruit and clementine sweetness underneath. Perhaps a tiny bit faded, but I might be having an off day. Delicious and enticing regardless. The flavor is (as expected) a barrage of peaches, citrus (sweet not tart or bitter) and weedy hop funk. There is definitely more to it but on the whole it is a balance between peachy sweetness, canteloup, clementine and the more resinous (but not sappy) character of the hops. Mouthfeel is spot on as usual, creamy, round and filling while also refreshing. Really nice beer. I think it was Haze that I once described as a sweaty hippie taking a nap in the shade after a day of harvesting peaches. Well in this case the hippie is also burning one and we are smelling his feet after stomping up some overripe peaches to make wine. Or something like that I have no idea...

This review is for the 2019 vintage. The 2019 is not substantially different (going off memory), although I think the body (mouthfeel) is a little thicker.



Surprisingly, at 3 years this beer hasn't lost much (any?) vanilla, although refrigerated most of that time. 



The best part of this beer is either the taste or the smell. The nose is loaded with what reminds me of buttercream icing - with a hint of something else. Perhaps the alcohol that you get off vanilla extract. The taste is similar, but the buttercream on the taste is more of something you have to use your imagination for. It's the essence, but not direct flavor. Lots of deep, fudgy chocolate. A bit of alcohol on the back end, which is unusual, but I suspect is a result of the interaction with the vanilla. While tasty, I wouldn't say that the taste is complex.



Nothing exceptional about this beer, but it is very good. I think that my score accurately reflects how I feel about this beer and what I think it is deserving of."

The beer pours a black coffee color with a dense creamy beige head of 1 cm. This foam fades to a thick edge layer that creates some scattered lacing on swirls and sips.

Aroma is dark fudge, chocolate, bourbon, some vanilla notes and a little fusol alcohol. No hop presence on this aroma.

First sip is lighter body than I expected and smooth slightly creamy texture. Carbonation is soft and gentle and rolls easily across my palate. Easy drinking for a big boozy beer.

Flavor is sweet fudge and chocolate with hints of toffee and brown sugar. I also get bourbon and some vanilla and black peppery spicy heat on the finish. Again hops dont show up anywhere in this brew.

Im glad to have tried this one and like the flavor and aroma, I do think the beer could have a thicker body but that is just me. WOrth grabbing a bottle."

This is the 2019 edition, so a little age on it. Sorry, it's all I could find! The bottle has 2 check boxes though, one for ""drink fresh"" and one for ""cellar and save"" and the latter is checked. So I'm at least following the rules.



A: Pours super dark and thick, motor-oil like. Nice lacing up the glass. Minimal off-white head that fades quickly.



S: Huge vanilla up front. It's like extract, maybe vanilla coffee creamer. Super on the nose, with a little bourbon note behind it. 



T: Again, vanilla is the centerpiece. It's a real sweet vanilla note here, I know it's not extract, but it's so concentrated and strong. Bourbon there on the finish, really a second player to the vanilla. 



M: This is where this beer really excels. Nice, full mouthfeel. Very balanced. The vanilla is huge, but so is the bourbon. Feels like everything is in HD. Way chewier and thick than some of the more recent BCBS beers I've had.



O: Okay, well. This is very good. I'll start by saying I am not familiar with BL at all. I always noticed FO at the top of the 250 list, but it was so out of reach, I didn't think much of it. Was very fortunate to take a vacation to SF recently and a shop still had some '19 bottles left. Seems like the big comparison point with this beer is BCBVS, which I can totally see. I haven't had that beer in some time, so this isn't a 1:1. But I'll say just from memory that this beer is every bit as good, if not better. My initial impression is that I like the mouthfeel and balance of this beer more. But I do feel the vanilla flavor of BCBVS might be a tough better. This is really strong and vanilla forward, and it's a really sweet and pastry-like vanilla. Not that I want it subdued in any way, but BCBVS has it reeled in and maybe a little more natural-tasting. I really feel like I'm splitting hairs here. At the end of the day, it's huge props to BL for making a really good, chewy, balanced, BA stout. Oh, and I think the age may have even helped this beer. I get no sense of oxidation or fading of flavor. Again, the vanilla is huge on this.



Recommendation: I think this beer deserves its ranking and reputation. Must try for any BA stout fan."

This beer has the look of a beer that has seen some pretty significant barrel aging (though it's not overly viscous). On the nose I get dark chocolate and vanilla, with underlying bourbon and light licorice. It's nice but I was expecting a more robust aroma profile. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this fairly sweet stout, but with a much greater level of intensity. Mouthfeel is fairly full, with a long, moderately sweet finish. Carbonation seemed to be on the low side, which I tend to think works well with rich, BA impy stouts (like this one). Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, though you can tell it's up there a bit. Even so, there's no way I would guess an abv. in the 14% range. 



This is a very nice BA impy stout, no doubt, though I guess I was expecting a bit more complexity. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it, but I'm not sure it's a beer I'd go out of my way to find. Still a very solid beer..."

Looks lethal and the nose goes as deep as you want it to. I could sniff this all day; there’s dark rye bread, beef jerky, baker’s chocolate…

That flavor, though. It tastes like a pastry - fig, vanilla, caramel, flaky shell - that doesn’t actually exist. But then it’s also cake! Steph sez: “It’s like they crashed a full bakery into the bottle.”

4-way mud wrestling match between all the vanilla (both bean + barrel, yet without any booze from the latter), sugar, dark fruit, and roasty notes. Everyone takes a turn without taking over. 

It’s a perfect example of barrel aging, it’s savoury, it’s dessert - walks a razor’s edge. How is it so cakey without being that sweet? How does it tame the sweet without being charred or boozy? Not hot, ashy, cloying, sugary… the execution is just baffling + masterful.

The aroma has notes of vanilla, roasted malts, chocolate, caramelized brown sugar, brownie batter, oak, and some light smoke and dark fruit notes. The vanilla however is the show here - its absolutely dominated by the vanilla and its lovely.



Taste follows the nose with notes of roasted malts, dark fruits, vanilla, sweet cream, bourbon, wet oak, vanilla, chocolate and yea, vanilla. If you like your vanilla stout to avoid subtly this is perfect. Its sweet, but dances up to the cloying line without going over. The barrel aging is nicely balanced. There is a light smokiness that I occasionally get, but I suspect that is the influence of the bourbon. 



Feel is thick, fuller bodied, smooth and viscous. Mild, soft carbonation, but it does not come across as under carbonated.

The mix of bourbon barrels is very complex. You don’t get any one distinct flavor, but rather a changing swirl of sweetnesses and woods. The vanilla comes in mid-palate with a sort of vanilla bean shell earthiness, a hint of coffee-ness without the coffee. The malts are deep, robust, providing a massive foundation.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing.



This smells very strongly of coconut, with loads of milk and dark chocolate, very slight roast, light bourbon, and lots of creamy vanilla.



This is definitely sweet, but honestly, not as sweet as I expected. This really does meet the hype that it garners - it's exactly what you want out of high quality pastry. The coconut is done so well, it's so bright and vibrant and just plain tasty. There's a little bit of barrel, it helps anchor the beer slightly. The vanilla is also done very well, and it's all just layered on top of a very tasty and creamy base beer.



This is very creamy and rich, with no real booziness to it at all. It's very, very drinkable.

Aroma is a pleasant quick hit of tropical fruits, citrus, and mild resin and grass. It melds together sugary hop notes seamlessly with sticky hops for a dramatic, dynamic, quick-hitting aroma. Light bready malts adorn the back of the aroma profile, but are faint in comparison to the hops. Hops are never loud, instead, they land at a mild volume of ""six"" on a scale of 1-10, ten being the highest. Instead of using volume, hops are overlapped to create complexity. 



Flavor profile is light tropical fruits and citrus at the onset, sharing the spotlight with resiny, grassy, piney, and mild herbal and floral hops, before dipping back into tropical fruits at the finish. Pine notes build in intensity as the beer warms, but it refrains from crossing into overly sticky or heavy. It's never overtly sweet, nor does it carry a bitter bite at the end, as do some west coast IPAs. Instead, the end is marked by a light dryness that marks an end to hops. That dryness is accompanied by bready malts. 



Mouth feel is medium-thick with a consistent, crisp texture driven by a mild effervescence. It's just thick enough to drink more like an experience, and less like a parking lot, tailgating IPA - though I would never turn down a pour / bottle of this in the latter situation. 



Overall, this beer embodies wonderful balance, along with thoughtful nuance, to create a dreamy smooth IPA. Hops are pleasant, plump, and forward, without carrying the pedal-to-the-metal force of some other IPAs. This one is marked and adorned by simplicity and nuance. 



Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 500mL bottle."

Ever since finding craft beer through Sam Adams in the early college days of the mid-2000s, this has been the ultimate Sasquatch beer. Spent most of my years on the east coast and college in Arizona but never took the trip to Northern California. Then finally, living in San Diego, they decide to send more kegs for 2022. Incredible find through a random Google search. Turns out the owner of Fathom Bistro & Bar knows Vinnie. I figured it would be similar to the best beers from HF/TH/Trillium but it’s so different. It’s the perfect West Coast hoppy beer but amplified. Super resinous, dry, and dank. Amazing finish. Feel and body are so smooth. Flavor is obviously off the charts. This is worth the hype!!!"

T: Taste is immediately wildly complex. There’s a sweetness up front followed by a sour tart punch, then lingering oaky vanilla on the finish that lasts forever. It’s not as aggressively tart as some lambics/gueuzes, likely subdued by the cask asking. Other characters I get are red grapes, tart citrus, moderate spice. Just fantastic, so much going on, and the finish is divine. 5

Review 1200!!! For this landmark review, I'm tackling the highest rated Traditional Lambic on BA, which also happens to be the 10th highest rated beer overall on the site. This one has been a huge want for me for quite some time now, so I'm happy I managed to source a bottle. I will drink half of this immediately and decant the other half for about 20 minutes, as suggest by 3F and others who have reviewed to see the difference. I will take the highest of the 2 for the official rating, but I'm sure that will be the decanted version. Let's pop it open



Pours a cloudy deep orange with just a thin ring of bubbles which obviously leaves no lacing. Expected for the style, and I don't think decanting will make a difference in this regard



The first whiff of this tells me that decanting is probably the move, as it feels like it needs to open up a bit first. Pre-decant, I'm picking up on aromas of peat smoke, leather, oxidized sherry, wet hay, and white wine vinegar. Post-decant, I'm picking up on aromas of lemon juice, tart peach, white peppercorn, oxidized sherry, wet hay, wheat cracker, toasted oak, light smoke, and stone



The same applies for taste, this is super funky and almost aggressive pre-decant. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon juice, olorosso sherry, sharp oak, leather, sweet honey and light smoke. The swallow brings notes of peat smoke, wet hay, old leather, vinegar, sharp oak, lemon zest, and apple skin. Post-decant, it really opens up. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon juice, pear skin, oxidized sherry, toasted oak, earthy wheat, wet hay, and a touch of peat smoke. The swallow brings notes of oxidized sherry, peat smoke, wet hay, lemon zest, tart peach, wheat bread, stone, light leather and sharp oak



Much like the appearance, I don't think decanting will have any effect on the mouthfeel. A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a sharp and funky beer. Finishes bone dry with a hefty funk. This is so damn refreshing that I could literally chug it, but obviously I wouldn't do that



Wow, this is truly awesome stuff. I mean, I can't say I'm surprised, I knew what I was getting into, but it was an absolute honor. Paired wonderfully with a smoked bleu cheese and fig pecan crackers. I couldn't think of a better beer for 1200. Cheers BA!"

Pours a beautiful gold color with a light haziness to the transparency. Head is two fingers of white foam. Aroma is sherry and barrel right off the cusp. Funky stone, lemon, and earthy notes round it out with a light funky nose. Sherry smooths things out, elevating the whole nose from base, while delivering stronger, more potent notes of dried fruit. Flavor profile builds on the nose, hitting sherry and barrel character first. Stone, lemon, tangy green apple, and earthy notes round it out - again. There is a sublime twist of funky tartness that does well to give the whole flavor profile an additional dimension. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. Texture is driven by a consistent, smooth, even texture. Overall, just a splendid beer, in each terms of complexity, quaffability, and thoughtfulness. Lovely.

Taste follows the nose tropical fruits with a big dose of orange. Hints of passion fruit, pineapple, peach, melon. Nice big malt base with light sweetness.

Pours an opaque, rusted dark orange body capped with two fingers of creamy, off-white foam; decent head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, moderate, frothy collar, amd layers of chunky, webby lacing encircling the walls of the glass.



Aromas of fresh orange juice sit atop a fluffy malt foundation, soon welcoming peach, passionfruit, and grapefruit peel as undertones of catty dank poke through over time and musty lime eases through the closing impressions.



Taste offers candied grapefruit and sugar-dusted orange as a passionfruit zest meets musty lime to balance a level, tropical citrus overlay, while subtler undertones of fresh peach/mango linger on the finish.



Mouthfeel brings a medium-full body and moderate carbonation, dispersing a weighty fluff of glossy resins through the mid-palate; a creamy counterbalance to a largely subdued grit on the back end eases to a soft hop twang and minimal perceptible bitterness through the finish.



Sweet fruit saturation sports detailed edges of earthier dank, and while heavy on the palate, maintains a steady, balanced presentation of ripe, juicy resins throughout."

It is definitely citra (mango and papaya) forward with the Tree House yeast also playing a co-starring role providing some bubblegum-like chewiness.

In a world of princes, they are the king.



And the excellence in King Julius is not only expected but also realized with a creamy peachy-taupe and golden hue with airy textures in its creamy meringue-like froth. The beer's muddled appearance only works to make the session more appetizing. A slow separation of froth ale underneath suggests a viscous character that carries over to a creamy, tangy-sweet and fruit-filled taste just after a grassy, citrusy, herbal and sprucy scent starts out like a fruitier citronella.



The flavors that simply blossom on the middle palate are abundant with a bursting fruit display. Branch-ripe tangerine,in all its tangy, fructose-sweet and vibrant glory springs to life with a zesty support of grapefruit, lemon and lime. Tantalizing tropical fruits join the taste with pineapple, pawpaw and kiwi nuances. Smooth in the beer's fleeting finish, a sense of herbal sherbet with citronella apply their final and lasting impressions of spiked fruit punch.



Creamy and malty-dry, the taste starts plush on the palate but trails into a semi-dry, smoothly bittered, softly resinous and tea-like finish. The soft sappiness of fresh and perfumy cedar links up with fragrant citrus peel for an evaporative minty cooling and a nearly teeth-churning creamy tartness that aligns with gin-spiked sorbet textures as well as flavors."

There are so many good NEIPAs out there that I often think they start to run together... then I taste something like this. Sweet at the very beginning, but also floral, big citrus notes, grapefruit and orange peel, with a silky feel. What's incredible is how clean it finishes for what really starts out pretty sweet, but the grassy and a little bitter orange hop resin at the end leave your mouth not overly sweet at the end.

""The Crimson King's balcony beer"", indeed.



Wow. It really is cranked up about as high as could be in terms of orangey lupuline saturation. Drinks like Orange Crush toilet wine made in a Scandinavian white-collar prison in heaven. That or an Orange Julius from hell. Either way, only the best. 



Big and rich and fruity and creamy and boozy. It is big enough to require easing into while never approaching harshness or anything off-putting in the flavor. Lovely look to it. Aroma and flavor are an at once complicated and simple blend of tangerine, clementine, apricots, grapefruit rind dipped in honey, pithy citrus oil, weed that has been rehydrated using orange peel, I could go on. Again, wow.... 



Like with most of the IIPAs from TH, this is as close to perfect as you can get. A balance of all the individual components of the style each unique, each cranked to 11 but each in total harmony with the others. Textbook example of what the style can be.



One other thing I want to add here for no real reason. I am far from a TH expert but I have a decently experienced palate and have had a few dozen of their beers over the years. These are the first of their beers I've had in a couple years cause of the pandemic and damned if their packaging has not gotten even more incredible (at least compared to the best packaging you find in Quebec). A month old and just mellowed right into itself. No vague hints of oxidation, no fading or changing profile over the few cans I've had of this (and others ranging up to a month and a half old). Anyway, cheers to the canning line. Based on their many date code messages I've seen over the years and including this one I think we'd all enjoy sitting around listening to music together. You guys rock!



Cheers, KC!

Serious question, does Half Time ever disappoint? Any time I’m heading to New York I make a point to stop in there, and I always find good stuff that I can’t really find elsewhere. In addition to 2015 vintage 120 Minute IPA, they had this for fills. A successful trip there yet again. I’ve wanted to try this one for a while, currently sitting at #7 of the highest rated beers of all time on BA. I’m very excited to try this, so let’s crack it open



Pours a very dark brown with just a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing



It’s not even a question that this is loaded with maple in the nose, but it feels very authentic. I’m picking up on aromas of maple candy, medium roast coffee, sweet caramel, nougat, milk chocolate, raisin, and vanilla creme



In taste, it has an interesting vibe where it’s even more sweet, but also quite balanced in its sweetness. More or less sweetness from different notes working together well. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, light roast coffee, marshmallow, sticky maple, and light bourbon. The swallow brings notes of maple candy, sticky caramel, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, toffee, and candied raisin



A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a super slick beer. Finishes very sticky with a bit of boozy heat



This is good no doubt, great even, but it is very sweet. Because of this, I can’t give it reslly anywhere near the average. A good beer, but there’s better options for this kind of thing"

I am blown away that anyone could complain about the $15 pour. Most of NYC just had a mediocre pinot noir for $15 and found that normal. This may be the very best pour value in the city. Go in before it’s gone.

Oily legs clings to the glass long after each swirl of the used motor-oil looking liquid. The look personifies heft and thickness. Aroma is coconut and vanilla bean, with roasty, toasty, and mild nutty malts following closely behind. It has a sweet start that is quickly curtailed by a cut of whiskey and char. These roasty qualities pair well with the additional thick chocolate and and caramel notes. Flavor profile is coconut, chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee, and heavy roasty and toasty malts. Bourbon and char add to the mix, without cutting or overdeveloping heat. Smooth coconut and vanilla bean is present throughout, bringing with them a little twist of sweetness. Mouth feel is thick, nearing velvety in texture. The weight of the beer stamps it out short of being creamy. Overall, coconut notes are great here, pairing up well with whiskey. There is a lot to it, and yet it remains simplified and laser focused on the task of providing a heavy stout with addition of coconut and vanilla bean.

Oh man, here we are. The highest rated beer from Alaska, and 8th highest rated overall on BA. Getting Anchorage beers is always a treat, but I’m expecting this one to go beyond a treat. Let’s pop this bad boy open



Pours a very dark muddy brown with a finger of reddish dark brown head that immediately fades to nothing and leaves no lacing but decent sheeting



To call the nose decadent would be a massive understatement, I could smell this one from the second I cracked it and the aroma filled the room. I’m picking up on aromas of sticky caramel, thick fudge, toasted coconut, sweet bourbon, cinnamon, dates, light roast coffee, nougat, and a touch of maple



While it is certainly good in taste, it doesn't quite reach the levels of the aroma, though there's still a lot going on. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting chocolate cake, black cherry, sweet coconut, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, creamy vanilla, burnt caramel, and a touch of fudge. The swallow brings notes of chocolate cake, toasted coconut, creamy vanilla, sweet bourbon, fresh oak, fruity coffee, dates, and burnt caramel



A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a rich and slick beer. Finishes slightly sticky with a touch of boozy heat but nothing overbearing



This is truly an awesome beer. I'm sure many will complain that batch 1 was better or some stupid shit like that, but having had only this one, it's amazing. What a treat, cheers BA!"

Pours jet black with insanely dark brown head. The head disappeared within seconds, leaving an array of very small coconut chunks floating on top. Looks fantastic. 



The nose is absolutely insane. Thick layers of vanilla, coconut, bourbon, chocolate, toffee, marshmallow, a touch of maple, figs, and more sweet fudge. This is definitely on the sweet side, but it just smells thick and creamy. 



The taste is marvelous. In addition to the vanilla, fudge, coconut, and bourbon, some of the roasted malts from the base stouts comes through. Marshmallow and some dark fruit. The coconut is definitely on the toasted side, at least that is what comes through. Some burnt toffee, a touch of coffee grounds, and some oak bitterness on the back end. Overall, this hits all the senses and makes for a great ride. Not overly sweet on the taste. 



Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Long aftertaste. Overall, a fantastic BA stout."

Very rich, powerful aroma; fudge and milk chocolate; roasted and charred grain; moderate sweetness. Very sweet and spicy taste; cocoa and milk chocolate; vanilla and cinnamon; coconut; raisins and figs; fairly bold alcohol presence simmering beneath the sweetness. Heavy body; slick and chewy; very rich residual sugar feel; some alcohol warmth noted, increasing as the beer warms.



This beer exudes decadence and richness. The overall sweetness is a bit overpowering. I think the alcohol notes are more from the beer's ABV rather than anything from the barrel aging. The lack of any head is also a minus. Still, taste-wise, and overlooking the dominating sweetness, this isn't a bad imperial stout, just lacking some depth and complexity that it really could have it had a bit more balance between the malts, coconut, vanilla, and barrel-aging used in its creation.

And maybe this is 10 years of anticipation talking, but: eh. Well, no, it's not ""eh,"" it's incredibly well made for the style, but I'm a ""juicy"" NEIPA guy, the piney intensity of most DIPAs usually turn me off and it does here as well. The look is a typically nice yellow haze, and the smell is the best thing about the beer -- full of different aromas with pine leading the charge, followed by lemon rind and white pepper.



In my opinion don't listen to the can, pour it in a glass as the complex and powerful aroma is the best thing going here and needs to be experienced.



Now we get to the less favorable parts, which is the mouthfeel and aftertaste. Powerful, mouth coating pine, which is what some people look for but not me. But the worst part is the intense carbonation and gassiness. I'm burping after two sips and bloated by the time the can is done.



To close out on a good note, it has one of the top-5 labels in beer."

L: Normally kept in the can, this one pours a hazy dark orange with a big head that quickly thins to a film with splotches on the cap and a thicker ring around the glass. Lacing is minimal but attractive.



S: Huge aromas of everything good. Floral, citrus, tropical, mixed berries, and pine. Incredible.



T: Strong hop character in your face up front. Mellows a bit in the middle to reveal some delicious juicy fruit and berries, but the hops never take a back seat. Finishes dry, but not as bitter as the hop punch would suggest.



F: The hop onslaught provides a sticky, resinous mouthfeel, which is not a criticism.

Bready malt and citrus juice give the impression of sweetness, alcohol is noticeable. I drank out of the can for a few sips, bitter, semi-dry and boldly flavored. Hops are way out in front, juiciness masks the malt flavor. Bitterness rises throughout the taste.



Next, I poured most of the rest into a mug. Pale orange-straw body, very hazy with a rich creamy white head that quickly shrunk to a cap that lasted leaving rings of lacing. The taste is best this way and represents a well-made Imperial New England style IPA. 



Next, I added in the dregs, and I can see why this is not recommended. The haze changed to cloudy and turbid, the taste changed to peppery bitter with a slight funky juiciness. I don't mind the dregs; the white pepper bitterness hides the alcohol and keeps the sweet juice taste in check.



Medium bodied with plentiful carbonation, bold, bitter and still balanced but I wouldn't call it smooth. Lightly colored for the style and begs the question ""Should there be an Imperial NEIPA category?"" 

Following of the pouring guidelines is highly recommended.

Light orange and cloudy with a silky-looking pure white head that builds up and holds as a lid, ever-so-slowly receding and leaving great lacing behind

Aroma: Ripe peaches, mango, tangerines, strawberries, cantaloupe melon, pine, some kiwi, kumquats, Cannabis, blueberries, and some sweet malt

Taste: Opens up with a barrage of citrus fruits and resinous pine sap that seemingly gain strength as they develop. Peaches, mango, and mixed berries pop up both together and separate as the journey continues and dankness also makes it presence known here and there in no-so-subtle ways. Malt sweetness tries to keep up but is continually beaten back by the hops and closes with a conifer-laden finish and a delectable, strong bite

Mouthfeel: Full, a little slick, medium-high carbonation, and felt and I’d say medium-strength dryness on the finish

Overall: Wow, this is outstanding. To me, this was the OG I heard about, here on BA, before the NE-Style IPA trend migrated West and when I saw a month-old can, I had to try it as I haven’t been a fan of the sub-style much since it took over here but figured and wished I would be. Happy to say, this is my type of beer though as it absolutely captures the amazing aromatics that the late/dry hop additions and yeast can being to the ‘hazy’ style but it drinks like a WCIPA without the chewy feel and an awesome, pithy bite, and plenty of dryness. Color me WAY impressed and I’d buy this again and again in a heartbeat. Thank you, The Alchemist, for creating this gem and props on blowing me away right out of the gate, as that doesn’t happen often"

No canned on date. This must be fresh because this doesn't get distributed here very often and it usually sells out pretty quickly.



Look: Pours a mildly to moderately hazy pale yellow/golden color. The head dissipated quickly. This is very pale for an 8% ABV Double IPA.



Smell: The aroma is very expressive. Tons of dank, resinous hops. A bit of citrus thrown in too. Up front, I get a strong green bell pepper note. This yields to citrusy notes and resinous, piney hoppiness. I get notes of grapefruit and lemon hard candy, along with secondary notes of papaya and mango.



Taste: This is really good. It is actually quite drinkable given how aggressive it is. Up front, it's citrusy and dank. The finish is tooth-enamel stripping bitterness, in a good way. It has a strong bitter finish with lots of woody pine tar, grapefruit pith, and lemon rind. The finish is very dry and the bitterness lingers long.



Feel: It has a slick and oily mouthfeel with a relatively soft carbonation. Medium bodied.



Overall: This is my first time trying Heady Topper, as well as my first time trying anything from Alchemist. There is so much hype around this beer, so it was almost impossible to live up to it. But it actually manages to come pretty close. What I find most interesting about this beer is that it is so different from ""New England-Style IPAs"" that are made by 90% of breweries today. To me, this beer is more West Coast at heart than it is an NEIPA. This beer reminds me of Lagunitas Super Cluster, which I know is all-Citra hopped and I do not know which hops are used in Heady Topper. I would think that there at least has got to be Citra in here too though. Also reminds me a bit of Foley Brothers Prospect."

The beer pours fairly dark, blackish brown color with good head retention and considerable lacing. The beer certainly looks impressive enough. On the nose, I pick up vanilla, green chili peppers, some chocolate, underlying coffee and considerable whiskey. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, though I thought it a bit hot on the finish (something that is especially noticeable, given the chili flavor in this beer). That being said, the barrel aging seems to mute the base beer flavors in this beer somewhat, and really doesn't seem to blend in all that well. It does add another flavor component/dimension, which is always nice, but the whiskey flavor otherwise doesn't seem to bring a lot to the party in this beer. Mouthfeel is fairly full otherwise, and the alcohol seemed to be pretty well integrated into the flavor profile. Drinkability is pretty good, though it's hard to imagine drinking more than a small amount of this beer at a sitting.



This is a very nice beer, but given it's reputation, I confess I was expecting a bit more from it. Very glad I had the opportunity to try it, but this probably isn't a beer I'd want to seek out again."

Pours black with a finger and a half of dark caramel foam. Good head retention. Aroma is spices, cinnamon, chocolate, toffee, caramel, and molasses. Roasty and toasty malts offer up a firm base, adding a strong malty stout backbone to each whiff. As the sweetness crescendos to a peak, barrel character sweeps in to add some char, bourbon, and bitterness. Alcohol remains an after thought, allowing the beer to shine forward of its ABV. Loaded from first whiff to last sniff. Flavor profile is more of the same - a firm stout base of roasty and toasty malts form the foundation of cinnamon, spices, vanilla, caramel, molasses, toffee, and cream. It opens up less spicy than the nose, but finishes more spicy than the nose, that is to say, the dynamics are shaped in contrast - mirrored. Only caveat to the mirror image is the barrel character notes of char and bourbon that come thru at the end again, dropping this stout an octave into deeper heartiness. Despite the bourbon character popping through the beer, the beer never comes off as hot. Mouth feel is thick with a smooth, consistent grit. Its feel is uniform from front to back. Overall, incredible depth with loads of barrel complimenting the initial spices well. It borders on an ADHD stout, spreading it's attention in a spiderweb of directions, but remains cohesive enough to form an intoxicating melody.

L:I was looking for Marshmallow Handjee. Looked for awhile. Looks cool in the bottle and better in my wine glass.

S: Mmmmm - did I see it can't be perfect? The nose on this gem is as close as it gets. Before the characteristic Dark Lord depth, there is the vanilla-creamy-sweet-smores thing going. And that's just the easy part. The complex, fine barrel notes compete with the earthy black malts and I love every moment of the struggle. If oil came from barley, this would fuel jets.

T: No surprises because the smell telegraphs the taste like an amateur against Ali. More of the vanilla sweet cocoa gram up front followed by the bourbon twisted chocolate caramel espresso of a great stout. It's all here.

F: It's like chewing bubble gum that never gets boring nor loses its flavor. Heavy like the punch that aforementioned amateur caught on the jaw though. Sloooww sipper.

Overall this is how it's done. An adjunct stout is never my first choice but, when done right, you get something like this. I don't like it better than the straight up WWS or some of the other simple, three ingredient brews, but it is damn good."

Heavy oily legs form on the glass after a swirl. Aroma is marshmallow and brown sugary initially. This overt sugariness breaks away to reveal roasty and toasty malts with a hearty bitter edge. Underneath is bourbon and late barrel character, which further counteract the initial sugary notes. Flavor profile pushes the same start - marshmallow and brown sugar, in addition to toffee. As these start-up notes fade, hearty barrel, bourbon, and roasty and toasty malts are revealed. The latter hearty notes becomes the storyline the second half, countering the initial sugary notes well. Mouth feel is thick, with a velvety, smooth, and full texture. Overall, while the sugary start leads to a dangerous territory, the following malt and barrel notes balance the whole experience out well.

Now doubling down with a vanilla-riddled, bourbon barrel aged version of that notorious elixir has allowed time to finally catch up with it.



With a thick, oily and onyx looking pour, Marshmallow Hanjee shares barely a trickle of froth before falling still. As its decadent scent of vanilla drifts gently above its sweet and savory roast, the scent of espresso, cocoa and nuttiness permeates an oxidized aroma of sherry, port and soy. Devilishly sweet, the beer's early cloying nature saturates the early palate with molasses, sorghum, vanilla cream and all-things burnt marshmallows.



As the flavors roll along the middle palate, a full and lavish saturation of the tastebuds reveal bold complementary flavors of espresso, bittersweet chocolate, white chocolate, sweet wines and savory sherry, port and madeira. Hinting toward soy sauce, a late and whisky soaked taste of bourbon keeps the complex flavors of coconut, caramel, toasted oak and bourbon spice coming sip after sip.



Heavy, rich and undeniably cloying, the sipping ale is oily and warm on the palate, reserved as an after dinner digestif. A long, rich and fat maltiness clings to the mouth for an impossibly long and spicy aftertaste."

It glugs out of the bottle super thick and tar black. It has a finger and a half head of tight, thick khaki bubbles that recedes slowly to a thin film and collar that retain throughout. Leaves some nice legs on the glass when swirled.



Immediate strong aromas of boozy bourbon are softened by sweet vanilla and lightly toasted marshmallow. Fudgey brownie batter, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, toasted coconut, and charred oak all follow. There's just a hint of figs linger in the background.



The flavor is quite bourbon forward, but very round and smooth. It's like a scoop of real vanilla bean ice cream topped with burnt caramel, artisan fudge, and a shot of high end bourbon. Nothing pops much except maybe the bourbon, but this is quite well balanced.



The mouth feel is thick, but not overly so. It's slick and coats the mouth well, lingering and begging you to take another sip. Just the right amount (only a touch) of carbonation, and a bone dry, slightly boozy finish. Superb!



Overall this is an absolute pleasure of a beer to drink, and a worthy one for my ""last"" of the 250 list! It doesn't blow me away in the flavor department, but it does in its balance and roundedness! Those are things hard to find in modern BA adjunct stouts!

Well happily that guy is drinking something else. Or maybe he meant that KBBS is like Mountain Dew; enjoyed by European-Americans whom the reviewer is afraid of. Bah, who cares?

So KBBS. Looks great poured into a wine stem. Really dark lovely stuff. There’s foam for those of you who judge beer based on foam. Yep, it’s present. Looks like foam too. 

The wine glass is supposed to enable the drinker to easily acquire aromas. This one is heavy on the adjuncts and, as a result, heavy on aromas that should be present but not so overwhelming. I am a lover of all things maple syrup so I enjoy it. Underneath the maple I get pretty standard, decent stout aromas of coffee, cocoa and roasted grain. Maybe mulberries? Yeah mulberries have an aroma and it’s subtle but rather pleasant. The additions aren’t artificial on the nose but just too much. Kinda like someone skipped the basics and went right to breaking the rules. I could go on at length about the fallacy of that approach but you don’t care. 

After tasting many beers and learning how to pay attention to the different aspects of beer tasting, I have found that reviewing the “front,” “back” and finish is not NECESSARILY pretentious, it’s simply that many reviewers are. This one is actually kinda consistent. The nose is pretty reliable in telegraphing the initial flavor. The maple maple maple. Yeah it’s real maple syrup and there’s a lot of it. There’s definitely cocoa and quite possibly vanilla adjuncts present. I am not going to trash this beer because of the adjuncts - I knew that going in. But they’re aggressive. Dark fruit on the finish, for which I am grateful. 

Given the abv and particular adjuncts, I expected a boozy, heavy feel with little carbonation and that is exactly it. Again, pleasant. 

Of course some will reflexively say that the highest rated beers are overrated. In this case I agree but that’s a reactionary approach. This is a very enjoyable beer. Of late I have become increasingly skeptical of adjunct stouts because I truly think that they are too quickly used when experience and talent can produce a world of flavors without just capriciously tossing stuff in a barrel. In sum, the score is ridiculously high. But it’s too good to score it a protest one…"

Holy. Fucking. Shit. KBBS. Beer review #1000. We're finally here. Legendary. I absolutely splurged on this one, but why not? Morbid curiosity got the better of me. I can't think of a better beer to review for this milestone than the highest rated beer in the whole damn world. I do love maple as an adjunct, so I'm (cautiously) optimistic for this one. I guess there's nothing to do now other than popping this open huh?



Pours completely pitch black with no head into the signature branded stemless teku, just a thin tan ring that leaves no lacing



The nose on this beer is an all out maple bomb, but there's a nice subtlety to it as well. I'm picking up on aromas of real maple syrup, light roast coffee, sticky caramel, pecan pie, milk chocolate, toasted oak, and light earthy bourbon



Man, I didn't want to like the taste of this as much as I do. It's not the most complex thing I've ever had but it is so goddamn good for what it is. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sticky maple syrup, caramel candy, milk chocolate, fruity coffee, light oak, toffee, and raisin. The swallow brings notes of fruity coffee, sticky maple, spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, espresso, vanilla ice cream, pecan pie, and toasted oak. Sublime



A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a velvety beer. Finishes surprisingly dry and boozy with a wonderful sweetness



I won't even play around, this is fucking amazing. Not top beer in the world amazing, but it definitely cracks my top 10. This is truly a once in a lifetime beer experience. I will likely never get another bottle again unless I make the trek out to Iowa with @Pru (who I allowed a few sips of this for his review) but I will cherish every sip of this one.

Though, the arriving predominance peers to schemes of an Ayam Cemani, with dyed allocations on provoked (methodical) discharges. Inasmuch as, light charcoal to the late reposed tones of a Cayuga Duck, given the dark purple to aerated grey-green exhales. In conjunction, a fallow headpiece that’s brief in withstanding preservation. Yet, justifiably well-designed, as the accents address the Beaver toned collapse with a Dutch white lip. There is minimal adherence upon the necks fold, as that portrayal comes in balmy, goaded strides. Notwithstanding, the thermal development behind tack-distilled tears, for adequately webbing church windows. To that extent, a multi-layered scene that’s deep for optimization with each intermission 



S: Malt is put into motion and characterized by the sweet/rich lexicons with a thick trek for pure maple, as a slight roasted bite aids in dimension. Thereby, ushering in dark chocolate on sticky toffee, while puck tamping a quad-sized shot in back. There’s a pastiness in the peripheral that fastens the bourbon adhesion to coffee beans. Coupled with, an aerated basecoat for raisin molasses gems, while strolling cold deciduous forests, as red maple and birch bark circumference pine resin. The barrel interiors coat figs and prunes beneath, while malt soothes midriffs above, before synergizing cask complexions. Accordingly, a caramel crème brûlée middle with a touch of frangipane/hazelnut praline, while the blend puts notice on vanilla oak staves. The furtherance becomes rightly victimized, by the prolonged exposure, where opportunities pit meaty leather to spice-pipe tobacco, as marshmallow fondant faints to the barreled derived coconut. This progresses to sawn wood, from the recoiled temperate woodlands, as a balminess curbs brandy to the dried fruit shifts and hard Chimes. In the interim, an oak sediment lingers with a dry hop bite amongst ricocheting malt, as bourbon pitches flat densities to the rhythm behind (soft) tannins



T: A proactive start on clean maple that measures a light bourbon dictation against roasted grains, as esters serenely interweave. The blend fondues oak atop Barhi Dates and Pain aux raisins, while summersaulting around prunes, before paying heed to Lemberger grapes. That aside, foretaste is mainly situated on rich Ganache over maple poffertjes, as a robust earthiness tends juneberries to dark rosin cascades. Mid-palate opens malt to bready dexterities with reacting nuts/walnuts, in the act of a polymer coalescence. Chiefly, a league for barrel mechanics besides toasted grains, as the equidistant hovers around caramelized toffee and chocolate cordials. In a prolonged/timely struggle, the progression veers off of fudge fondant for more complex - wooded - polymers set to vanillin staves, and oaked-smoked book shelves. Moreover, a greenhouse effect that becomes prevalent in the orchestration of deferred intervals. In light of oxygenating restfully across the hours, the blend incriminates Bual, from Madeira regions, and suggests charred figs with dried marzipan. In turn, a distantly placed roasted bite to the inclining warming degree, as the blend’s anatomy codas tarry skins with Mozhee extractions



M: A level of fatness that’s rich in fluidity, for levying a smooth, composited viscosity. The mechanics attend carbonation cautiously, by truncating the spectrum, for warming coordination behind that semi-tamed glueyness. Such factors roadmap a weighing scale, as vitrics breath open air, and course a drying constitute. In passing, the approach offers an adhesiveness without taxing saccharinity, while protracting an earthly bite to waddle an exsiccation with light (caustic) tannin physiques



O: The framework provides a eurythmic nature on maple, with a backing around barrel warmth and an elusive sense to earthy livelihoods. In centering agenda, the woody hop influence remains docile to the gravity behind malts blended depth, yet prompts in for balance and refines ester institution on clocked time. Consequently, forest fruits and backwoods are shrouded, by a tug-of-war sense of heft, but consciously linger with a palate fondness in step"
